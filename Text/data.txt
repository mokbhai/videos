56 House Banquet
Salazar suddenly woke up and Eaton was pressed to the side of the bed before he could react. The pain on the back of his head and neck made him frown. He raised his eyes and met a pair of red eyes that exuded a strong bloody feeling. There was no emotion in them, just blank and indifferent, as if he was looking at an insignificant corpse. These were a pair of eyes that Eaton was extremely familiar with, eyes that belonged to someone who had been wandering in bloody storms for many years. When you see such a pair of eyes, you will not pay attention to the other person's face at all, even if it was almost instantly covered with cold sweat.

"Salazar Slytherin?" Eaton quietly signaled Severus with his hand to be patient and stop him from moving forward. Salazar was too dangerous at this moment, like a vigilant beast on the verge of extinction, and any movement would lead to a fatal attack.

Salazar's hand that was pinching Eaton's neck began to tremble. His body was too weak. "Who... are you?"

"Prince Eaton, do you remember what happened before?" Eaton asked calmly. This Salazar was very different from the previous one.

"Eaton...Eaton...ah, it's you." Salazar seemed to think hard, the emptiness in his eyes gradually dissipated, and then he suddenly realized something, his frown loosened, and naturally relaxed and lay on Eaton, "I'm so tired, where am I?"

Seeing that Salazar seemed to have recovered, Severus stepped forward to help Eaton turn Salazar over on the bed and let him lie down properly. It was just that the force of turning over was a little too strong, and the sound of Salazar falling was a little louder. There was nothing else. Really... Humph, he actually lay on Eaton! ! He also pinched Eaton... Looking at the pinch mark on Eaton's neck, you can see how much strength Salazar used just now.

"Prince Manor." Eaton ignored the pain in his neck. It was not important at the moment. "Your body has started to decay. It has been controlled, but you still cannot overexert yourself."

"Oh." Salazar didn't seem to care about his body at all. "I feel a little hungry... Is that the feeling? I haven't been hungry for a long time. I'm not sure."

Eaton and Severus looked at each other, and walked forward to help Salazar sit on the head of the bed. "You can't eat yet. Tell me, Salazar, is there anything you need to tell me about your body?"

Salazar was stunned, staring at Eaton with his red eyes, and reacted after a while, "Ah, it's okay, as long as I'm not dead, my body will recover." He is a descendant of Quetzalcoatl and a black magician. He has suffered many physical injuries, but he has never cared about it.

"So the great Slytherin doesn't care about his own health at all. Ha, isn't it funny to see others worrying about this stupid question?" Severus was indignant. He and his grandfather had been looking up information and brewing potions day and night, but all they got in return were indifferent looks and perfunctory answers from others? !

"Uh... who are you?" Salazar frowned, his expression turned cold, and his body seemed to be tense. He seemed to have just noticed Severus's presence...

"Who am I to be of no concern to the great Slytherin!" Severus snorted, "I am so insignificant, how dare I trouble you to pay attention to me."

"You seem to have a problem with me?" Salazar raised his eyebrows, narrowed his eyes slightly, and his tone became a little dangerous.

"Some people are so naturally ungrateful that they almost strangled someone's neck. How dare I have any objection?" Severus sneered. Who cares who he is? If you bully Eaton in front of him, you have to be prepared to be poisoned by him. Severus pulled Eaton to the chair next to him and took out a trauma potion. He did not accept any refusal and applied it to the pinch mark on Eaton's neck, glaring at Salazar from time to time.

If he still doesn't understand, then Salazar has lived in vain. He naturally noticed the scar on Eaton's neck. Forgive him for not realizing this problem just now. He felt a little guilty at this moment. You know, thousands of years ago, everything was in danger, and there was no peace and tranquility at any time. Who dared to sleep peacefully? ... He swore to Merlin that he was really acting on reflex just now! Even Rowena and Helga didn't dare to approach him when he was sleeping...

"Um...Eaton, are you okay?" Salazar asked cautiously. Perhaps it was because Eaton saved him, or perhaps it was because of his long-standing gratitude to Prince, he was not wary of Eaton at all, and his true nature was revealed naturally.

Eaton glanced at the red eyes with a hint of flattery, and always felt that it was an insult to these beautiful eyes... "Just take care of your injuries honestly, and consider it an apology to me. Sif, I'm fine, no need to apply so much..."

If Eaton could see his own expression, he would find out...how similar his expression was to Salazar's just now.

Severus still had a cold face, and he applied the whole bottle of potion, making Eaton's neck greasy and watery, ready to be fried in a pan...

After hearing Eaton's request, Salazar immediately sat down obediently, straight and upright, with an obedient look. When Eaton came forward to test his body temperature, he no longer resisted as before. "Actually, my body temperature is always changing. It has nothing to do with the curse. I can feel that the power of the curse has been lifted."

"So what are your plans next?" Upon hearing this, Eaton gave up on continuing to treat him. Since the other party said it was not necessary, they didn't need to waste any more effort, right?

"...You won't take me in?" Salazar was surprised. He thought Eaton would take him in. "I can go back to the Quetzalcoatl residence, but Barrow mentioned something about the Slytherin heir to me before. I guess I need to deal with it. I'll trouble Eaton for the time being."

He is not subtle at all... Is he still the Slytherin who is used to beating around the bush and is cunning?

"You can live here forever." Eaton nodded. Ha, he didn't need to mention Voldemort anymore. His future life as a geek was just around the corner! ! "I'll take you in."

"I knew it." Salazar smiled innocently, with a triumphant expression, which made Severus feel aggrieved. However, even if Severus wanted to vomit blood, he would not say no to Eaton's decision. At least not now.

"That heir can be said to be your descendant. Will you deal with him?" Since he couldn't talk about taking him in, Severus would still feel uncomfortable with this person.

"Descendants? I don't need that kind of thing." Salazar's expression suddenly turned cold, as if the smile just now didn't exist at all. His red eyes were filled with cold murderous intent, which obviously made Severus' face turn pale. Fortunately, Eaton immediately stood in front of Severus when he saw that the situation was not right. Severus still had no ability to resist the so-called killer's murderous intent. After all, the murderous intent of wizards was released through magic power, and the real bloody murderous intent was fundamentally different from this.

"It seems that things were not peaceful a thousand years ago." Eaton sighed expressionlessly, although he didn't mean to sigh at all. "No matter what the situation was between Prince and Slytherin a thousand years ago, now, to the outside world, you will be a member of the Prince family." Saying this is definitely a precautionary measure. Who knows what the situation was a thousand years ago? The secrets of an open family are not enough for an experienced dark wizard, and they are too easy to get. If Salazar is sent away, not to mention Wharton, even he and Severus will not agree, which will cause too much trouble.

"I swear in the name of Salazar Slytherin that as long as Prince is sincere to me, I will not betray Prince." Salazar knew what Eaton meant and immediately swore a magical oath. This was the oath he swore when he and the other three people founded Hogwarts. The oath made with a magical name is at the soul level and is very solid.

Eaton heaved a sigh of relief and nodded to Salazar. "I will explain everything about the wizarding world to you when Grandpa comes back. I don't know much. As for your heir, he killed my parents. Remember to leave it to me."

Sarah agreed after finding out the truth. After Severus and Eaton left the room, her expression turned much colder. She opened her hands and looked absentmindedly for a while, then tore all the clothes with a wave of her hand. She looked at the strips of rotten flesh on her body and expressionlessly used the gradually emerging black light on her fingers to cut them all off and make them disappear. During the whole process, the coldness in her eyes did not change at all. She quickly burned the remaining blood with the flame on her other hand, making the entire wound turn pitch black until it stopped bleeding...

After doing these things, he glanced at the pieces of clothes on the ground and waved his fingers again. The pieces automatically pieced together on his body, covering up his already horrible body.

"…It turns out I'm still alive." A murmured voice with a hint of coldness finally sounded in this empty room.

The Prince family's Christmas dinner was held as scheduled. All the invited families showed up early in a small manor on the border of England. Small is naturally compared to the main house, but the location of this banquet gave the Death Eaters an opportunity to laugh at it.

"Ah, Mr. Prince, why didn't you open the main house? You know, our lord was looking forward to it, but who knew that we would be disappointed. Maybe you can comfort us?" An unknown Death Eater parent sneered with an elegant smile.

"I didn't know you wanted to enter Prince's main house?" Wharton raised his lips with contempt in his eyes, "If I remember correctly, all historical materials record the rules of the Prince's family. The main house is not open to the public. Oh, sorry, I believe this is definitely not your problem. It's just that everyone has their own expertise." How dare you, an uneducated guy, come and provoke me!

The other party was furious, but he didn't dare to say anything even though his face was red. It was because his lord hadn't arrived yet, but Dumbledore had already arrived...

"Congratulations, my old friend." Dumbledore appeared with a smile, followed by Arthur Weasley and the head of the Potter family. As for where that old friend came from... that was unknown.

"Welcome, Headmaster Dumbledore." Unlike Dumbledore's enthusiasm, Wharton's expression was completely as if he was facing a guest. He seemed a little cold, but it didn't matter to Dumbledore.

"This is Arthur Weasley, a friend of Eaton. Just as something happened in his family, Eaton invited him here." Dumbledore pulled Arthur over and introduced him. He knew that Voldemort would also come this time, and there would be many Death Eaters, so naturally he wanted to let everyone know that Arthur also had a backer.

Naturally, Walton couldn't refute a child. He could only nod a little frustratedly, then greeted the head of the Potter family and moved away from this wave.

Voldemort appeared in the middle of the banquet. His well-fitting wizard robes had beautiful silver-green patterns, and his slender body, handsome appearance before his disfigurement, and intimidating red eyes attracted everyone's attention as soon as he appeared, whether they were admired or feared. His Nagini accompanied him, swimming at his feet, and behind him was a group of Death Eaters in standard clothing.

Bellatrix was extremely excited, she never thought that she would have the chance to appear with Lord. Standing behind Lord, her mood was like a broom flying in the sky, her eyes could only see Lord's back, no one else could come in.

"Master Prince, it's an honor to meet you." Voldemort walked naturally to the main seat and sat down. Nagini then wrapped around him, with the huge snake head resting on his shoulders, and its dim eyes scanned the surroundings as the snake head moved back and forth.

Everyone held their breath and prepared to listen to Prince Wharton's answer, but unfortunately they heard Dumbledore's chuckle before they could get it.

"Oh, Tom, it's nice to see you. It's been a long time since we last met. It's been so long since you graduated." Dumbledore sat next to Voldemort without any embarrassment, and the two chairs were in the same position.

"Please call me Voldemort, Headmaster Dumbledore." Voldemort's eyes flashed coldly. He hated Dumbledore's stubbornness. "It hasn't been long since the headmaster rejected my application last time."

"Believe me, Tom, that's not a position suitable for you." Dumbledore still smiled gently, "I keep hearing about you, and I can't believe it's the little Tom I taught. Alas, I'm old."

"Master Prince, maybe you don't mind that I'm a little late?" Voldemort decided to ignore Dumbledore for the time being. Humph, once he contacted Hogwarts, he would be able to expel this old man. There was no need to waste time at this time. "I'm quite busy with my affairs. I'm still dealing with the Hogwarts matter."

"Of course I don't mind. Please feel free to do as you please." Wharton replied with a smile. He then turned to the people around him and said, "The party continues. Perhaps everyone would like to dance." He then went to invite Madam Zabini.

Eaton and Severus were entertaining the backup forces at this time, so they were naturally ridiculed by Lestrange and others. Unfortunately, with Severus's sharp tongue, they could not gain any advantage and were even scolded. Arthur felt relieved. With the persuasion of Headmaster Dumbledore, he understood Eaton's comfort to him, so he was grateful and felt a little guilty about his previous reaction. When he came here today, he wanted to apologize to Eaton, but he saw the Death Eaters before he had time. He couldn't control his anger and wanted to rush up to fight. Although he didn't know who killed his parents, he knew it must be the Death Eaters! Unfortunately, before he could act, the black-haired kid kicked him into an empty room and taught him a lesson, and finally let him go.

"If you dare show any sign of that, you'll go wherever Dumbledore goes!"

If he were alone, it would be fine, but Headmaster Dumbledore saved him and took care of him. He really didn't want the headmaster to be implicated by him. He knew that Headmaster Dumbledore valued the Prince family. So he could only endure the internal injuries. But later he found the fun. Those hateful guys dared to have a quarrel with Eton, and the kid who hugged him actually suppressed those big guys. It was really, too refreshing! ! He decided to worship him from today. By the way, his name is... Severus Snape! !

Then he carelessly stroked Nagini's cold skin and said,

"Mr. Voldemort, please feel free to do as you please." Wharton raised the red wine in his hand towards Voldemort.

"How dare you speak to Lord like that?!" Lestrange was immediately angry. He had just explained Lord's greatness to Prince in a 'kind and polite' manner.

“Withdraw.” Voldemort frowned and glanced at Lestrange who had appeared. He waited until the other party immediately retracted his head before showing his elegance again. “Wharton should remember that I have invited you to dinner many times. Although unfortunately, I have encountered obstacles every time, but it should be almost done by now, right?”

"Oh, I was wondering why Tom ignored an old man like me. It turns out he came to see Wharton." Dumbledore's voice came again. It was impossible for him to give Voldemort a chance to win over Prince.

Voldemort looked at Dumbledore with a sarcastic look, but smiled in understanding. "I still have some things to deal with. I think Wharton should consider my invitation. So, I'm leaving." After that, he left with a large group of Death Eaters who had gathered. Before leaving, Bellatrix, who had been silent all the time, glared at Dumbledore obscurely.

Walton shook the red wine in his hand, looking through the group of figures who were watching him leave, his expression did not change at all, and he chatted with Dumbledore again. Because of the host's indifference, the originally stiff scene became lively again. It is worth mentioning that the head of the Zabini family seemed to be very nervous and followed Voldemort to leave, but left Orville Zabini to accompany Eaton. Lestrange was just the opposite. His son followed him to leave, but the head of the family came down, as if the scene of anger and rebuke just now did not exist at all.
57 House Crack
When chatting with Dumbledore, Wharton did not shy away from the head of the Lestrange family who stayed beside him and refused to move. During the whole banquet, Wharton did not say anything about the reason why the Prince family decided to open up, nor did he deliberately get closer to someone's family, which made the aristocratic circle even more confused. Afterwards, after a vague chat at the gathering of noble ladies, he finally came to a conclusion that he was smooth and tactful. In the subsequent friendships, he still seemed cautious, while the Death Eaters seemed to be much more open and went to the Prince family's potion shop to order a large number of top-level potions without any hesitation. The person who took the lead was surprisingly the head of the Zabini family. Although the head of the family did not openly mention Prince's great achievements, everyone knew it, so for a while, the atmosphere of the entire magic world seemed even more weird and abnormal.

Putting aside the situation in the wizarding world, Severus was facing an extremely severe challenge at this moment. He felt a little nervous. Although he didn't know what was going on, he couldn't help but secretly pinching his hands uneasily. He sat obediently in the chair, with a serious posture and a chubby, white and tender face.

"Have you thought it through?" Eaton sorted the necessary potion materials with his back to Severus. He picked up the Timberwort he had obtained from the Slytherin Chamber of Secrets, looked at it carefully, and determined its growth cycle.

"...No." Severus was silent for a long time, and finally lowered his eyes and answered with some grievance. He didn't know what was wrong at all? Eaton called him over and asked him to think about what he had done wrong, and then he went to make potions on his own. However, he thought about everything from the time he met Eaton to now, and he couldn't figure out what mistake Eaton wanted him to admit. He was always learning, and more importantly, he was meeting Eaton's needs. After thinking for a long time, he couldn't think of what he had done wrong.

"It seems that my words have fallen on deaf ears?" Eaton turned around. Although his expression did not change and he was still expressionless, there was a hint of anger in his eyes. "Has your memory been cleared? You don't remember anything I said?!"

Severus jumped off the chair and stood up. Seeing that Eaton was really angry, he felt very uncomfortable and pursed his lips, "I..."

"What do you mean?" Eaton looked at Severus's hesitant expression unhappily, knowing that he didn't realize his problem at all, and didn't remember the conversation in the secret room. He couldn't help but really turned cold, "If you can't figure it out, don't come to see me again. I don't need someone who doesn't know how to cherish me around me. Get out."

After saying this, he turned around and continued to work. He didn't know how to explain it clearly to Severus. If he continued to take all the dangers upon himself so recklessly, he would not live to see the moment when he truly grew up. Perhaps it was because Severus had been living in learning and training for so many years, and had too little contact with basic social practices. His IQ was too high, and his EQ was too low. But this was definitely not a solution. A venomous snake must look like a venomous snake, and to learn to be a lion you need to have the capital of a lion. If you don't have that, then just be a venomous snake!

"Eaton..." Severus couldn't help but tremble in his heart, "Don't you always speak frankly? Why..."

"No reason, Severus." Eaton still didn't turn around, but paused. "You always expect others to point out your problems. When will you really realize it?! Get out. Don't make me say it for the third time."

Severus took two steps forward, with a begging and sad light in his dark eyes, but he finally clenched his fists and turned to leave. He would definitely figure it out and would never let Eaton down! Although he still had no clue up to this point, he knew that Eaton would not say these words for no reason, and that the decisive words he said were all true. If he couldn't figure it out, Eaton would really never see him again, which he could not accept anyway!

After hearing the door being closed, Eaton lost his patience, threw down the materials in his hand in annoyance, and leaned on the back of the sofa to spread out. This shouldn't be the case. At least Severus shouldn't let others become the meaning of his existence. Family, friendship, love, any kind of love is closely connected to a person's spirit and soul. If the spirit and soul are occupied by one person, then how should Severus enjoy the feelings he deserves? He is not like himself who has completely given up his rights as a human being. He is just a child with a slightly dark childhood! He should not be deprived of the joy of life, and he should not focus his life on a person like him who is unwilling to contact the public from the bottom of his heart. Even if he doesn't admit it, he has begun to feel sorry for this child.

Just like he never admitted the reason why he liked to stay at home, he was unwilling to let others be trapped in their own little world, so he had to find a way to cure Severus of this problem. Eaton covered his eyes with his hands to hide the truest emotion in his eyes. He needed to think about it carefully.

"How do you feel today?" Wharton sat down beside the bed with the potion in his hand, carefully lifted Gettler's clothes, poured the potion into his hand to warm it, and gently applied it to the wound.

"Very good." Gettler smiled. He had been awake for a while. "Don't be so gentle. I'm not made of glass."

Walton glared at Gettler unhappily, and then he attacked him fiercely, causing Gettler to cry out in pain. "If it weren't for the fact that your action was effective, don't think I would waste my time rescuing you."

"Ah, I know." Gettler spread out his other intact hand with a funny expression, "Fortunately I am still somewhat useful, otherwise I would really have to meet Merlin. I guess he would laugh at me when I see him."

"Niller Flamel didn't know that the Philosopher's Stone was used to save you, otherwise do you think he would have lent it to you?" Seeing that Gettler was not a good person, Walton simply poured all the potions on the wound, and then watched Gettler grinning as entertainment. "When you offended him, didn't you expect this? Niller asked to come and observe the condition of the wizard after using the potion in a few days."

"Don't worry, I'll take care of it." Gettler nodded thoughtfully. This time he was planning to draw a clear line between himself and Dumbledore. The result was just as he expected. This time, the relationship between them was completely severed. In this case, he wouldn't have to cause dislike for no reason anymore.

"Salazar Slytherin didn't allow me to get close." Wharton suddenly remembered this incident, "Not to mention those potions, he doesn't need them at all, but looking at his condition, I always feel that something is wrong. Have you heard of dark magic that can produce the effect of potions?"

"If it's him, it's normal to be wary." When Getler woke up and found out that Mr. Snake Ancestor was in Prince Manor, he was stunned for half an hour. He thought it was just a mystery game, but the result was really... unexpected. "As for black magic, I heard that a long time ago when potion makers were extremely scarce, some dark wizards would use some special spells to burn wounds and wait for magic power to repair them automatically. I used to sneer at this. No wizard could bear that kind of pain. But now, I'm afraid it's true."

"I see." Wharton frowned and nodded. He was indeed happy at first, but now he felt that this person was a hot potato. Except for Eaton, he ignored everyone. His expression was very cold and his attitude was very indifferent. He refused to let others get close to him. Even if he allowed him to talk about the situation in the wizarding world, he would spend most of his time staying in the room reading various magical histories, or staying next to Eaton and chatting like a child. It was really... hard to figure out.

At dinner, Severus did not show up. Mitt reported that the young master Severus was sitting in meditation on the back hill. Wharton originally wanted to bring him back, but was stopped by Eaton. This made Wharton and Gettler very puzzled, but Eaton did not intend to explain, but brought up another matter.

"Grandpa, how is Severus' mother doing recently?" Eaton lowered his head and looked at the food on the plate, asking calmly.

"Irene?" Wharton frowned. Why did he suddenly think of asking that unfilial daughter? "She's not dead."

"Then let Severus go meet her." Eaton made this explosive decision expressionlessly. "After all, they are his parents. It's not right not to meet them."

Gettler and Wharton looked at each other, while Salazar, who was sitting at the main seat, was eating without caring about anything else. However, he was more interested in something else. "You will be going back to Hogwarts tomorrow? Eton."

"School starts tomorrow." Eaton had no appetite. He put down his fork after taking two bites. He would never get used to this kind of traditional British food no matter how many years he ate it. "Don't even think about it, Salazar. I won't take you back to Hogwarts, and you'd better not go back by yourself!" If Salazar wanted to go back, it would be too easy. That's the school they built, isn't it? "You are in good health now. Although the magic in Hogwarts is rich, it is not suitable for recuperation. Stay here honestly and don't talk about your physique. If you think a prince hasn't realized your lies for a few days, then go back to your Quetzalcoatl residence." There was no way. Eaton was in a bad mood. He had no mood, ability, or idea to comfort the child.

"...Okay, then I'll let Peeves open the passage between Hogwarts and Prince Manor, and you can come back anytime." Salazar frowned unwillingly, with reluctance in his wine-red eyes. He only knew Eaton, and now Eaton was gone, so he had to stay alone in this place that didn't give him a sense of security. He wasn't worried about anything else, but... he was worried that he would lose control of his mind and kill people in this peaceful era. Rowena and the others who could stop him were not here, and now it was estimated that only Eaton could stop him.

Eaton glanced at Salazar and finally nodded. He had a very deep memory of the look in Salazar's eyes when he just woke up. He was still worried about his family. What's more, he was also worried about Severus.

After returning to Hogwarts, study life became much calmer. Lucius gave those curious people a reassurance at the beginning. He no longer regarded Eaton as a friend. Not only did he sneer and ridicule when they met, but even after returning to the aristocratic circle, he did not have a good face towards Zabini who protected Eaton. It was obvious that the Malfoy family had completely broken up with the Prince family, which made everyone more curious about the reason. But Eaton unexpectedly ignored these things. Except for classes, he stayed in the dormitory alone, and no one was allowed to enter or leave. Usually, except for contacting Zabini and Anne of Hufflepuff more, he didn't pay much attention to others, which made everyone confused.

Time slowly slipped to the end of the semester, and soon it was the time agreed upon by Voldemort and Dumbledore. On this day, the entire Slytherin, except for Eton of course, was in high spirits, carefully dressed up and tidied their manners, and were led by the chief to enter the hall with their chests held high and their heads held high, and sat down, waiting for their lord to arrive.

What was even more surprising was that all the ghosts appeared in the hall as if they had agreed to do so, and each stayed in their own college seat. Dumbledore found Headless Nick to find out what was going on, but what made him depressed was that Nick's answer was

It really doesn't seem real... He said they came to join in the fun, and that being 'locked up' for a while was too depressing, so they're going to be active recently!

Barrow stayed at the long table, no one dared to approach him, so there was no one around him. Everyone was indifferent to his dull eyes, bloody clothes, and heavy chains. However, there were always people who were curious and wanted to confirm some exciting ideas and went against the wind.

"Hello, Barrow." Bellatrix went straight from the sixth grade seat to the first grade seat where Barrow was. "Are you here to greet the master of Hogwarts? No wonder. Hogwarts has been in such a mess for so long that even a ghost would be dissatisfied."

"That's right. I've never seen ghosts come to the hall in such an orderly manner. The Lord is indeed stunning. The heir of Slytherin has returned. The whole Hogwarts must kneel down to welcome him." Seeing his sweetheart coming out, Lestrange hurriedly followed. In the past, the princess ignored him, but now she looked at him with an admiring smile... so heart-warming.

Barrow turned his head to glance at the two confused little wizards, then turned away calmly and remained silent.

"Why don't you speak? Barrow, you are the ghost of Slytherin!" Bellatrix frowned and accused Barrow indignantly, but Barrow remained silent. In the end, she could only return to her seat angrily.

Everyone was waiting earnestly, and the Gryffindors were looking at the smiling Headmaster Dumbledore with some worry. Everyone who knew Dumbledore knew how much weight he had lost after Christmas, and he looked so haggard, which made people worry.

"I wish you all excellent results in the upcoming exams." After the meal, Dumbledore stood up and announced, "Now, let's enjoy this weekend."

After that, the entire teaching staff left one after another, and the remaining students were at a loss. Didn't they say that Voldemort was going to inherit Hogwarts? Where was he...

"What's going on?" Lucius reached out and knocked on the table to quiet the first-year students. "Orville, have you got the news?"

"My father said that Lord will come with those people from the Ministry of Magic, and the magic documents are ready." Zabini was also troubled. Everyone knew how ostentatious Lord was...

"Then let's go back." Lucius nodded. Everyone understood that this might not be open to the public, so they could only leave with regret.

The seniors here also understood the development of the matter. Even though they were annoyed, they had to go back to the lounge. This must be the decision of their lord, and they couldn't disobey. However... Zabini knew the news that even Malfoy didn't know, and it seemed that Zabini had known it for a long time but didn't reveal it.

Dumbledore, who had returned to the headmaster's office, was greeted by the Ministry of Magic officials who were nodding and bowing to Voldemort. At the same time, Severus Snape, under the arrangement of Prince Wharton, returned to Spinner's End, which had occupied all his thoughts...

58 House Wedding
Spinner's End was exactly the same as it was before, and even though Severus' memory of that time was fuzzy, he could still easily recognize it.

"How do you feel, little Sever." The escort, Gettler, held his arm and glanced left and right with a sneer. If Eaton hadn't persuaded him and Wharton, he would never allow his students to come to such a boring place. Knockturn Alley in the British wizarding world is much better than here.

"No feeling." All Severus was thinking about was what his grandfather said to him when they were chatting, what is one's own life, why should he pay more attention to the world around him, such pretentious words could have been said by his academic grandfather?

"Go for a walk by yourself. I'll pick you up in a day." Gettler was relieved. If Siver had any feelings, he would really be worried.

Severus ignored Gettler's Apparition and found a place like a square where he sat under a tall tree. Over the years, Eaton often came back and they met often, but Eaton refused to tell him anything except potions. Even if he made up his mind to admit his mistake to Eaton, the ending was still the same... But he really couldn't think of where he did wrong. If his grandfather hadn't been unable to bear it anymore and came to talk to him, he might not have figured it out even after another year.

Lily Evans and Penny came here to play today as usual, but today was special. In the past, there was no one here, but today there was a boy who looked about their age sitting under the tree, with thick black hair, fair face, melancholy eyes, and clean and decent clothes... For girls of their age, he was really handsome!!!

"Hey, Penny, look." Lily quietly pulled Penny's sleeve, "Have you seen that boy?"

Penny naturally saw it too, and couldn't help but blushing quietly. She suddenly felt embarrassed, which made this always strong girl become a lot more shy. "I haven't seen him before. Maybe he just moved in."

"Let's go and take a look." Lily was determined to get to know the boy, so she pulled Penny and walked over there.

Looking at the small lake in front of him, Severus finally let out a breath, and his eyes softened. Although he couldn't figure it out, he knew that Eaton was worried about him. He didn't think there was anything wrong with taking Eaton as his whole life. He was even happy to stay with Eaton. But since Eaton was worried, he would satisfy him. At this time, he remembered what Eaton had said to him when he was in Hogwarts. He was a venomous snake and would always be a lion. It only showed his stupidity, not bravery. Maybe Eaton was still angry about his behavior of jumping down first without caring about his safety. Blame him for not cherishing his life... Well, Eaton...

"Hello." Lily moved closer to Severus and found that the handsome boy did not notice her and was still looking at the lake seriously. She couldn't help but pout. She had never been treated like this before. Wherever she went, people would come up to her.

Severus glanced sideways at the red-haired girl who was bending over and smiling, then shifted his gaze back to the lake and remained silent.

"Hey, why are you ignoring me?" Lily stomped her feet and angrily accused.

Penny took a look at Severus' expression and immediately pulled Lily behind her. "Hello, I'm Penny Evans, and this is my sister Lily Evans... You've just moved here, right? Nice to meet you."

Lily Evans? A thought flashed through Severus's mind, and he seemed to know this name, "What's the matter?"

Seeing Severus paying attention to them, Lily instantly became happy. She walked past the blushing Penny and sat directly next to Severus. "What's your name? I've never seen you before."

"I'm just passing by." Severus didn't intend to give his name. This was the Muggle world. Although he didn't have such a strong aversion to Muggles, he didn't intend to have any contact with them.

"Why is that... You can move in! I heard that the Jones family is moving away. If you move in, we can play together." Lily was depressed for a moment, but then she immediately revived. The way she danced and jumped, combined with her pretty face and lively expressions, made her look very lively, which would easily make most people like her. Unfortunately, Severus was not an ordinary person.

"Lily, don't be so rude." Penny frowned and scolded. It was obviously her who asked the boy to speak, but Lily still stole her limelight. It was really too much.

"I'm not being rude. I really hope he can live here." Lily pouted and retorted, "Tell me your name. Just call me Lily."

Severus looked at the sky and remembered the task given by his grandfather. He decided to go and take a look. It didn't matter if he just took a look and left. So he stood up and dusted off his body as usual. He turned around and left without even looking at the two sisters, but he underestimated the volume of the two sisters.

"You...you can do this too?" Lily exclaimed, "I saw it. You waved your hand and the dust disappeared, even the leaves."

Severus then realized what he had just done... and froze for a moment, "You saw it wrong, I just swatted it away."

"No way! You just waved your hand and they all disappeared!" Lily approached Severus anxiously and emphasized, "How did you do it? What on earth is that? Can you make leaves float?"

"...Perhaps you can explain to me the meaning of the word 'also'?" Severus grasped the key point keenly. He paid special attention to the pale face and frightened eyes of the girl named Petunia. Perhaps, this girl named Lily is also a wizard?

"I..." Lily was at a loss for words. She couldn't help but glance at Petunia who was winking at her. She had promised her parents not to tell them.

"It doesn't mean anything, Lily, we should go home." Petunia went forward and grabbed Lily and pulled her out.

"Penny, I think he's the same as me. I want... I want to understand." Lily stopped abruptly, her green eyes firm. "Penny, I can't keep going like this. Last time I almost... I can't."

"Lily!" Petunia was really furious this time, "What did you tell my parents? If you dare, I will tell my parents right away."

"Even if you tell my parents, I will tell them. I believe he won't tell anyone else, even if he is different from me." Lily pulled back her hand, took two steps back and walked to Severus' side. "I can make leaves float and flowers bloom. I don't know how it works, you know?"

Severus narrowed his eyes slightly. He really didn't expect that he would meet a Muggle wizard when he came to the Muggle world. This was really an extraordinary fate... "You are a wizard."

"Wizard?" Lily and Petunia shouted at the same time, and they looked at each other in shock. "I...how could I be that kind of evil guy? You lied to me." Lily was scared. She had read fairy tales since she was a child, and what she hated most was the witch who was always treacherous and scheming. She didn't want to be that kind of person!

"What do you think wizards are?" Severus sneered. He was really full of sympathy. No wonder Eaton wanted him to think about his mistakes. He always thought of himself as a lion. It seemed that he really wanted to change this habit! "To lie to you is the same as to lie to a troll."

Lily and Petunia didn't understand the sarcasm, but they understood the content and were relieved. "So...what do wizards do? Is it fun?"

Severus felt that he was wasting time. "I don't have time to waste. Goodbye." Then he turned around and left.

"Hello? What's your name?" Lily asked after him, "Can I ask you questions later? Where do you live? Can I come visit you?"

Severus walked quickly. The square was not far from Spinner's End, and they soon reached the entrance of Spinner's End. When they got here, Lily and Petunia who followed behind didn't dare to follow him. This was a place that their parents strictly prohibited them from entering. It was very scary.

"You can't go in here. There are a lot of bad guys here." Lily tried to hold Severus in a hurry, but he dodged sideways. "It's really scary. If you have nowhere to go, you can go to my house. My mother made delicious cakes."

Severus frowned, why is this kid so annoying? Isn't he busy? It's rare to see a nagging wizard. Especially a Muggle wizard, humph, Gryffindor for sure. After all, he is also a Gryffindor contract holder. Thinking of this, even though he was very annoyed, he still turned to face Lily, "Pay attention to receiving letters when you are 11 years old."

After giving these instructions, he walked into Spider's Tail Alley and no longer paid any attention to the two sisters.

The situation in the headmaster's office was tense at this time. Voldemort asked to go for a walk by himself and did not allow anyone to follow him, but Dumbledore could not allow this, so the situation remained deadlocked.

"Oh, Tom, this is Hogwarts. Can't you sense Hogwarts?" Dumbledore pushed his glasses and said with a smile, "You know, Hogwarts is so naughty that it even changed Slytherin's password in the first half of the semester."

The people in the Ministry of Magic couldn't help but wipe their sweat with their handkerchiefs. Was Dumbledore mocking Voldemort? Well, don't be so arrogant. They were shot while lying down.

"If Hogwarts accepts others so easily, it will no longer be the guardian of Slytherin, don't you think? Principal Dumbledore." Voldemort responded to the move without being humble or overbearing. "If I want to completely solve the problems of Hogwarts, I must act independently in Hogwarts. I don't want anyone to hinder me. I believe that Principal Dumbledore is also worried about the safety of the students, right?"

Upon seeing this, the officials of the Ministry of Magic also followed suit to persuade Dumbledore. After all, Hogwarts was a piece of fat meat, and Voldemort had already promised them that if he inherited Hogwarts, he would hand it over to the Ministry of Magic to run. In this way, who knows how much profit would be made every year!

"In fact," Dumbledore finally spoke after seeing everyone's behavior and expressions, "I have found many rare ancient books recently and finally figured out a small part of the inheritance tradition of Hogwarts. Each of the four colleges has a parchment contract. After signing, one can inherit everything of the college, including portraits and ghosts. But unfortunately, these contracts have been lost for a long time, and the magic circle of Hogwarts has long been closed. Inheritance is no longer possible."

Everyone was shocked by this conclusion, but Voldemort sneered, "Dumbledore, don't be so absolute. You know my identity. I am not necessarily here to inherit Hogwarts. After all, Hogwarts belongs to the entire wizarding world. It's just that because Hogwarts has regained consciousness, I am worried that it will be dangerous to the students in school. I can ignore other things, but I cannot ignore the future of the wizarding world."

These words made the people around them straighten their chests and raise their heads. That's right, the purpose of their coming was for the children, not for the inheritance of Hogwarts.

Dumbledore's glasses flashed. "In that case, I have absolutely no reason to refuse you. However, the end of the semester is coming soon and everyone is busy reviewing. As the headmaster, I still hope that you will promise not to contact any student."

Voldemort felt upset, but he still calmly swallowed his anger and said, "Of course. I will definitely do this."

After everyone left, Dumbledore sat in a chair and pondered, and finally walked towards the portraits around him. He had to ensure the safety of individual students, such as Prince.

Slytherin common room.

"Eton, it's so embarrassing that you didn't see it today!" Lucius on the other side of the two-way mirror looked a little indignant, "I have to tell my dad."

"Your father is really busy, and he has to take full charge of your son's mess." Eaton's two-way mirror showed his side profile, because he threw the mirror aside casually.

"Don't hit me like this, Eaton." Lucius was discouraged. Since he went home and had a serious talk with his father at Christmas, he knew the difficulty of his mission and the crisis of his family's status. He could only contact Eaton secretly. Fortunately, the foundation was well laid. "If... he really inherited Hogwarts, I..." Lucius wanted to tell Eaton about his father's wishful thinking, but he knew he couldn't. In that case, the Prince family would stand on the opposite side of their Malfoy, completely. And he is Malfoy, for the selfish Malfoy, yes, that's it.

"In short, you have to be careful recently." After Lucius strengthened his confidence, he couldn't help but warn Eaton. In fact, although Eaton was a bit sharp-tongued and a bit sultry, he was still no match for those people. He had seen too little of Slytherin's methods. He knew Zabini's mind better than anyone else, and seeing Eaton still contacting the other party without knowing it, he was really worried.

"You think too highly of him." Eaton flipped through the book casually. "Go do what you need to do. The lounge is very lively right now. How can we miss Malfoy's participation?"

"...Okay." Lucius hesitated for a moment, and finally said nothing. He didn't think he had overestimated the Dark Lord at all. This Christmas, he saw him. He was so majestic, so handsome, and had a strong magical pressure. How could he be so frightened and submissive that he could not be resigned to living in the room? The other party was an existence that people could not say no to, a terrifying king. If it weren't for his father's strict warning to him, he would have fallen long ago.

After the two-sided mirror quieted down, Eaton finally put down the decorative books in his hand, thought for a moment, and closed his dormitory. "Hogwarts, I'm going home, everything will be back to normal."

A fireplace passage automatically formed on the side wall, and Eaton returned to the bedroom in Prince Manor once again.

"How is Severus?" The first thing Eaton does when he gets home is always to ask his grandfather about Severus's situation, which never changes.

"Gettler sent him back. Eaton, don't you think you went too far?" Wharton frowned. "I don't think there's anything wrong with Severus doing this. Why do you insist so much?"

"I don't think so." Eaton walked around Salazar and sat on the sofa. "Severus should have his own life. He won't stay by my side all the time."

"Why not? You know exactly what Severus has always wished for. Don't you know why he has been studying so hard? You are depriving him of his goal." Wharton has discussed this issue with Eaton more than once, but Eaton would not give in. As Severus' teacher, Gettler naturally focuses on his students.

"He and I will have our own families in the future." Eaton was silent for a while, and finally sighed and said this reason, "He needs a colorful life, to meet all kinds of people, and to experience all kinds of emotions."

Huh? Wharton was dumbfounded. What kind of reason was this... Wasn't Severus his granddaughter-in-law? He had accepted it for so many years, but his grandson told him to let his granddaughter-in-law get married and have children? Was this a joke... "I say, Eton... tell me the truth."

Wharton couldn't help but sit next to Eaton with a complicated expression. After seeing that his grandson's attention was completely attracted by him, he hesitated for a moment and coughed dryly, "What do you think of Severus?"

"What idea?" Eaton was speechless. What kind of question was this?

"That's right. Don't you want Severus to stay with you forever? Aren't you happy that he stays with you forever?" In the end, Wharton didn't feel comfortable asking about his grandson's emotional problems, so he could only beat around the bush.

"Of course I hope so." Eaton nodded with great certainty and determination, "I am very happy too."

"Well...if I remember correctly, except for Severus, you rejected all the kids your grandfather introduced to you. Can you let others stay with you?" Wharton was suspicious. Could it be that his grandson was an emotional idiot...Well, according to the tradition of their Prince, everyone is an emotional idiot.

"..." Eaton twitched his lips. He just said that. It was impossible for him to marry and have children.

"Then let me ask you another question. Do you want Severus to be with someone else? In the future, you will stay in the house with no one to buy things for you, no one to help you with things, and no one to help you choose satisfactory materials?" Wharton was helpless about his grandson's habit of staying at home. Anyway, he would never leave the manor unless it was extremely necessary. Although he was in school now, he could not change this nature.

"……"Good question, hits the nail on the head, but a butler is a butler, even if Severus has a family, he will not resign... Eaton touched his chin and thought.

"Grandpa, you are changing the subject." Eaton suddenly realized that the topic seemed to have shifted 90 degrees. "I just hope that Severus can have his own life, be a little selfish, and think about himself. This has nothing to do with whether he is with me or not."

Walton sighed. This grandson was really slow-witted, the worst in the Prince family. "Let me put it this way. I have discussed the matter between you and Severus with your parents, and all the ancestors in the family have agreed. Don't always talk to yourself. When you say you want to be considerate of others, you should also understand their thoughts. You can handle the rest on your own."

What do you mean by "all agreed"? What did he agree to? Eaton was confused. What was going on? When did his grandfather not even understand him?

Salazar smiled at the side, and after watching Walton walk out, he noticed the confusion in Eaton's eyes and laughed even more happily, "Eden, your grandfather has agreed to your marriage, so it's better to settle it as soon as possible. I was also engaged when I was your age."

...Marriage?! Eaton suddenly realized, that's how it is...So, the so-called agreement is his marriage with Severus? ! ! ! !

59 House of Mistakes
The word "marriage" struck Eaton's brain blank, and the CPU interrupted unexpectedly.

"Were you engaged when you were my age?" Eaton turned to Salazar expressionlessly, looking at his polite smile, and asked,

"Of course," Salazar shrugged. He was not as surprised as Eaton at the time. "The chances of survival are slim, so of course we should make a decision as soon as possible."

"That's right. No wonder the guy who calls himself Voldemort has such strong magical powers but a simple mind." Eaton nodded seriously. He didn't mind dampening his pride at all.

"...That guy has nothing to do with me." Salazar choked, "How can I have any offspring... Engagement is engagement, but it doesn't necessarily mean marriage. Shouldn't you be considering your marriage with that little guy?"

Eaton nodded with a blank expression, then stood up woodenly, turned around mechanically, and walked towards the door step by step. After a while, he turned back and asked, "What does the magic world think about homosexuality... Is your fiancée a man or a woman?"

"A man." Salazar leaned back on the sofa, crossed his legs, and put his arms on the armrests. He answered with a smile, but there was a hint of irony and sadness in his eyes.

"Oh." Eaton nodded, thought about it, and turned back to sit on the sofa. "You have this feeling? What kind of feeling is that?"

...Does this mean he's a relationship counselor? Well, Salazar didn't know what a counselor was, but he felt awkward, and always felt that he might not be able to find a way to get out of this situation in the right way.

"You're asking the wrong person what it feels like." Salazar's expression was a little cold. This piece of history was a taboo in his heart. "I don't need that kind of emotion."

Eaton frowned, and this time he carefully studied Salazar's expression. "You are not good at hiding your emotions. You don't have to say it if you don't want to. So, what are your plans next?"

Salazar had been with Eaton for a long time and they knew each other well. Naturally, he would not be angry or arrogant. "Let him jump around for another two years. His power is too small now and he is not worthy of my help."

"Whatever you want." Eaton didn't know why Salazar had such strong hatred. It was an outward emotion, and he couldn't admit his mistake. To be honest, if the Prince family and Salazar stood on opposite sides, everything would be too bad.

Even his grandfather had an indescribable fear of Salazar. As for Gettler… he never met Salazar and always avoided him. It is said that he was once pulled by Salazar for a duel, and was frightened by his style of fighting, which was even more ruthless to himself than to others. Even if it was not a duel, he could be so ruthless. He used black magic, which was heard of and unheard of, and all hit the fatal points… But there are also benefits. At least in terms of the attainment of black magic, the Prince family has made great progress.

Salazar managed to suppress the violent emotions that had just arisen. After hearing what Eaton said, his red eyes flashed with some happiness. For that careless indulgence and protection, well, although he didn't know what kind of circuit Salazar's thinking was, he was indeed happy. "What if the Prince family is accidentally involved in the future?"

"As long as the clan isn't wiped out, it's fine." Eaton's mind was entirely focused on the word marriage, so his answer was casual. However, he didn't notice that this answer made Salazar smile like a carefree child.

At this time, Severus was standing by a big tree opposite the home deep in his memory, leaning against the trunk, looking at the shabby house opposite. This was the end of Spider's End, a place no one wanted to reach. A child wearing a clean white shirt and black suit pants appeared here, attracting many people's attention, but unfortunately no one dared to approach, because when the child was stopped by five gangsters when he first came in, his neat and nimble skills, vicious and fierce posture, and sharp and cold eyes were really daunting. Of course, the ending of those gangsters was also an important reason for them to pay attention.

Irene didn't go to pick up trash today because Thomas was beaten and badly injured, so she had to stay to take care of him. Fortunately, she had just earned some money yesterday and could buy some clean and easy-to-digest food. When she hurried back, she immediately noticed the child at the door of her house, and her steps stopped immediately, and her anxious face became blank.

Severus was surprisingly calm now. In his opinion, it was just a mission. As for parents, they had no meaning to him since he was 3 years old. At first, he thought he would have some complicated emotions, but in the end, there was nothing. After thinking about it, he decided not to go in. Just watch, he would come out anyway. It was a while before he realized that someone was looking at him differently from others. He turned his head and saw that it was a woman who looked very old. She was hunched over, with obvious old scars on her face and neck, but her eyes were filled with a complex mixture of excitement and sadness.

Severus stood up and faced her. The image of his mother had become blurred in his mind, but this lady made his memory clearer. However, it was impossible for him to call for help. He just came back to take a look. The scars left by the abandonment back then would never heal.

When Irene saw Severus looking back at him, she immediately shrank back, still tightly clutching the white bread she had just bought. She hesitated to take a step forward, but still hesitated for a long time. Finally, she hardened her heart, turned around, and hurriedly walked into the shabby house, slamming the door.

Severus' eyes darkened for a moment, and he couldn't help but clench his hands, then loosened them. He leaned back against the tree trunk again, staring at the house with a blank look in his eyes.

In fact, Severus didn't have to wait long. After a while, there was a ping-pong sound in the room, and Irene's body fell out of the room through the door, accompanied by a weak shout.

"Go buy me some wine, you bitch. If you can't buy any, don't come back. You just want me to die so you can be free, right? I'm telling you, there's no way!"

"Thomas, you can't drink. You're injured." Irene struggled to get up and held onto the door, begging, "You really can't drink."

Severus suddenly felt a sense of sadness in his heart, he couldn't tell the source, and seeing Irene finally walking out tremblingly, he was really going to buy some wine, but after thinking about it, he decided to follow her.

When they reached a somewhat dark alley, Irene stopped and said, "You, why are you following me?" Her voice was trembling with nervousness, as if she was afraid and worried.

"…Is it worth it?" Severus was silent for a long time, and finally asked.

"This is my business." Irene grabbed her clothes and replied, "What a stranger like you thinks is none of my business."

"What did you give up in exchange for what you have now?! My thoughts are not important. It's your business if you want to live like a parasite. It really has nothing to do with me." Severus' emotions suddenly became agitated, but he finally calmed down. Because at that moment, he finally understood Eaton's worries. If you regard a person as everything to you, then what is a parasite if not a parasite? Without your own thoughts and direction, and blindly taking the will of others as your own will, the possibility of a sad ending is too great. Thinking of Eaton, Severus' heart softened immediately. He was right. He should learn to cherish himself, because only in this way can he truly learn to cherish others.

"Nice to meet you." Severus bowed deeply, thought for a moment, took out two bottles of potion from his arms and put them on the ground, "Scars should not appear on Prince's body. Goodbye."

After saying that, Severus turned and left the alley. He was now eager to go back and admit his mistake to Eaton. This time, he really realized where his problem was! At this time, Severus didn't realize that when he mentioned Prince, Irene in front of him trembled violently and turned back with an unbelievable look.

Voldemort's trip to Hogwarts ended with an unknown result. The members of the Ministry of Magic were all a little dejected. Why is it said to be an unknown result...

"Oh, Tom, you're back. It seems that this trip has been fruitful." Dumbledore pretended not to see Voldemort's dark face and smiled. "Then, can you tell me what instructions Hogwarts has?"

Voldemort raised his chin and narrowed his eyes. "Unfortunately, it seems that what Principal Dumbledore said is right. The Hogwarts contract has disappeared, and Hogwarts' self-awareness has just awakened and has not yet formed the ability to think for itself."

"Oh, I'm glad that Tom has come to this conclusion." Dumbledore nodded with satisfaction. "It seems that Tom can communicate with Hogwarts. This is really a cause for celebration. I believe that he will not disrupt the order in the future, right?"

"Principal Dumbledore, rather than saying that Hogwarts is disrupting itself, it is better to say that certain people's actions have angered Hogwarts. If you want Hogwarts to be quiet and peaceful, the principal himself may have to restrain certain actions." Voldemort would stimulate Dumbledore whenever he found the right opportunity, although he did not discover Hogwarts' self-awareness at all. Even after he entered the Slytherin Chamber of Secrets and woke up the basilisk, he still could not get any information.

"In Hogwarts, I am the headmaster, and only the headmaster. Tom doesn't need to worry at all." Dumbledore responded to every move without any fear. "I am glad that Hogwarts has self-awareness. This way, it will be better able to protect the safety of students. After all, Hogwarts exists to protect young wizards, don't you think so, Tom?"

"Of course, in that case, we'll take our leave." Voldemort stood up and said coldly. He had never taken advantage of Dumbledore, especially verbally.

After Dumbledore sent Voldemort and his group away, he immediately informed McGonagall that he needed an internal meeting of the Order of the Phoenix. Voldemort had not succeeded this time and might be furious, so they had to prepare countermeasures.

60 House of Peace
Zabini sat on his bed in his dorm. After no one was around, he finally had some time to relax. The final exams were about to end, and he was about to go home, but he couldn't tell why. He always felt anxious and didn't want to go home. In the past, he dared to complain to Lucius, at least to relax, but now he didn't dare. This semester, his relationship with Lucius became much colder. Even if they looked the same when they were outside, only the parties involved knew the distance. He had been trying to reestablish friendship with Lucius for so long, but everyone knew the rules of Slytherin, and everything was no longer easy.

He was not stupid. He had not figured out Eton Prince's attitude towards him for such a long time, but what could he do? This could immediately raise the status of the Zabini family in the dark arts. Although it was not as good as the Malfoy family, it was much better than before. His father also secretly asked him to maintain a good relationship with Prince, but he refused to get in touch with the Prince family. This made him suspicious, but his power was too weak. In the end, he could not find out anything and could only give up. He had been fed up with the indifference since he was a child, but there was no one standing by his side to support him anymore.

Holidays were meaningless to Eton, but this holiday was very special because he didn't dare to meet Severus...

"Eden, are you hiding from Severus?" His grandfather finally couldn't stand it anymore and came to the door, "You have decided not to leave your room for the entire holiday, right?"

"There is no plan for this in the near future." Eaton had a stiff face and sat on the sofa flipping through a huge book. His surroundings were filled with piled up books, leaving Wharton with nowhere to step.

"So you don't care about Severus' feelings? He has been looking for you since he came back from the Muggle world, but he hasn't even seen you once." Wharton sighed. He knew that his grandson was frightened by what he said. "I'm old, and I can't control what happens between you. You don't need to consider us."

Eaton snapped the book shut, threw it aside, stood up and looked at Wharton, "None of your business, I'm just thinking."

"Then you have to go and see Salazar Slytherin, right? He has been very fond of picking on Severus recently, and he always uses dark magic." Wharton frowned. He didn't know why this Slytherin suddenly became interested in his grandson. He picked on him every day. Although he and Gettler tried to stop him, they were no match for him together. As a result, they were both injured. Although not seriously, they could not withstand the frequent injuries.

Eaton nodded to show that he knew about this. "Salazar knows his limits. Don't worry, Grandpa. I will think it over carefully." These days, he has read all the books on emotions he could find, including all the books in the Ravenclaw library. In fact, he only needs one answer, either rejection or acceptance, but he unexpectedly cannot give an answer easily. He likes to hold little Severus in his arms, watching him study seriously, and watching him puff up his face and solemnly say that he will take care of him. In fact, this was also what he once asked of the butler. He Xian was able to achieve this, but he could easily tell the difference between the two. Now the goal is to determine where the difference lies.

"Go see Severus, we'll talk about your relationship later." If Eaton didn't go see Severus, Wharton felt that little Severus would evolve into a primitive creature that could be silent but would be a Tyrannosaurus when speaking. "You are so young, you have plenty of time to think."

Eaton thought about it and felt that it made sense. He was only 11 years old and Severus was only 9 years old. It was too early to think about these things... Never mind. It was better to let nature take its course. Besides, Severus was not sure about his feelings at all, so he didn't need to worry about it. With this in mind, he walked past Wharton and left the bedroom where he had stayed for a week.

Seeing Eaton go out obediently, Wharton breathed a sigh of relief, looked around, picked up a book at random, flipped through it, and suddenly the corners of his mouth twitched... "The Secret of Puberty"? What on earth was his good grandson studying these days? Was he really his granddaughter-in-law...

Severus was enjoying the noisy house elves' persuasion to go back to his room, but he seemed to be deaf to it as he sat beside the magical plant garden of Prince Manor, carelessly pulling the leaves of Achnatherum splendens. He didn't notice that Achnatherum splendens was desperately trying to avoid his hand, because his mind was in a state of emptiness. He was very busy during this period, really. In addition to completing countless tasks assigned by his grandfather and teacher, he also had to defend against the sneak attacks of the snake ancestor at any time and anywhere. He had almost no free time. He knew their purpose very well, but it was just because Eaton didn't want to see him... It was just that he was slow to realize his mistakes, so Eaton didn't want him, right? Then, what was the point of him staying here?

"Young Master Severus, your injury hasn't healed yet, you can't move around casually." The elf took two steps forward anxiously. It didn't dare to get too close. The look in its big green eyes was almost pleading, but its young master didn't listen to it at all.

Severus looked down at the Sphagnum Splendens, which was now only a stem left, and remained silent as he watched the stem tremble.

"Severus, what are you doing?" Eaton got the exact location of Severus from Salazar. The moment he saw Severus, he suddenly felt an emotion he had never felt before. He couldn't explain it. It seemed that he was a little embarrassed. Well, in short, he was embarrassed. Fortunately, his expressionless face could not show this emotion.

Severus thought he was hallucinating and his body stiffened instantly, but he did not look back. He just lowered his eyes, pursed his thin lips again and again, and looked a little aggrieved.

"Are you weeding? Or the deliberately planted Achnatherum splendens." Eaton went to Severus' side, sat down, and motioned the elf to do what he should do. Then he saw the poor bare tree shivering.

Severus' body shuddered, and he turned away awkwardly, refusing to look back at Eaton. His hands unconsciously grabbed the still healthy Spathiphyllum next to the bare pole again, refusing to speak a word.

Eaton thought about his behavior during this period and felt a little guilty. Seeing that Severus' shoulders were still a little unnatural, it was obviously the sequelae of the damage caused by black magic. It seemed that Salazar was not as sensible as he thought... He reached out and hugged Severus' stiff body in his arms, feeling the unnaturalness and slight struggle in his arms, and felt even more guilty. After all, he was an adult in spirit, but he was hurting a 9-year-old child. He sighed, reached out and patted Severus' back, then naturally rubbed Severus' head buried in his arms. His black hair was still soft and felt very good.

"I've been... a little busy lately." Eaton couldn't really say the words of apology. After all, he had been thinking about Severus all this time, and the complexity of his heart was really... "I won't do that again in the future."

Severus closed his eyes, and finally reached out to grab the cloth on Eaton's chest, burying himself deeper, but still refused to speak. He wanted to make sure that Eaton had not abandoned him and would not give up on him. Even though he knew Eaton's intentions, he still couldn't stand Eaton's indifference to him.

Eaton wanted to laugh at Severus's action, and he smiled naturally, but unfortunately Severus didn't see it. "Well, your injury hasn't healed yet. I just told you that if you don't realize your mistake, don't show up in front of me. Do you realize your mistake?"

Severus turned his head away. He would not admit his fault. He had originally gone to find Eaton to admit his fault when he came back, but Eaton refused to see him. Now he wanted him to admit his fault? That was impossible! Please ignore the gloating look in Severus' eyes. Eaton would never see it anyway.

Eaton decided to let everything go naturally, so he no longer forced Severus to learn to step out of his own world. He had summarized the books he read, if they were lovers, there must be possessiveness. If they had the opportunity to develop into lovers in the future, then all the previous ones would be in vain.

Walton and Gettler secretly watched the two hugging figures from a distance, and they felt relieved. They had been tormented to death these days, but the two parties acted as if nothing had happened and were still sticking to each other. It was so unfair! No, Merlin was still biased.

"You are worthy of being my student. You found us so quickly." Seeing Eaton patting Severus and turning to look at them with a warning in his eyes, Gettler nodded with great satisfaction.

"That's from the Prince family. The most outstanding heir." Wharton smiled and turned to look at the corner. "Good afternoon, Mr. Slytherin."

Salazar slowly walked out from the corner of the wall, which was obviously empty. His steps were neither fast nor slow, his expression was neither cold nor hot, but his red eyes were filled with obvious arrogance and indifference, and there was a subtle pressure around him. This was all his expressions and images to the outside world, and Wharton and Gettler were obviously used to it. He slowly walked between Wharton and the others, looking at the backs of Eaton and Severus hugging from afar, thinking silently, and after a while, he turned around and left.

"Just like the legendary Slytherin. As expected of a wizard who fought the most terrible Knight Order to the end." Gettler sighed, "I'm afraid the people you rescued are more than the wizarding world can bear."

"As a Slytherin, we can't remain indifferent." Wharton was also clearly aware of this matter during this period, but it still couldn't shake their instinctive admiration for Slytherin. What's more, Slytherin himself was much more powerful than they could imagine. "Also, although I don't know why, with Eton here, the wizarding world will be fine. Of course, except for the Ministry of Magic." The probability of getting Slytherins, who are at the level of elders in the wizarding world, to recognize the existing Ministry of Magic is infinitely close to zero.

"Well, no matter what, I, the Dark Lord, have to be laid off. The existing one probably doesn't even have a chance to be laid off. If you think about it this way, I am still very lucky." Gettler sincerely felt so, so he was not embarrassed at all when he said it.

Wharton glared at Gettler unhappily, not intending to dwell on this issue. He looked at his grandson and granddaughter-in-law tenderly again, then turned and went to the study. He still had some things to do. Voldemort had attacked many of Prince's side branches in such a short period of time, and several people were missing now.

At the beginning of the second grade, the situation changed. Severus was attacked by several wizards when he went out. He didn't have a wand, although his resistance was not weak. After all, these people were not as vicious as Salazar. They obviously had a trick up their sleeves and probably wanted to capture him alive. However, the besiegers were all experienced dark wizards. Therefore, when Severus escaped with the door key, he had been tortured by the Cruciatus Curse for a long time, and several people who followed him were killed by the Avada Kedavra Curse. This incident completely angered the entire Prince family. Gettler personally took action, dealt with some of the wizards involved in the attack, and captured a living person and returned to Prince Manor. This person is the head of the Lestrange family.

The dungeon of the Prince family was extremely damp. When the head of the Lestrange family woke up, it took him a long time to realize his situation. His hands and feet were tied to wooden frames and he could not move at all. There was damp moss all around him, and there was the sound of dripping water. What frightened him the most was not these, but that he could not feel the magic power in his body... not even a little bit.

"Let me go! Lord will not let you go, let me go." He could only shout out loud because he could not bear the panic in his heart. He could not care less. He had been against the Prince family for a long time. However, because the Prince family was always conservative and impartial, and clearly maintained a neutral attitude, even though they were attacked several times by Voldemort, they still did not attack, but instead gathered their own forces. This was why the Death Eaters were even more arrogant. This time Voldemort decided to capture Severus Snape to threaten the Prince family. He thought that he was just a grandson anyway, and with the Prince family's attitude all along, he naturally took the initiative to ask for this good job. Isn't it easy to capture a 10-year-old child... Who would have known that such a child would have such good skills, and this time the Prince family also fought back fiercely.

"Who do you mean by lord?"

An elegant and low voice using standard aristocratic language rang out in the empty dungeon and reached Lestrange's ears from all directions, which made him even more frightened. This was not the voice of the head of the Prince family, nor was it the voice of the man whose face could not be seen who attacked them.

"Who? Come out." He looked around in panic, wanting to escape but unable to, and then his eyes froze... His pupils began to dilate infinitely, and a young wizard in exquisite robes gradually emerged from his eyes. The bright red eyes and the appearance that was obviously different from that of a lord made him unable to react.

"Answer my question." Salazar stepped on the air. The ground here reminded him of a swamp. It was not a good memory. So he was in a bad mood.

"Lord...you, you are the one sent by Lord to save me?" Lestrange was very excited. Although he didn't know if Lord had any relatives,

"Don't test my patience." Salazar slid his fingers in the air, causing Lestrange to scream. As his fingers moved down, a thick black wound appeared on his body, and the flesh around him began to tremble unconsciously, but not a single blood shed.

"Lord... is Lord Voldemort." Lestrange endured the burning sensation, and the wound seemed to be scratched on his soul, the pain was unbearable. At this moment, he was sure that this person was not Lord's man. "Please let me go, Lord sent me."

"Oh, Voldemort." Salazar recalled the knowledge of the wizarding world that Wharton had popularized to him, and finally realized that this Lord was the guy who claimed to be the heir of Slytherin and his own descendant. "The heir of Slytherin?"

"Yes... Lord is the heir of Slytherin, let me go, otherwise..." Lestrange felt that his wound seemed to be getting more and more painful, and his body began to spasm, "Let me go."

Salazar stepped on the air and walked in front of him, "Why should I let you go? But I have a question. If you answer it well, I will consider ending your suffering."

"I said, I said..." Lestrange's mind had begun to blur. All he could think about now was how to relieve the pain.

"Salazar Slytherin has no offspring. Why do you believe he is the heir?" Salazar sneered, stretched out his hand to pinch Lestrange's face and turned to him, "Shouldn't you find a more reasonable excuse to slander me?"

"What...what do you mean?" Lestrange was so frightened by the words that he instantly forgot his pain and his eyes became much clearer.

"What I mean is, I'm still alive, and what I hate most is someone slandering me." Salazar gradually increased the strength of his hands, and looking at Lestrange's wide-open, terrified eyes, his eyes became colder.

"Don't kill him, we need him for something else." Eaton took Wharton and Gettler into the dungeon. It was naturally Eaton who spoke out to stop Salazar.

Salazar put down his hand upon hearing this, "You guys are really quick. Don't worry, I won't kill him."

"Your injuries haven't healed yet, so don't abuse magic at will." Eaton was the most angry of all. Looking at Severus' body that was still twitching from time to time, his heartache had reached its peak, and he even wanted to kill all the Death Eaters.

61 House: School Enrollment
"Prince...let me go. Ya*wen*romance*first*release" Lestrange saw the head of the Prince family coming and immediately suppressed the shock and panic just now, "It's useless for you to arrest me."

Gettler already had a deep understanding of this man's stupidity, otherwise he would not have chosen him to live. "As the head of a noble family, your words clearly abandon the elegance of a noble."

"What do you want... Do you think you can deceive the Lord by finding a guy with red eyes who you don't know if it's real or not..." Somehow, Lestrange suddenly toughened up, even though his body was still twitching in pain and he was sweating.

Oh, Merlin... Gettler turned his head away reluctantly. This guy is really annoying. Doesn't Salazar like others mocking his red eyes...

"Salazar, being half dead won't do." Eaton wanted to sigh. He felt very satisfied and relieved that Salazar had scratched a few more scars on the guy's body, but being alone was completely incapable of satisfying his desire for revenge.

Salazar snorted coldly, but finally put down his index finger. "Don't let me hear any more insinuations about me. Otherwise, I will kill him and catch someone else. That won't be a problem for me."

Wharton looked coldly at the painful groans of the head of the Lestrange family, who had been chatting and laughing with him not long ago, and took out a bottle of potion from his arms and drank it without saying a word. Looking at the other party's eyes that almost became blank immediately, a cruel and bloody smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

"It's rare to see you so much like me." Salazar said this out of nowhere, making Gettler choke.

"I know everything I need to know, Grandpa. Severus, I hope you can go to Hogwarts with me." Eaton didn't even look at the miserable captive. His focus was never on this person.

"I'll find a way." Walton nodded, and as he spoke he pulled up Lestrange's sleeves, where the snake on the Death Eater's dark mark was still slowly crawling.

Salazar glanced at it and said, "Master-servant contract? It feels so cheap to be called my descendant by a guy like this."

"You should be thankful that he didn't take over the entire Hogwarts under your name." Eaton had no problem with Voldemort coveting his position, but it was wrong for that guy to enter Salazar's Chamber of Secrets without permission to contact the basilisk, causing Slytherin to warn him! At least don't disturb his peace. Now it's even more cruel, he actually hurt Severus, and it would be too easy for him to die like this. He wants him to die slowly in despair.

"Just based on this fake?" Salazar curled his lips in disdain. This really didn't fit in with his cool image. "But, Eaton, you're glad you chose the Slytherin Contract now, right? It's the most sophisticated of the four colleges." Speaking of this, Salazar couldn't help but feel a little proud.

Eaton turned and walked out of the cell, but his low voice still reached Salazar's ears, "Ravenclaw is indeed quieter..."

"Hey!" Salazar was anxious. He disappeared from the spot and appeared next to Eaton in an instant. "You have already signed it. You can't change it casually.

"So you mean it can still be changed?" Eaton walked and side-glanced at the anxious Salazar. Sure enough, this kind of Salazar who revealed his true nature was the cutest. The guy who usually pretended to be so cool was really not cute at all.

"No." Salazar simply walked backwards facing Eaton. He didn't worry about bumping into him anyway. "Oh, by the way, let's go check on Helbo when we have time. I wonder if the little guy is still alive."

…

Wharton was still studying the master-servant contract that Salazar had mentioned. When he heard the conversation between Salazar and his grandson, he felt something was not right. He lowered his sleeves and looked back at Gettler who was thinking, "Why do I hear... Eaton inherited Slytherin?"

Gettler nodded in confirmation of Walton's puzzled inquiry, "That seems to be the meaning."

...What the hell is this! He didn't even mention such an important thing to him?! If it weren't for what happened today, would he never tell him in this life! !

"Well, let's get down to business first." Gettler was also very depressed. After all, he had fought hard to take back the fatal Elder Wand from someone for that matter. How come in the end, apart from the successful rescue of Salazar, he didn't know anything else...

Wharton decided to have a good talk with his grandson later; right now, studying the contract was the most important thing.

After leaving the dungeon, Eaton stopped chatting with Salazar and told Salazar seriously, "I don't want Voldemort to die too easily, so you can only see your fake offspring at the end."

Salazar wasn't really interested in this, so he didn't care. "It doesn't matter. I'll leave it to you to play with."

That's good. Eaton nodded. "I know you've been thinking about going out recently. There's no need to hide it. The wizarding world has been too peaceful for too long. It can't be active without some excitement."

"How did you know I was going out to play?" Salazar widened his eyes in surprise, earning Eaton a displeased look. "I was just a little bored, so I went out to see if my old friends were still there."

"Stop! You can go find them, but you are not allowed to bring them back!" Eaton knew exactly what old friends Salazar was talking about... They were all primitive magical creatures, right? If they were to go to Prince to pretend to be original, with that much destructive power, would their manor still be worthless! The otaku always has a mansion!

"If you don't want to bring it, then don't bring it. Why are you so fierce?" Salazar was still aggrieved. The grievance in his wine-red eyes replaced the previous arrogance and indifference. He looked pitiful.

"...I said Rowena Ravenclaw didn't leave any portraits or anything like that?" Eaton admired Salazar's expression expressionlessly for a long time, then uttered,

Salazar's expression froze for a moment, and then he turned his back to Eaton awkwardly, "No, at least in Hogwarts, I can't feel their souls."

They... Eaton narrowed his eyes slightly, not knowing what he was thinking of, but in the end he said nothing. He just bypassed Salazar and went to find Severus. These days, he accompanied Severus every day and held him to sleep at night, because he was worried that this incident would bring some psychological shadow to Severus.

It is not known what kind of deal Wharton made with Dumbledore, but the headmaster specially approved Severus Snape to stay in Hogwarts one semester in advance, but Severus flatly refused this with a very tough attitude.

"Don't impose your will on me. I won't go, Eaton." Severus rarely smiled since the day he was attacked. He showed some emotion only when facing Eaton. When facing other people, he always had the same expression, which was... no expression. He was getting closer to Eaton's expressionless face. At this moment, he was firmly rejecting Eaton's request.

"Severus..." Eaton frowned and pulled Severus, who was standing stubbornly, to sit beside him.

"Don't say anymore, these are my business." Severus stood stiffly beside Eaton, turned his head away abruptly, and refused to look at Eaton. He was worried that Eaton would see the emotions in his eyes.

Eaton knew what Severus was thinking, but this made him feel even more distressed. However, he knew that Severus would not change his mind, so he could only sigh and hug Severus's little body again, soothing the stiff body in his arms until it became soft. "Take good care of yourself, Severus. I am still waiting for you to explore the mysteries of Hogwarts together. I am very interested in Gryffindor's collection."

Severus nodded, "I will." He would never allow anything that happened to him to happen to Eaton. He was the target of the Prince family. If the target was gone, those people would definitely target Eaton. He could not bear the possibility of this happening even if there was only a fraction of a percent chance of that happening.

Eaton whispered the plan in Severus' ear. He wanted to reassure Severus that Voldemort would not set his sights on Prince for at least two years. This period of time was enough for them to implement their plan. If they hurt Prince, they would definitely have to pay a price.

Eaton's second year was very dull, at least in his own opinion. He ignored the group of people who gossiped about Prince. Slytherin's attitude towards Eaton was even more abnormal. First of all, Chief Irwin had graduated, and Bellatrix became the chief of this term as she wished. She was always looking for trouble with Eaton, and the reason was naturally her lord. She tried to make trouble for the Prince family many times but failed, and also attracted a counterattack from Dumbledore. In the end, she had to temporarily give up her actions against the Prince family. This made her, who had just been honored to be allowed to join the Death Eaters, very intolerable. Naturally, Eaton Prince became her vent, and sneak attacks, insults, and sarcasm were everywhere. Because of her leadership, the children of the Death Eater family all rebelled against the last They were just bystanders at the beginning, and began to target Eaton everywhere. Although they would not hurt him openly, they used dark magic in secret. After all, they thought that the rules of Slytherin were that all fights were internal and would not be publicized. The custom of swallowing bitterness was still very beneficial... Unfortunately, their attacks became their suffering 100%, including Bellatrix, who never got the upper hand. They could not say no to Eaton's venomous tongue when insulting and sarcasm. They were injured by sneak attacks, accounting for 98% of them. The other 2% was because Eaton was busy and not in the mood. This made Bellatrix even more angry. She wanted to gather everyone in the lounge to teach Prince a lesson, but she was persuaded by her sister, Narcissa Black, who had just entered the school. No one knew what Narcissa said, but Bellatrix learned her lesson after that. She ignored Eaton and ignored him. Although others would occasionally stir up trouble, they would not act easily. Secondly, Zabini gradually stopped playing the aristocratic game with Eaton, and instead began to carefully reveal his distress when talking to Eaton, and he never tired of doing so even if he didn't get a reply. Thirdly, Lucius still kept his distance from Eaton, but the chats with the two-way mirror became more and more frequent. After Voldemort failed to successfully inherit Hogwarts, it was obvious that his father Abraxas had regained his balance. Lucius himself became more and more skilled in playing the aristocratic game, and he was able to maintain it easily. When chatting with Eaton, he no longer mentioned any gang disputes, and all content in this regard was blocked.

Things in the wizarding world seemed even more boring. No one knew what happened inside the Death Eaters, but the disappearance of several famous Death Eaters spread throughout the wizarding world. The news that the head of the Lestrange family was seriously injured was completely blocked by Voldemort. The strange extent of the wounds on the body of Lestrange, who was found in Knockturn Alley by the Death Eaters sent by Voldemort, attracted Voldemort's full attention. He did not allow anyone to treat Lestrange's injuries. He did everything by himself and even captured many well-known potion masters for research. Lestrange was extremely grateful and loyal and expressed his willingness to study with him, which greatly increased Voldemort's favor for him and even made use of his two sons. I will not go into details here. Another thing that made Voldemort even more unable to act rashly and also shocked the entire wizarding world was that another handsome young man with red eyes appeared in the wizarding world. Although he was only seen by a few people, his elegant manners and impressive eyes and expressions immediately attracted the attention of the entire wizarding world. When the news reached Voldemort's ears, it had already caused a sensation. He could only quickly send people to investigate the entire Slytherin family. Similarly, he had unknown worries in his heart. He was a half-blood. If a pure-blood Slytherin appeared, he had to kill him first to feel at ease. This was just the right time to make a Horcrux. Voldemort, who was busy with these, could only put aside the affairs of the Prince family for the time being.

Time slipped to the day when Severus entered school. Eaton helped Severus put on his robes and looked him up and down. "Severus, you have grown up." He was very emotional... What was this feeling of a son growing up like this...

"I should be the one saying this." Wharton wanted to rub Severus' head, but he dodged it expressionlessly. This made him feel very aggrieved. Severus had become not cute at all in the past year.

"Severus is mine." Eaton touched Severus' hair. This time Severus did not hide and let Eaton do what he wanted. Because of Eaton's words, Severus couldn't help but blushing for unknown reasons.

"Okay, it's yours." Gettler pulled the dark-eyed Wharton over and motioned him to pay attention to Severus's slightly red face. He also hinted with his eyes that if he disturbed someone else's love, he would be struck by lightning...

62 House Branch
The Hogwarts Express was as shabby as ever, and the steam device was undoubtedly intact, but this did not prevent the little ones who came every time from chattering excitedly. Severus did not belong to any of them. He just sat quietly with Eaton in the middle box and read books together. However, the two had completely different research directions. I don't know when Severus fixed his direction on potions and dark magic, and he gradually put down the others. At this time, he was holding a collection of books left by the ancestors of the Prince family. The atmosphere in this box was warm and quiet.

Bang, bang, bang…

"Is anyone there? Is anyone there?" A lively female voice sounded as the knock on the door sounded.

Severus frowned, put down his hand, and looked at Eaton's expressionless face as he glanced at the door, frowning even more. There was no way, almost all students knew that the middle compartment of the Hogwarts Express was exclusive to Prince, and he always stayed in this compartment, and every time he would set a spell to prevent others from disturbing him, so the old students were used to ignoring this compartment, and the freshmen gathered in the back half of the compartment, thinking that there was little disturbance, which was why Eaton did not set an ignoring spell this time but only a locking spell. Who knew that someone would come to disturb him this time... Would he really be struck by lightning?

Severus stood up and opened the car door. He was slightly surprised because the person opposite him happened to be someone he had seen before...

"Ah, I found you!" Lily cheered excitedly, "I knew you would be there. It's worth my searching for so long."

"What do you want?" Severus stood at the door, rejecting Lily's plan to enter the box. He had some impression of this girl, but it was not a good impression. By the way, the word "lively" is really not suitable for the Prince family.

"I came to see you!" Lily's eyes widened, her green eyes full of joy. "You said you would definitely receive the admission letter when you were 11 years old, but Penny didn't believe it. I said you would definitely not lie to me."

"So?" Will this man get to the point? Severus felt his patience running out...

"Can I go to your box? I can't even find it." Lily lifted the luggage in her hand, looking a little strenuous. It seemed that she had really been looking for someone with the luggage.

"No..." Severus frowned and was about to refuse when he heard another loud voice interrupt him.

"Hey, pretty girl, I found you." A handsome boy with messy hair ran up to Lily excitedly, followed by three freshmen who were panting. "I just called you, why did you leave? Come to our box, we don't have any room. Come, let me help you with your luggage."

As he said that, he went forward to grab Lily's luggage bag, but Lily slapped his hand away, "What are you doing! I don't know you, go away."

"I'm James Potter, the only son of the Potter family~" James didn't care about the pain on the back of his hand at all. Instead, he scratched his messy hair with a silly smile, "I know your name is Lily Evans. Now we know each other, right? Let's go."

Lily moved her luggage and took two quick steps to the side of Severus, who had an expressionless face. "I found a box. I won't go to your box. Besides, there are four of you, right?"

James only saw the person standing at the door of the box at this time. He had to be familiar with this person. After all, most of the Prince family's affairs were handled by the head of the family with his grandson. "Severus Snape? Why are you here?"

Sirius, who was standing behind James, was also stunned for a moment. He had no choice. He had just seen Severus. As the eldest son of the Black family, he obviously knew Severus much better than James. "My little beauty, the people of the Prince family cannot be disturbed easily. Let's go to our box."

The remaining two freshmen looked at each other in bewilderment, and could not help but look at this very famous grandson of Prince. As a half-blood, he was recognized by the Prince family. His talent in potions had long been known throughout the magic world, especially among several black wizards a year ago.

The news of surviving the attack of the division has long become a household story, full of thrills, excitement and bravery.

"No, we've been friends for a long time." Lily pouted angrily and retorted. She was actually quite guilty. She only just realized that the person next to her was called Severus Snape. But... it seemed that there was a weirdo named Snape in Spinner's End? Also, when she first met Severus, he seemed to have entered Spinner's End.

"Severus? Let your friend in." Eaton had gotten behind Severus at some point, and holding Severus' hand from behind, he opened the door of the box. By the way, he saw the little beauty with red hair and green eyes. She had big eyes, an oval face, fair skin, and cherry lips. Normally speaking, she was a real beauty.

"No need." Severus frowned again and refused coldly. He didn't want anyone to disturb him and Eaton.

"You are... Potter, Black, and..." Ignoring Severus's answer, Eaton politely said to the four stunned people opposite him, "Who are these two?"

The four people who met the legitimate heir of the Prince family for the first time were a little uneasy, although the person opposite was very polite, "Um, I'm Remus Lupin, and this is Peter Pettigrew, hello."

"Hello. If you don't mind, we should go back to the box." Eaton nodded at the four freshmen. The curiosity in their eyes was so obvious that Eaton was not used to it.

Lily Evans originally thought that Severus was a cold and hard man who didn't care about being sad, but when she saw that she could join his box, she was immediately happy. She had time to look at the senior who came out. Wow, he is much more handsome than Severus. He also has black hair and black eyes, but how can he be so elegant and so imposing! ... Well, Lily was infatuated for a while.

"Hey, well, you don't mind if I'm in this room too, right?" James came to his senses and saw that the goddess in his heart had already entered the room, and the door was about to close. He immediately stepped forward and forced the door open with his hands, and then Sirius also came to help.

Severus turned around with a completely dark face, coldly looking at the two guys in front of him who were shamelessly clinging to the door, feeling even more depressed... Was it a wrong decision to choose Gryffindor? ! "Are your limbs unable to bear the blankness of your brain? What's more interesting is that the brain replaced by the troll has even lost its eyes. Can't you see that we don't welcome you?!"

"You...you are too arrogant!" James was furious. "Don't think you can bully people just because you are from Prince's family. I won't take it seriously! Isn't he just a snotty guy? Lily, don't you see how bad this guy is? Let's go. Don't stay with such a hateful person. You will also be implicated."

"James Potter, Severus is my friend! Who allowed you to say that about him? It's obviously you who are wrong. You have your own box, so why do you want to occupy someone else's box? Apologize now." Lily actually only heard the last sentence of Severus's previous words. She agreed with them very much. She personally did not welcome James and his group very much. They were disgusting.

Sirius held back James who was about to rush over. He was actually quite helpless. This friend he just met seemed too impulsive. Could the Prince family be easily offended? Didn't you see that even Voldemort was helpless? But this is also the characteristic of Gryffindor, which is understandable. "Your compartment is also short of one person. This train is the property of Hogwarts. As long as you are a student, you can ride it."

Lily was speechless. She really couldn't refute this. She could only put her hope on Severus. So she began to look forward to seeing Severus go...

Eaton had been watching all this silently, except for his eyes darkening when he heard Snotlout. Now he had to speak up because he saw Severus's furious look. "Severus, come and sit down. You can do whatever you want."

Severus swallowed the venom that he wanted to spray at first, and glared at the two complacent people. He sat down next to Eaton with a cold face, and let Eaton cast a Silence and Ignore spell. It took a long time for him to recover his expression, and he took out the collection again and read it quietly. As for what happened on the other side? He said he didn't see anything.

James nudged Sirius with his elbow to express his gratitude, then sat down beside the angry Lily. He was glared at by her angrily, but he didn't mind at all and continued to smile foolishly. On the contrary, Sirius, who was standing at the door, secretly observed the pair of brothers opposite, and couldn't stop the envy in his eyes. Everyone in the magic world knew that the children of the Prince family were free to do whatever they wanted, and their parents only spoiled and protected them, and didn't care about anything else.

Remus and Pettigrew stretched their heads from behind Sirius to take a look at the current situation. In the end, they pulled Sirius away, closing the door gently before leaving, and the three of them returned to their own box together.

"That Prince... is so polite." Pettigrew grinned to himself for a long time and said this. No noble had ever greeted him so politely. He always looked at people with his chin raised, so he was excited for a long time just because of a greeting.

Remus didn't answer, but rubbed his fingers silently. He was thinking, after being bitten, his parents wanted to ask the Prince family for help, and even asked Headmaster Dumbledore for help, but they were unsuccessful in the end. This time when he came to Hogwarts, his parents also hoped that he could build a good relationship with the two children of the Prince family and try to get their help to study the potion to remove the wolfsbane.

"You're not familiar with them yet." Sirius replied nonchalantly, "Neither of them is easy to get along with, don't judge by appearances."

"Sirius... do you know them?" Pettigrew's eyes were twinkling.

"I know him, but not familiar with him." Sirius was lying on his seat. James just happened to leave, so he took up the entire long seat. "That senior Prince has never appeared in social activities, so I haven't seen him. I have seen that Snape a few times, but he always had a blank face." Sirius frowned and imitated Severus' expression, which made Remus, who had come to his senses, burst out laughing. There was nothing he could do, Sirius' face was really not suitable for this blank expression. "And he speaks quite venomously, no matter who he talks to. His family protects him and doesn't care at all." Sirius did not hide his jealousy at all. His family would only nitpick on his behavior, saying this was not good and that was not right. At one point, he even imitated the expressionless face of the Prince and started to spit venom, which led to another round of criticism and education.

"Wow..." Pettigrew exclaimed, becoming even more envious.

"Hmph." Sirius snorted coldly and stopped talking. He kept looking out the window, thinking about his own thoughts.

The Hogwarts Express was about to arrive at Hogwarts on time. Eaton lifted the spell. He and Severus had already changed into robes, so it didn't matter. However, Lily was a girl, so it was not very convenient, so Eaton took Severus out of the compartment and prepared to get off the train. James was still chattering without realizing it. After being interrupted by Lily, he realized the problem. He ran out of the compartment with a red face and hurriedly changed his robes.

"Freshmen, come here. Oh, Eaton, you can't go with you. You have to go over there." Hagrid was still shouting beside the car. When he saw Eaton holding Severus' hand, he immediately smiled happily. In the past two years, he had a lot of contact with Eaton. Eaton also helped him heal all the bites he had suffered, which made him even more grateful.

"Got it, Hagrid." Eaton pulled Severus in front of him, "Get the magic lamp, and see you at Hogwarts."

After seeing Severus nod, Eaton said goodbye to Hagrid and went to the third grade team, where Zabini and Lucius, who was chatting with Zabini with his chin raised and pretending not to care, were waiting with Crabbe and Goyle.

Seeing that Eaton had left, Lily quickly took the seat next to Severus, "Severus, it's so dark in here, is the magic lamp for lighting?"

Without Eaton by his side, Severus didn't bother to hide it at all, "Please don't follow me, Miss Evans, and don't make friends casually. We are not friends."

Lily let go of Severus' sleeve with a somewhat hurt look on her face, and looked at him with watery eyes. "How can you say that? It was you who told me about Hogwarts, and you who told me I was a wizard. I only know you here, and I thought we were friends for a long time. Why do you deny it? Is it because of that annoying person just now? I knew that person was so annoying." Somehow, Lily blamed all the faults on James, and felt even more disgusted with him.

"Don't..." Severus was about to say, 'Don't put the blame on others. I hate people like you who are self-righteous and think they are princesses even though they have nothing.' However, he was interrupted again, which made him temporarily lose the chance to ask for help.

A trouble.

"Snotlout, are you bullying Lily again?!" James always arrives at the right time. He rushed to Lily's side again.

Severus narrowed his eyes slightly, and just as he was about to speak, he heard Hagrid's voice, "Oh, you are Severus, right? I know you. Eaton always mentioned you to me. Come with me. Freshman, follow me!" It turned out that Hagrid saw all this and thought

Someone was going to bully Severus, and he immediately became anxious. This was Eaton's beloved younger brother, so he came to be a backer. Not to mention, when he interrupted, James and Sirius who wanted to speak could only stare at the tall mountain in amazement.

Guys, there's nothing to say. Even Lily is no exception.

While the freshmen were focusing on Hagrid, they had already stumbled to the edge of the Black Lake without realizing it. James came to his senses late as the boat with four people in it was occupied by two other freshmen. He could only share a boat with three new friends. However, during the entire boat trip, he had been staring at the goddess in his heart in the darkness. Although he found out after landing that he had been staring at the wrong direction and the wrong person...

Professor McGonagall was as serious as ever. She was very satisfied when she saw the nervous freshmen. She led everyone into the auditorium and started the sorting smoothly.

"Lily Evans." Mag's voice startled Lily, who was beginning to be frightened. She couldn't help shrinking her head. Finally, under everyone's gaze, she secretly glanced at Severus, who was staring straight ahead. She encouraged herself, walked up slowly, and put on her hat.

"Gryffindor." The hat called out the word gently, which made James extremely excited.

"Wow, that's great, she's in the same college as us." At least James knew to control his volume. He secretly tugged at Sirius' robe and whispered.

Sirius looked at James with some complexity, hesitated for a moment and said nothing. He secretly glanced at Eton who was sitting in Slytherin. Although people around him were whispering, he could be quiet and ignore everything around him. Could he be like this too? He didn't like dealing with those people at all, but he also didn't want his family to be sad.

James didn't mind Sirius' silence, since his mind wasn't on that anyway.

"Sirius Black." When McGonagall read out this name, the entire Slytherin fell silent. Narcissa Black was a little nervous. She knew her brother too well. He was extremely rebellious. Who knew if he would have any problems and choose a college that Black could not accept.

Sirius, who was pushed by James, kept his head down. He sat on the chair and put on his hat, but still didn't look up, so no one saw his expression.

This time the hat took a long time, and Sirius' body became increasingly stiffer, until the final word came, "Slytherin."

Phew… Narcissa breathed a sigh of relief and led the applause. Her smile became unusually genuine. Since the little Slytherin princess had applauded, the entire Slytherin immediately applauded in unison to welcome her.

James was dumbfounded. Pettigrew and Remus were both in Gryffindor, and he thought Sirius would be there too, but how... This was too strange. Sirius himself said that he was very likely to be in Gryffindor... Although Gryffindor and Slytherin were not at loggerheads with each other, they were almost at loggerheads... Prince was a special case. How were they going to get along in the future...

James was sorted into Gryffindor in a daze. He sat down and stared at Sirius who was sitting at the end of the Slytherin class with his head down. He didn't even rush to find Lily Evans.

"Severus Snape."

The hat knew very well that this person was a Gryffindor bondholder...but...

"If you dare not sort me into Slytherin, be prepared to be doused in potion." Severus threatened without hesitation. He was furious about the hat's hesitation, including on the train, and he was ready to vent it all on this broken hat. "It's really an old, broken hat. If you can't even sort us, I don't mind changing the way we sort us." The contractor really has this right.

"Slytherin!" The hat didn't hesitate this time...
63 House of Big Dog
Severus fulfilled his wish and no longer bothered about the shabby hat. He took it off and handed it to Professor McGonagall, then walked towards the Slytherin table with great momentum, the corners of his black robe flowing smoothly like ripples.

The Slytherin people had known Severus for a long time, so they naturally left an empty seat next to Eton, so Severus didn't need to go to the freshmen's side. However, Severus was unwilling to accept Slytherin's kindness. As a Gryffindor contractor, he naturally knew the rules within Slytherin College very well. He didn't want to give others the impression that Eton was protecting him. He wanted to create his own world, so that he would have more powerful power to protect Eton in the future. So, he also walked directly to the end of Slytherin and sat next to Sirius.

Eaton knew Severus's thoughts very well, so he just smiled at him to welcome him when Severus passed by. This smile shocked everyone who saw it. Everyone knew that no one had seen Prince smile in the past two years. Hufflepuffs were even secretly betting on who could make Prince smile. Just like that, everyone immediately admired this black-haired, black-eyed, imposing grandson of Prince.

"I thought you would be with Eton Prince." Sirius had just lowered his head, but this time he raised his head, with surprise in his eyes, "Weren't you two doing well on the train?"

Severus immediately frowned and gave Sirius a stern look, "Is the function of Black's eyes to keep an eye on other people's affairs? Your ability to meddle in other people's affairs is more like Gryffindor. It seems that you have chosen the wrong house."

Sirius choked, then stared at Severus, "What do you mean I chose the wrong house? You have a problem with that? I am a Slytherin, and I chose Slytherin. My Black family has been Slytherins for generations. Are you jealous?"

"Hmph, I thought you would be with Potter. Weren't you two getting along well on the train?" Severus raised his eyebrows and retaliated in the tone that Sirius had used just now. After he finished speaking, he shifted his gaze and looked directly at the students who continued to be sorted.

"Aha, you said I'm a Gryffindor, aren't you the same as me?" Sirius thought he had caught the trick and laughed out loud. He suddenly felt that he seemed to have chosen the right college. It was completely different from what he had imagined at the beginning and it was still very interesting.

"The combined power of these two idiots has such a wide range that even Merlin couldn't stand it, let alone weak little people like us." Severus didn't even look at Sirius and mocked him directly.

"…What does idiot mean?" Sirius was a little confused. He had been studying aristocratic courses since he was a child, and what he was exposed to were all those elegant and malicious sarcasm. So far, he had never seen such a straightforward word…

Severus turned his head speechlessly and glanced at Sirius who was asking for advice seriously. He was so impatient. This Black seemed to have a problem with his brain. He didn't know what potion could cure it... but he was afraid that he was powerless. It was too cheap to compete with such a person. Severus kept silent, worried that idiocy would be contagious.

The confrontation between the two obviously attracted the attention of other Slytherins, especially Narcissa. She was terrified and then happy, and then she became worried, worried that her unruly brother would cause trouble. You know, it was always easy for Prince to make people unlucky. As the eldest son of Black, if he appeared in an indecent image, Sirius's position as heir would be shaken! But the result was not bad. Although the ending was a bit speechless, it was not bad after all.

Eaton was very interested in someone who could stimulate his always calm Severus, and he was also somewhat relieved. His Severus was just too dull. He had been immersed in various learning jars since he was a child and couldn't get out. Recently, he devoted himself to potions and magic. He didn't have the liveliness of his age. It really made people worry. Ya*wen*romance*shou*fax Sirius, a guy with a big nerve and unconventional cards, was very suitable to be his Severus's bad friend.

"It seems that Blake and your brother have a good relationship." Zabini, who was sitting next to Eton, said with a smile and a teasing tone.

"Humph, Orvel has a very sharp vision." Lucius, who was sitting opposite, snorted coldly, "Prince, your brother is very imposing. I heard that the head of the Prince family loves this grandson very much... It's a good thing that the head of the family is still strong."

Orville's face immediately turned ugly. It wasn't the first time that Lucius had been teasing him, but it was the first time that he had been so sarcastic and mocking, and even involved the inheritance of the Prince family. This was simply a complete break with Prince! What was going on? He had originally speculated that there was something fishy behind the breakup between Malfoy and Prince, but now it seemed that it was impossible. What was going on with Lucius? Zabini secretly observed Eaton, wondering whether he should beg for mercy for his childhood friend.

Unfortunately, Eaton was still quietly holding his chin and waiting for the food to be served, without any reaction to anything around him.

That night, Lucius leaned against the head of the bed, pouting his lips and unconsciously pinching the doll in his hand, his brows slightly wrinkled, which made his delicate face, which had grown a little older, look even more beautiful. Unfortunately, no one appreciated it. After a while, he sighed, crushed the doll a few times, threw it to the end of the bed, jumped off the bed, took out the two-way mirror, hesitated for a while, and then input the magic call.

"Eaton...um, today..." Lucius didn't know how to apologize. No matter what, he really went too far today. However, the Dark Lord, whose mood had become abnormally volatile last holiday, became more and more suspicious of his father, so he had to do this.

"Malfoy, has your magic been exhausted so that you can't see the present time?" The look of the little kid that impressed Lucius unexpectedly appeared in the two-way mirror, with a profound accusation in his eyes.

"...Ah, it's Mr. Snape, long time no see." Lucius silently adjusted the two-way mirror so that the messy hair and clothes would not appear in the two-way mirror, and adjusted his expression.

"You have to choose a time for greetings, Mr. Malfoy." Severus had naturally heard about what happened today, but Eaton had already told him about some of the arrangements of Prince's house, so it wouldn't cause him to feel disgusted. "Just because Malfoy is willing to drink toad slime doesn't mean Prince is willing to do so."

Ugh... This was Lucius's intuitive reaction. Could you please not make beauty potions sound so disgusting...

"Wait, don't hang up." Lucius remembered that he still had something to say. "Well, my father said that he has been feeling haggard and weak recently due to the dry weather. He always wanted to eat some of Honeydukes' new lemon-filled chocolate candies, but he was worried that it would conflict with the beauty potion, so he asked me to ask."

"This requires research." Eaton's head pushed Severus aside and appeared in the two-way mirror. "The problem of ingredient conflict has not been analyzed yet."

"Got it. Well, Eaton, my father brought me a lot of cakes today, including the ones you like. I'll put them in the old place tomorrow." Lucius would never say sorry after all. These two words did not exist in the aristocratic dictionary.

After hanging up the two-way mirror, Eaton laughed at Severus's fixed comments, and put his arm around Severus' shoulders. "The old place is the Room of Requirement."

Severus nodded in understanding, and after Eaton lay down, he left and went back to his dormitory.

Sirius tossed and turned in his dormitory, unable to sleep. Finally, he got up in frustration and snored his hair. He really didn't like the atmosphere of Slytherin. It was roundabout. A sentence needed to be turned around a dozen times before you could understand what it meant. He was fed up with these red tapes. Compared to being straight, he preferred to let himself go with James and the others, saying whatever he wanted to say and doing whatever he wanted. But he finally chose to let himself get stuck in the quagmire. After thinking for a while, he got up and ran out of the dormitory barefoot to stand at the door with Severus Snape written on it. He raised his hand to knock on the door, hesitated for a moment, and put it down again. He had no reason to look for others. He couldn't find others to be upset just because he was upset... This reason didn't make sense even in Gryffindor.

"May I know what Mr. Black's perfect appearance at my door means?" Severus's voice with a strong sense of mockery sounded behind Sirius, which startled him... He really jumped, which made Severus's forehead veins move uncontrollably.

"Why are you behind me?" Sirius patted his chest, "Aren't you in your dormitory?"

"It's obvious that Mr. Black's eyes are not very useful." Severus crossed his arms and looked coldly at Sirius's obvious Gryffindor behavior. He was actually a little surprised that this guy chose to stay in Slytherin. "Now, please tell the insignificant person who was disturbed and couldn't even enter his own dormitory, what do you want to do standing in front of my door?"

"I, I want to chat with you." Black's eyes drifted. Narcissa had just expressed to him her satisfaction with his choice of college, and hinted that she would give him a big gift, and even a gift for Bellatrix who had already graduated, and would write a letter to his parents. Although he understood what she said, he was also really annoyed. When facing Narcissa, he didn't say a word and remained silent. He wanted to find someone to chat with. The first choice was naturally James, but the two were not in the same college. The second choice was naturally this guy who spoke a lot of venom but was rarely straightforward, so he didn't think about the fact that they didn't have much friendship and came...

"I'm sorry, as a normal person, I think what I need now is sleep." Severus was not so kind as to be someone else's venting bucket, "Besides, I don't think we have enough friendship to support the so-called chat."

"I, I'm doubting my choice." Black lowered his head and said in a low voice. He pretended not to hear Severus's refusal, "I don't like it."

"After being taught by the nobles for 11 years, you have learned to doubt your own choices? That's right, a guy with a simple brain structure and well-developed limbs will only doubt himself. In this regard, I don't think I can help you." Severus sneered at Sirius' words. Do you regret it now? What were you doing during the sorting? After making the choice, you said sorry, I made the wrong choice. Can I try again? "Why don't you ask your mother, I'm sorry, I think I made the wrong choice and I shouldn't be born in your belly. Can I try again? If Mr. Black can be retrained, I believe everything can be started over again."

Black stared at Severus's eyes full of sarcasm, where he saw a timid self. He didn't react for a moment, and watched Severus walk past him, open the door and go in, then close the door with a bang. This sound brought Sirius back to his senses. He blinked, thought for a while, and then suddenly realized, turned around and went back to his warm bed. How he understood and what he realized... who knows.

The first day of freshman year is always full of curiosity and excitement, with all kinds of laughter and discussions. James was caught in a traffic jam on the road by Sirius, who insisted on getting next to Severus.

"Sirius, come here." James walked forward and forcibly pulled Sirius into an empty passage. "Didn't you say you were coming to Gryffindor? Why did you change your mind?" James simply ignored the possibility that Sirius had mentioned at the time.

"Does it matter which house I'm in?" Sirius grabbed James' shoulder, imitating what James had done before. "It won't prevent us from getting along. Don't worry. Although I'm in Slytherin, my heart is in Gryffindor. I'm with you guys."

"Ha, I knew it." James smiled, as if a heavy burden had been lifted off his shoulders. "Don't worry, I won't look down on you. Even though you entered that evil Slytherin, I knew you were different."

"Of course." Sirius was a little disgusted with the word 'evil', but his excitement that James could forgive him overwhelmed that slight disgust. "Ah, well, I'll find you after class. I have to go to class now. Oh... Severus must not be waiting for me."

After saying that, he was about to chase after her, but was stopped by James, "Hey, why are you so close to that snotty guy? Don't you know he's my love rival?!"

"Don't worry, I will help you supervise and will never give him the chance to become your love rival. Ha, let's go." Sirius turned back and said a few words of comfort hurriedly, then broke free from James' hand and ran away.

James nodded in satisfaction from behind, "You are worthy of being my brother!"

"Well, James, we have to go to class too!" Pettigrew's head appeared from the corridor entrance, and he said awkwardly,

"Ah, let's go, let's go!" James, who just realized that he also had to go to class, found that there were only a few minutes left, but they didn't even know where the classroom was, and he suddenly became anxious.

When Sirius arrived at the classroom panting, Severus had already sat in the first row comfortingly, and a student was seated next to him. Sirius stood next to the student and put his bag on the table. He looked at the young nobleman silently until he realized something and lowered his gaze and sat in the back. Then he sat next to Severus leisurely, with a smug smile on his face, completely ignoring the ridicule and resentment in the eyes of the Slytherins behind him. At least now Black is still a noble on par with Malfoy, and most people have heard of the rebellion of Black's eldest son, so no one dared to provoke him, but behind the scenes they all despised this guy who had nothing to do with the elegant nobility.

"Severus, why are you walking so fast?" Sirius took a breath and complained.

"I'm not your babysitter, Mr. Black. And, call me Snape." Severus read the book.

"Why are you so unfamiliar, Severus." Sirius shrugged, "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be able to figure it out, and I almost went to find Xiao Zhang." It goes without saying why he was looking for the principal. The transfer to another hospital was a first.

"In that case, please shut up. If you can't control it, I don't mind using other things to help block it." Severus slowly turned the page. This morning when he went to Hogwarts for exercise with Eaton, Eaton mentioned Sirius to him. Otherwise, he would not be in such a good mood to sympathize with this giant monster who was obviously fluttering around.

"Oh, you're still revising something you've already learned?" Sirius couldn't help but say something, but was silenced by Severus's sharp glare...

64 House Startup
"Severus, I found you. Ya*wen*romance*first*release"

Severus and Sirius, who refused to stay with the others, were both stunned, but Severus continued to walk quickly towards the auditorium as if he didn't notice anything, while Sirius moved sideways to stop Lily who was chasing after him.

"Hey, pretty girl, why are you here? Where's James?" Sirius blocked Lily's way wherever she went, looking around behind her and making irresponsible remarks.

"Why are you stopping me?" Lily pinched her waist angrily, her bright green eyes seemed to be spitting fire, "And what does that bad guy have to do with me?"

"Lily, Lily." James really caught up with them from behind, panting. Remus and Pettigrew were panting even harder. "Hey, Sirius, thank you."

"Remus, Pettigrew~" Sirius waved and greeted the two people who were holding their knees and catching their breath behind him, "You're welcome~James."

"Why are you following me? Stop following me." Lily frowned and turned her face away. She had no good feelings towards this guy who always depended on her.

James didn't say anything. He just scratched his head with a silly smile, and then looked at Lily's face, which became even pinker because of her anger. After Lily couldn't stand it anymore and glared at him and turned away, he carefully approached Sirius who was chatting with Remus. After peeking around, he said stealthily, "Sirius, do you want to go out tonight? Aha, my dad told me that there are many secret passages in Hogwarts. We can go out at night without being discovered."

Sirius was surprised by this suggestion and was eager to try, but... "Well, Slytherin is going to choose the head of the group tonight, so we can't leave. Let's do it tomorrow night."

"Alright, then the three of us will go first tonight." James patted Sirius on the shoulder quite straightforwardly, and stopped him, walking towards the auditorium, "Let's go eat."

Narcissa was sitting in the hall, keeping a seat next to him, waiting for her brother to arrive so that she could show their love for each other. Unfortunately, Snape came and her brother still didn't come. This morning, she saw that Sirius was very fond of Snape.

Nep's specialness, but it just happened that they needed to contact the Prince family, and the heir did a very good job in this regard.

"Senior Prince, Junior Snape, hello." Narcissa walked behind Eaton and Severus, watching the two brothers eating in unison, feeling a little embarrassed to interrupt them.

Eaton ate the steak that Severus had cut, and turned around to see the little princess who was always known for her gentleness and cuteness. "What's the matter?"

"I just wanted to ask, because Snape is in the same class with my brother Sirius, I wonder if you have seen him?" Narcissa was still standing there gracefully despite her young age. Opposite her was Lucius Malfoy.

Her family told her about the marriage with Malfoy, and she blushed.

"Sorry, I don't think I have any obligation to watch over Black with his legs spread out." Severus said the same thing to everyone, regardless of gender. Fortunately, he could still control the venom.

Narcissa's face turned even redder, this time with shame and a little anger. No one had ever treated her like this before, so she felt a little aggrieved.

"It's truly gentlemanly of you to treat a lady like this." Lucius said sarcastically, "As a half-blood, you don't even know the most basic etiquette of aristocrats."

"It's better than having a few yellow feathers and pretending to be a peacock." Severus lowered his head and continued to cut the lamb chops seriously without even looking up.

Lucius's face instantly turned from white to red and then to black. He gritted his teeth, and the knife and fork in his hand were squeezed so tightly that his hand was almost deformed. "You dare to insult our Malfoy, I want to duel with you!"

Narcissa stepped forward to appease him when she saw this. "Senior Malfoy, we all know that Snape has a unique personality and his language skills are also very unique. It was not his intention. Why do we have to point our wands at each other over such a small matter? What's more, we are going to have a fight tonight.

It's a prefect's challenge, why should seniors and juniors waste their magic power on it?"

Lucius was impressed by these words. They said that a black man is not bloodless. He felt that Narcissa, who seemed mediocre and gentle before, was very scheming now. It seemed that the method that appeased Bellatrix was not the Black family's idea as he thought, but the yellow-haired girl's own method.

"If you want to duel, you can." Severus handed the plate of cut lamb chops to Eaton's side before responding, "As long as you don't mind ruining your appearance, I don't mind helping you at all."

Lucius threw down the knife and fork in his hand and said, "Okay, I'll inform you of the place and time of the duel, we'll see, huh." After that, he got up and left without even eating. Crabbe and Goyle quickly followed him with a bunch of cakes.

Seeing that there was no hope, Narcissa was about to return to her seat when she saw Sirius passing by Lucius and being held by the shoulder by the Potter child as he walked towards the Gryffindor table. Her mind went blank for a moment.

"Sirius! Why don't you come over for dinner?" Aware of the ridicule from the Slytherins around her, Narcissa suppressed her panic and anger, forced a smile, and quickly walked over to stop Sirius.

"Narcissa? Oh, okay. Let's go, James." Sirius naturally saw Narcissa's anger, and then he realized that he was in Slytherin, not Gryffindor as he had imagined. He suddenly felt a little embarrassed.

After returning to Slytherin, Sirius was forced to sit next to Narcissa and received a whole afternoon of obscure education. Even the gifts he received from various relatives and friends at home could not soothe his frustration.

"It seems that Sirius Black has a good impression of Sev." Eaton was sitting in the library with a dozen silencing spells set up around him. However, he did not immediately enter the research and study state as usual. Instead, he had a teasing mood.

"Humph, strong limbs but a simple mind. I should be glad that he didn't enter Gryffindor." Severus sneered, "But he is indeed much better than those cunning Blacks."

"I heard that the Potter family likes Quidditch very much?" As for Sirius, Eaton did not continue this topic, but changed it.

"This is the tradition of the Gryffindor family. Why are you asking this?" Severus raised his eyebrows. He never knew that Eaton was also interested in the Potter family?

"Nothing, I just think flying is really a good pastime." Eaton turned around and looked at the sky outside the window, smiling... Well, the revenge of the snot monster has not been avenged yet...

Abraxas staggered and struggled and threw himself on the bed. His messy clothes, injured mouth, and still twitching body said it all. He had just been tortured by the Cruciatus Curse for a few minutes. Although it was not long, the long-term pampering made Abraxas not able to bear the pain in his soul. For so long, Tom had always been polite to himself as a senior and friend. But in recent times, Tom's emotions became more and more unstable. Because of a mistake he made long ago, he attacked without any explanation, which immediately tilted the balance that was originally balanced.

"Dobby." Abrak sneered at his own stupidity and stood up abruptly. "Bring me the potion box."

Dobby appeared and immediately cried out in surprise when he saw his master's appearance, covering his mouth tightly with his little hands. It was an elf that was born not long ago, and its fear of its master made it panic. Upon hearing the order, it immediately took out the potion box and carefully placed it on the bedside table.

"Go down." Abrak never had absolute trust in the house elf. After letting it go down, he took out two bottles of healing potion with difficulty and drank them. After recovering a lot of physical strength, he went into the bathroom to wash off the dirt on his body and the shame in his heart.

After leaving the bathroom, Abraxas turned pale and had returned to the elegant Malfoy. Since you are unkind, don't blame him for being unjust. Abraxas was different from others because he was the only one among the Death Eaters who knew Voldemort's true identity. Although Tom's performance was outstanding during school and attracted many people's attention, no one knew that he was a half-blood. Moreover, when he became Voldemort and came back many years later, he had changed too much. If it weren't for the fact that only he, who could be considered a good friend, knew some of Voldemort's actions, and if it weren't for the fact that Dumbledore, who liked to sabotage, spread the news everywhere, no one else would have recognized him.

At this time, Prince Manor also received the news. Salazar himself didn't know much about these sinister fights in peacetime, but he was very interested, so he had been participating in the small meetings between Wharton and Gettler since he came back.

"What's the news?" Wharton put down the staff he was cleaning and said to Getler who came hurriedly.

"This has nothing to do with Britain, but more to do with me." Gettler sat on the sofa and smiled strangely, "Voldemort sent Malfoy to Germany to win over the Saints. He seemed to be particularly obsessed with the wound on Lestrange's body, and somehow found this clue."

Salazar stood at the window and looked outside. "It took that guy so long to find this?"

"Yeah, who asked Lestrange to give such a hint..." Wharton laughed strangely, "Ah, at this time, it is indeed courageous to plan to re-attack the German Saints."

"I heard that Malfoy has been punished." Gettler poured himself a cup of black tea and took a sip. "It seems that Lestrange's status in the Dark Lord has improved a lot."

65 House Split
The Slytherin Common Room became lively again after dinner, because Sirius's arm-in-arm relationship with Gryffindor in the Great Hall made many senior students extremely dissatisfied. Although Narcissa did play some role later, she still could not quell their anger.

"Please wait for the selection of freshmen class leaders. I have something to say." A senior with a ferocious face interrupted the chief. Obviously, he did not take the chief seriously. The new chief seemed to have gotten used to this and did not say much. Instead, he showed a gesture of concession.

Severus sat in the freshman group and observed this person. Combining the information Eaton had sent back to the manor, he matched a face: Antonin Dolohov...

"Slytherin... the world of pure-bloods is what all wizards pursue." Dolohov first spread his arms, raised his face slightly, and praised with an exclamatory tone, "What a beautiful place, what a desirable existence, but why did someone come to break it all, huh? Associating with dirty and lowly bugs, bringing shame to Slytherin!" At this point, his tone was already extremely vicious, and the murderous light in his eyes was extremely obvious.

Sirius hadn't thought of himself at this point. He just felt that this person was disgusting and must be a member of the dark wizard gang. When he realized that everyone in the lounge was staring at him, he slowly reacted and jumped up, "Who are you talking about?!"

"Sirius!" Narcissa frowned slightly and stood up gracefully, reprimanding Sirius. "Are you so rude at home? Senior Dolohov, today's incident was a misunderstanding. Everyone in the wizarding world knows how difficult Potter is. Sirius has been exposed to aristocratic education since he was a child, and etiquette is ingrained in his bones, so it is inevitable that he could not be ruthless. The Black family has always been Slytherin, and everyone knows this. No one can deny the purity and determination of the Black people, but this is not something that can be obtained at birth. Could it be that Senior knew from a young age that Slytherin pursues pure blood?"

After these words, Dolohov, who was originally planning to teach Sirius a lesson, hesitated. It was not that he was moved, but that he had selectively forgotten that the guy who corrupted the Slytherin house spirit was from the pure Black family. That was not a family to be trifled with, especially in front of the Dark Lord. To show temporary satisfaction at this time would be equivalent to blocking his way to act recklessly in the future, which was not a good deal.

"Hmph, for Narcissa's sake, we will let him go for now, but if we see him again next time, we won't be so easy to deal with." Dolohov raised his head and threatened, "Anyone who insults Slytherin, don't blame me for being ruthless."

Eaton paused while flipping through the book, then slowly spoke, "Senior, you are so arrogant. May I ask, did Slytherin choose you as the heir, or appointed you as the spokesperson? Don't be so rude. It's your own business to do what you want. Don't use the Slytherin name as a sign." After all, he is also a Slytherin contractor. Now, under normal circumstances, all students in the academy are under his jurisdiction. The entire Slytherin area, including the Black Lake and most of the Forbidden Forest, is under the management of Slytherin. If there are any problems in the future, they will be attributed to him. This guy keeps talking about Slytherin. How has Slytherin got in your way? !

Eaton's words made the entire lounge silent. Over the past two years, Eaton Prince's silence and absence have been deeply rooted in people's hearts. Although many people have taken the initiative to get close to Eaton, they cannot get information, cannot make friends, and cannot test him. Everything has been rejected. Although he is a very piercing person, he has never hurt anyone. Even if those people have provoked and tested him in various ways, they will only fight back after that time and then nothing will happen. It's just "I won't offend others unless they offend me." Absolute neutrality. After a long time, no one is willing to cause trouble for themselves... Who would have thought that he would take the initiative to cause trouble this time...

"Prince, what do you mean by this?" Dolohov, who was about to return to his seat, suddenly became furious and pointed his head at Eaton, "Why, Prince, do you think what I said is wrong? Or is pure blood not what Prince pursues?" As he said this, he looked meaningfully at Severus in the freshman area. Everyone knew that this grandson of Prince was a half-blood, and he didn't cause trouble only because he was worried about affecting the Dark Lord's plan.

"The meaning is simple, just as it says." Eaton snapped the book shut. "Before you talk, please read the Slytherin House Rules. If nothing unexpected happens, I believe you will gain something. Don't blame me for not reminding you that Slytherin has its own rules. Don't think of adding some messy things yourself, unless... you can also claim that you are a descendant of Slytherin."

These words made at least half of the senior students stand up and stare at Eton. They were all students who had decided to follow Voldemort, who was at the peak of his power. They had already met Voldemort and surrendered to his ideal world and personal charm. They would not tolerate others making fun of their king.

Seeing this, Severus walked to Eaton with a cold face. This time he did not stand in front of Eaton, but stood parallel to him. Following him came the heir of the Black family who deeply admired Eaton and decided to support him.

"Prince, you must be responsible for your words." Dolohov drew out his wand and grinned, "Someone has to pay the price for this."

"Oh, you're angry already?" Eaton raised his eyebrows and threw down the book in his hand. "I heard that the Muggle world has been very uneasy recently, with various explosions, dismemberment and murders happening frequently. I don't know who is so tasteless. They claim to be noble and elegant, but prefer all kinds of dirty, messy and disgusting things. It's really puzzling."

"Crucia!" A beam of light shot straight towards Eaton from Dolohov's wand. Unexpectedly, neither Severus nor Eaton made any move, and the light disappeared silently, which surprised everyone present.

"Don't worry, I haven't gotten to the point yet." Eaton said expressionlessly, in a teasing voice, "What's even more surprising is that the nobles who usually hold their chins high, look arrogant and superior, prefer to sign slave contracts and become lifelong slaves of others and think they are happy. This is really a good topic. Maybe we can let Wizard Weekly publish it, which will definitely make us common people look at it with new eyes."

…The malicious anger turned blank…

"What are you talking about?!" Dolohov was stunned for a moment, then he reacted immediately and cast another curse, and disappeared without a trace when he was close to Eaton. "Humph, you want to sow discord? It seems that the Prince family has probably already joined forces with those Muggle-borns?"

Lucius had been sitting in his position as the third grade head student and had not stood up. He was very glad that he had not followed the crowd, because the news made him hold the chair tightly with his hands. Fortunately, while he was sitting, no one would deliberately observe his look and expression.

"We, the Prince family, have been upholding the will of Slytherin since the time of Merlin. Oh, it wasn't called that name back then. What disappoints you is that this will is really not what you said it was. So there's nothing I can do. I also want to support you. Who made you so disappointing? Since Merlin, any wizard who would be willing to offer himself to be slaughtered would have died long ago. Such courage, such dedication, and such selflessness, very few wizards can possess all of these." Eaton suddenly changed his expressionless face. His smile was particularly gentle. His apology was just right and his praise was vivid.

"You, will be smashed to pieces! Your heart and bones will be dug out!" Dolokhov was at a loss for words, but he knew that he must not continue speaking, otherwise it would cause certain losses to the lord.

"Don't bother, you can't hurt me." Eaton stretched lazily, "Don't you know about the awakening of Hogwarts? It's really troublesome to want to hurt someone here." In fact, in Slytherin, the contracted person can hurt others at any time, and others can hurt the contracted person at any time. Well, after all, there are some benefits to signing a contract, at least you can ask the magical creatures who rent the forbidden forest for accommodation fees at any time.

"Prince, are you trying to break our neutrality?" Lucius saw that the seniors began to put down their wands and walked towards Eton, as if ready for a fight. He immediately stood up and spoke righteously. Seeing that they stopped, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief. "You should have evidence when you speak. Slytherin's advocacy of pure blood started with the great Salazar Slytherin. We have our own ideals. Since our ideals are different, our paths are naturally different. We should be neutral if we are to be neutral. We are not going to ridicule your cowardice and incompetence. Are you going to make us your enemy now by talking nonsense?"

When he said the word "completely", Lucius emphasized his tone. He wanted to remind Eaton not to trigger a group reaction, otherwise the two Princes would have a hard time. Although there was a potion, it was not a panacea. He saw the madness of these people last holiday. Although he didn't know what happened to the Muggle in the end, the so-called feast gave Lucius nightmares for many days before it turned around. Fortunately, because he was young, he didn't need to take action. When his father came back from going out and found out that someone had taken Lucius to participate in such an activity, he immediately closed the door and asked Lucius to learn the Platinum House Rules again.

"Don't talk about Salazar, he will kill you." Severus spoke suddenly. Salazar Slytherin was a man with a strong nature and extremely strong attack power. After all, it was a life-and-death situation thousands of years ago. If he didn't kill others, others would kill him. When killing became a habit, it would be too difficult to get him to correct it. The innocent side of that man would only be left to the people he recognized.

"What do you mean?" Lucius immediately realized something was wrong and asked back.

66 House of Bloodshed
All the Slytherins present were staring at Severus and Eaton. Only Sirius was puzzled. He was ready to fight just now, why did he stop when he turned around?! He was feeling depressed at this time. It turned out that he needed the comfort of a big fight.

"Who cares what he means? Don't you want to fight? I'm ready to fight you anytime!" This is Sirius' eager voice.

...= =, this was the expression of everyone at that moment, including Narcissa herself.

"Hey, what are you looking at with those faces? Are you looking down on me?!" Sirius's beast instinct took over and he got angry.

"Ahem, what I mean is..." Eaton coughed, interrupting everyone's gaze on Sirius. This kind of instinctive talent is definitely suitable to be friends with Severus, and he must not be defeated here. "What I said just now was just a joke." At this time, Eaton had recovered from his facial paralysis and spoke seriously.

“……”Silence.

"You're dead, Prince." Dolohov's face was gloomy, his body tensed.

"Oh, you can't take a joke?" Eaton raised his eyebrows, "Are you a Slytherin or not... Hey, have you heard?"

"What?" Dolokhov answered instinctively.

"I heard that a handsome guy with red eyes appeared in the magic world. Although only a few people saw it, the story has been widely circulated, but it has not been confirmed whether it is true or not. With the foundation of the Prince family, I assure you that this story is true. Considering that I provided you with such important information, forget the joke..." Eaton said very seriously, "Oh, by the way, as for why you can't beat us, believe me, every family has a few precious heirlooms, what do you think?"

"Prince, do you think this is the end?" Dolohov's face was green for a long time. His brain was not so logical, so he could not understand the impact of Eaton's words. He thought it was obviously a provocation to him. However, if he reported this information to the Lord, he would definitely get a reward. Maybe he could be the first to join the Death Eaters. Hmm... Actually, this deal is quite worthwhile. "Don't joke around, Prince. I'll let you go this time. If there is a next time, don't blame me for being ruthless." He really didn't want to let this guy go, but if the spell was ineffective, he had no choice. He would talk about it after he figured out what the heirloom was!

Lucius took a special look at Severus's expression. Although he was impressed by this ruthless junior, he didn't know much about his true nature. He didn't know what kind of person Severus was. He just instinctively wanted to know the meaning of the words just now... Could it be that Salazar Slytherin is still alive? !

In fact, Lucius's inner thoughts were the same as most Slytherins. They were all entangled in the slave contract and Salazar's affairs. For a moment, his brain was in a mess. The only thing he wanted to do was to contact his family as soon as possible to let them confirm what was going on. Everyone knew that the Prince family was good at potions and alchemy. No one knew how many family collections had been passed down since the time of Merlin. In everything, it is better to be safe than sorry...

"In that case, everyone please sit down. The freshman class leader has not been chosen yet. What do you think?" Narcissa secretly pulled her stupid brother to her side, thinking about how to communicate with her family and tell Sirius' parents about their current situation. Humph, you want to provoke the Black family, but you don't even consider your own weight. Of course, Prince's words should also be revealed in a subtle way.

"Everyone, please return to your positions." The chief finally came out to make plans. "The freshman prefect challenge begins now."

Severus returned to his seat. He did not intend to participate in the selection of prefects. Please, he was busy with his own things and had no time to care about these guys.

"Severus, aren't you going to go up?" Sirius asked, sneaking up to Severus. "Well, in a place like this, this position is not easy to earn."

Severus couldn't help but turn his head to look at Sirius who was very disdainful, and then looked at Eaton. After the two exchanged glances, Severus decisively pulled Sirius up and pushed him to the center of the venue, "If you can't get the prefect, don't come down."

"..." Sirius was dumbfounded. Narcissa was so relieved. "S-Severus, what are you doing?"

Severus was silent. Just now, so many Slytherins had been causing trouble for Eton, and he was going to make those people uncomfortable. A Slytherin with Gryffindor traits becoming a prefect would definitely cause aggrieved people who were proud of their pure blood. It was a pity that the Black family was not so easy to mess with. No matter how uncomfortable they were, the most they could do was attack from behind. Well, he would help them then.

Looking at Severus's expression, Sirius also caught a glimpse of Dolohov's gloomy face and the frustrated expressions of many people, and suddenly realized, "Don't worry, Severus, the prefect is no problem. Everyone, we have all met at the Black family's banquet, right?" After saying that, he performed a standard noble salute,

Severus expressed satisfaction with Sirius's comprehension ability. The courses for the Black family heirs have always been the most rigorous. As a family of dark magic, the magic they have studied since childhood is extremely lethal. Everyone is very clear about this, so the expressions of the freshmen on the field are very solemn.

The next thing was simple. Whether it was magic or physical combat, no one could defeat Sirius. The chief had no choice but to announce Sirius as this class's class leader. At that moment, Dolohov and several senior students expressed their extreme dissatisfaction, but the school rules could not be changed.

Narcissa stood up gracefully, and walked to Sirius who was talking to Severus excitedly with a decent smile. She also glanced at Dolohov and others in the middle of the conversation, and her meaning was self-evident. She took out a handkerchief and wiped the dust off Sirius considerately, "Uncle and aunt will be very happy. Haven't you always wanted a manor? This time you have it." Although Narcissa's tone was teasing, the arrogance in it was quite obvious. She just wanted to let everyone know the prominence of the Black family. "Hasn't Regulus always been nagging you to write letters every day? Later, your sister will give you a pair of two-way mirrors, so that people at home don't worry about you."

Speaking of Regulus, Sirius frowned, looking a little nervous. This younger brother of his was good, but he was too clingy to him.

"Okay, Narcissa, in front of so many people." Sirius muttered.

"What's the big deal? Look at you. You are the future owner of the Black family." Narcissa said angrily, "In the future, the entire Black family will be yours, and you are embarrassed now."

I just don't want to inherit the Black family, so I'm like this... Sirius's excitement just now was suddenly weighed down by a huge stone, and his expression became gloomy. Why does Narcissa always bring up things that are not related to the topic...

Soon, everyone dispersed. Dolohov kept staring at Sirius and Narcissa, his eyes like a venomous snake. When most people had left, he approached them and said, "What would happen if I told the Lord that the heir of the Black family was hanging out with Gryffindor and communicating with the Mudbloods?"

Narcissa stopped Sirius from acting impulsive and smiled gently, "Senior, you can go and give it a try. I wonder if the lord will trust a small family that can't even get the middle-level nobles, or will he trust his most trusted subordinates? Oh, I forgot, it seems that senior has difficulty meeting the lord. What a pity. The lord just said that he would come to visit the Black family at Christmas. What do you think would happen if the uncle accidentally told the lord about someone who committed treason? You know, this is what the lord hates the most." After saying this, she smiled even sweeter.

Dolohov's face turned dark instantly. After a long time, he finally suppressed the anger and panic in his heart. "...I was joking. Why are you so serious? I have always admired Blake but have no chance to meet him. So I come here to make a name for myself, haha." At the end, he even laughed stiffly twice, which made Sirius burst out laughing.

Narcissa secretly pinched Sirius and said, "Of course, senior, no one would take a joke seriously. Sirius was just talking to the Gryffindors and making a few jokes. There's nothing to take seriously, right?"

"Of course, the entire wizarding world is well aware of how difficult the Potter family is." Dolohov had not yet mastered his skills, and after saying this, he finally couldn't help but turn around and leave.

Narcissa heaved a sigh of relief and turned to talk to Sirius. She saw Severus and Eaton sitting on the sofa calmly, and Lucius was also watching everything with appreciation on the single sofa. Noticing Lucius's eyes, Narcissa blushed instantly.

Clap, clap, clap...Lucius clapped his hands a few times. "This is brilliant."

Narcissa's heart couldn't help but beat a few more times, and she said shyly, "Thank you for the compliment, Senior Malfoy. For my family, I must spare no effort." One of the rules of the Malfoy family is to put family at the center.

"Severus, how is it? Did I perform well?" Sirius rushed to the side of Severus' sofa, acting like a little animal asking for praise.

"Don't act like a narcissistic peacock." Severus glanced at Lucius, "Did Black only teach you to be complacent?"

"Of course not. I beat them to a pulp every year." Sirius understood without any surprise, which drew the attention of Lucius and Narcissa. It seemed that Severus' venom had no effect on Sirius at all? !

"It's late, time to rest." Eaton stood up. Today's mission was over. Everything depended on tomorrow's results. Now it was time to inform Grandpa and Salazar to get ready. Appropriate activities were really good for physical and mental health. The terrorist attacks in the Muggle world continued to increase, which was not a good thing.

Sirius also wanted to leave, but Narcissa grabbed his wrist and prevented him from leaving. After Lucius disappeared at the entrance of the corridor, Narcissa's face finally got rid of her shyness. She set up various spells around to make sure that no one could hear their conversation.

"Sirius, let's have a good talk." Narcissa's face was solemn.

Severus followed Eaton into his room and hugged Eaton from behind without saying a word. He was silent for a long time before he said sullenly, "Tell me before you do anything dangerous."

Eaton thought it was something else, and broke free from Severus' arms, looked into his worried black eyes, and reached out to ruffle Severus' soft hair, "Grow up quickly, Severus."

It was just a joke, but Severus nodded seriously, leaving Eaton speechless.

"Our Severus considers Sirius a friend, which is rare." Eaton didn't want to continue this topic, so he decisively changed it.

Severus frowned uncomfortably, "That idiot, who considers him a friend? It's not like my brain is occupied by a troll."

"That's not how your performance says it is, eh?" Eaton joked. "That's good. I feel relieved."

...Don't you think you are being ridiculous when you say this...

"Do you want to leave me alone?" Severus was immediately alert, with vigilance flashing in his eyes. He had previously joined forces with everyone in his family, including Salazar, to use the reason that the contractors had to stay in school to get Eaton to give up his plan to leave school in two years. What did he mean by saying this now?

"Severus, you are an independent individual. You can't stay with me forever." Eaton felt that since they had decided to let nature take its course, the two of them would either become lovers or have a simple relationship. No matter which one it was, he hoped that Severus could have his own circle of life so that he could truly realize his feelings.

"Eton Prince!" Severus was angry. His voice was still low, but it was filled with deep sorrow. "Since you wanted to abandon me, you shouldn't have taken me away in the first place! Can't you just let me die on my own? What am I? Huh? Trash that can be discarded at any time, or waste that can be thrown away after use. Doesn't that make me a useful person? What are my efforts over the years? What am I in your eyes?! You can ignore me and then ignore me for months. Do you know me? Oh, maybe I should ask, have you ever seen me?"

67 House Cold War
Looking at the sad Severus in front of him, Eaton couldn't help but think of the first time they met. Even though he was lying on the cold ground with wounds all over his body, his expression was not sad at all, as if he was looking forward to accepting death. From then until now, Severus has been trying hard. This is the first time he has seen Severus so sad. Somehow, he felt very painful in his heart, but he couldn't say a word.

Severus had been waiting for Eaton's answer, but what he got was a long silence, which made his heart suddenly escape into darkness. However, he couldn't help but laugh sadly, "It seems I was right? Good night, my cousin."

Severus turned around and left resolutely. He did not see Eaton trying to hold his raised hand, nor did he see the expression on his usually expressionless face after the door was closed. Perhaps Severus was right. He had always been too self-centered and never asked others. Eaton stood in the center of the bedroom for a long time, and finally had to reach out and cover his eyes. He liked to stay in a familiar place all the time. He liked to immerse himself in his own world. He did not like others to invade his life. Even his life and death partners avoided his territory. He did not like strangers. He hated talking to others and hated others guessing his thoughts. He hated crowded places. He did not believe that there was any emotion in this world... All this was just because he was still afraid of everyone, he was afraid of this world. Severus was right, but the target was wrong. He just put himself in the position of discarded garbage and waste that was thrown away after use and could not get down... Damn Severus, why did you have to cut open his wound...

That night, Eaton returned to Prince Manor, but did not disturb anyone. He sat on the top of the back mountain, holding a wild civet cat and looking at the stars in the sky until dawn.

In the next few days, Slytherin became unusually quiet and did not have any conflicts with Gryffindor. Even if Gryffindor provoked it to the extreme, at most it would receive some cold stares and some elegantly worded sarcasm and ridicule. There was not a single fight. The whole Slytherin seemed serious but listless, which aroused Dumbledore's sufficient vigilance. He was worried that Voldemort had a new conspiracy while venting his anger on the Muggles and provoking a war. However, this time he had convenient conditions. James mentioned a lot of Sirius to him. For this, he observed and understood this heir who grew up from a family of dark magic from many aspects. In the end, he was very pleased. However, in order to ensure Sirius's position in Slytherin, he secretly notified James to bring Sirius to the principal's office for a chat.

The fact that Sirius was interviewed by Dumbledore did not attract the attention of the Slytherins. On the contrary, the Prince brothers, who were always so close to each other, fell into a cold war and received most sidelong glances.

"Hey, how many days has it been?" A ladylike girl sat in the lounge and pretended to wipe her mouth with a handkerchief...

"Five days, six hours, twenty-three minutes, and five seconds. No, it's six seconds now." A long-haired girl was writing on parchment carefully, and her fingers tapped her face involuntarily as she thought deeply.

"It's a break, huh? A half-blood can make the head of the Prince family admit that he is blessed by Merlin, and still dream of getting the recognition of the heir?" A girl in a skirt lowered her voice while looking at her face in the mirror with disdain.

"What are you discussing, dear ladies?" A cold and slightly arrogant voice sounded in its characteristic tone, followed by Lucius' handsome face with slightly longer hair and a slender figure for his age.

"Oh, Senior Malfoy." The three second-year girls who had gathered together immediately stood up and greeted Senior Malfoy with blushing faces. They were all children from small families and had longed for the handsome and wealthy Malfoy family. If they could successfully become the hostess of the Malfoy family, it would be the happiest thing! !

"We didn't discuss anything. It's just that the relationship between Senior Prince and Junior Snape seems to have become strained recently. We are just worried." The girl who was looking in the mirror secretly put the mirror into her sleeve and explained shyly.

Lucius walked up to the girl and slowly scanned her face until she turned her head away more shyly. Then he reached out and gently pinched the girl's chin. Amid the exclamations of the other two girls, he turned the girl's face to face him, "What a pretty face, exquisite makeup, exactly my type..." Seeing the surprise in her eyes, Lucius couldn't help but curl his lips, "It's a pity... I don't like girls who lie to me."

After saying that, he let go of her hand, took out his handkerchief and wiped the fingers he had just touched one by one, then threw it away, turned around and took Goyle and Crabbe out of the lounge, leaving behind the girl who was so pale with disbelief, and the other two "companions" who looked regretful but could not hide their gloating.

The others in the lounge sneered at this scene. It seemed that there were more than one or two Slytherins who didn't know what was good for them. However, as to why Malfoy would help three worthless low-ranking nobles, they simply attributed it to Malfoy's ability to play both sides and left it alone. They didn't have the energy to think deeply about such things. Therefore, they missed the opportunity to see Malfoy clearly.

Goyle and Carab were winking at each other nervously, not understanding why Malfoy suddenly got so angry.

"Um, Lucius, where are we going now?" Goyle asked uneasily while looking at the figure in front of him. He failed to brake in time and hit Lucius who suddenly stopped, and immediately took a step back.

"Go find my dear junior!" Lucius answered with gritted teeth after many seconds. This time his tone completely frightened Goyle and Crabbe, causing them to shrink their necks involuntarily and obediently follow Lucius who started walking again. The two slowly had to jog to keep up with his speed.

"You two, who told you to follow me?" Lucius turned around and yelled at the two guys who braked quickly.

"Uh... let's go then." Crabbe pushed Goyle hard, "Hurry up, hurry up!" The two men pushed and shoved each other and ran away.

Well, Lucius admitted that his temper was a bit inexplicable, but he had to understand his eagerness to get answers to those "jokes"! But!! Because the two guys have been in a cold war until now, Eaton has never responded to the two-way mirror! There is no one in the dormitory every night, and no one knows where they go. It's really... He is indeed a little worried about his friend... and the black-haired and black-eyed little kid who left a very deep impression on him.

It was easy for Lucius to avoid the current Slytherin. When he found Severus, who was behaving more strangely, he was sitting under a tree next to the Black Lake, with a very thick book spread out on his legs, his eyes fixed on the shimmering surface of the Black Lake, as if he would not blink unless he saw something.

"Good afternoon, dear junior." Lucius blocked Severus' sight, looking down at him and mocking him.

Severus came to his senses. He had already set up a Silencing Charm and an Ignoring Charm around him, so he didn't hear what Lucius said, but he knew from his expression that it wasn't a good thing. Severus closed the book, stood up, and lifted the Silencing Charm. "It seems that I am really shortsighted. I actually disturbed the senior's silence. I'm sorry." Severus' voice tablet was like a machine,

Lucius's expression stiffened for a moment. "I am here to kindly warn you that a person has the right to choose his own life, to be frank or cowardly. Whether you want to be a wretched villain or a qualified Slytherin, it is naturally inconvenient for us to participate. But before that, as a Slytherin student, please read the Slytherin House Rules." Slytherins never get themselves into the mud, so don't just let your temper do what you want, bastard! Humph, if you are a doll... I can't crush you to death.

"I know the Slytherin house rules by heart, so it's not up to Prefect Malfoy to worry about them." Severus said in the same tone, without changing his expression.

"That would be great." Lucius beat the black-clad villain in his heart. "Oh, by the way, as the head of the third grade, I am very troubled by the fact that Eton Prince is absent from many classes. But I can't find him after many attempts to contact him. This is hard to explain. Could it be that Hogwarts has become the Prince family's business?"

Speaking of Eton, Severus immediately changed his tone, his eyes became particularly sharp, "Mr. Malfoy, what do you mean by difficult to explain? May I ask who you want to explain to?"

...Is this really all you noticed? "This is a third-year matter, don't worry about it, junior." Lucius gritted his teeth and remained indifferent and arrogant.

"In that case, put away your peacock feathers and mind your own business. If you want to meddle, apply for transfer to Hufflepuff first!" Severus' voice became as low and smooth as a venomous snake, hissing.

"Also, if you need to report to the prefect to apply for exemption, I'm going to ask Slughorn if the dean can retire and be replaced by a strange peacock with Hufflepuff nature." Severus turned around and walked a few steps without looking back. He was still worried that those guys would say something to Eton...

He was obviously worried to death, why was he pretending to be so cool and not willing to take the initiative! Lucius was jealous. He always saw Eden comforting the angry Severus. Lucius, who had never seen Severus comfort Eden, said that this little guy was more awkward than any other Slytherin. ...By the way, could the book in Severus's hand be the only copy of "Hogwarts Behind the Curtain" that was treasured in Hogwarts?
68 House of Lion Ancestor
Severus didn't walk far, but stopped at a place where Lucius couldn't see him. In fact, the moment he came out of Eaton's room that day, he regretted it. He knew Eaton's idea clearly, but it was just to let him learn to integrate with other people and make him less lonely. All the ideas were based on his own good. Even his grandfather and Gettler came to talk to him about Eaton's affairs, and even told him everything about the death of Eaton's parents. He knew that Eaton had a wound in his heart, but he couldn't stand Eaton always pushing him out. His favorite thing in his life was to make potions with Eaton, and the most exciting thing in his life was to break into the Hogwarts underground magic circle like a Gryffindor with Eaton under unknown circumstances. What he wanted most in his life was to be with Eaton all the time, and what he expected most in his life was to always be by Eaton's side. For such a person, why did Eaton always refuse to accept him into his territory? He was also anxious, but as Salazar said, Eaton was a person who would never open his heart if you didn't force him!

Severus sighed and found a lush tree to sit down again. He couldn't convince himself to compromise with Eton. Everything could be compromised, but not this one, never. Suppressing the bitterness and sadness in his heart, as well as a little worry, Severus reopened the book. This book was what Eton had mentioned. When he missed Eton, he exchanged a bottle of expensive wine for Professor Slughorn's note and borrowed the book.

The face in the book no longer roared in three dimensions. After Eaton's merciless beating, he had learned his lesson. At this moment, he was looking at the boy in front of him with his rolling eyes. Hmm, was my book so boring?! His eyes were empty...

"Hey, kid, pay attention." His face seemed to want to play the role of a professor who was urging him to do something.

Severus came back to his senses and frowned at the face protruding from the book, "Since you have degenerated to the point where only your face is left, just focus on your painting."

"Good intentions are not rewarded. If it weren't for your kindness, I wouldn't bother to tell you." He rolled his eyes, "Well...since you are so kind, I want to ask you for a favor."

"I never knew an illustration could have this function?" Severus picked up the book and looked it over from top to bottom, flipping through a few pages. His face appeared on the page he turned to without any hindrance. "Who are you?"

"Kid, be polite! I was the one who asked you for a favor first!" Face cleared his throat, "You look a lot like the last kid who borrowed books. Can you help me find him?"

The last one... was Eton. Severus narrowed his eyes slightly, slowly raised the book in his hand to face himself, "I have no obligation to do this... But if you can tell me why you are looking for him, maybe I don't mind helping you with this?"

Face didn't seem to care about keeping secrets, "I need his help with something. Last time, because of him, I saw someone I cared about very much. Well, I don't know why I care so much, but I know I have to find him."

Looking for someone? Severus quickly filtered through the people and events Eaton had seen during his two years at Hogwarts. This book was at least a thousand years old, so the people he was looking for would definitely not be the current ones. He also thought about the fact that Eaton had borrowed this book to study when he rescued Salazar. At the same time, the nobleman in the portrait...

Thinking of this, Severus closed the book in his hand regardless of the objection, quickly stood up and returned to the castle. At the door of the lounge, when no one was around, he turned his face to the noble in the portrait and asked, "Is he the one you are looking for?"

He hesitated for a while, then answered firmly, "No, but this dress is very familiar, and the book in my hand is also familiar."

Severus didn't know whether he should be relieved or not. He had a vague guess in his mind that the person this face was looking for was probably Salazar Slytherin. Of course, this statement horrified him. He was considering whether to return the book immediately and let it be completely silent.

"Severus, what are you doing?" Sirius's voice rang out from behind Severus, "Wow, you can actually read such a thick book?"

"Hey, Severus, let me tell you, I have a small manor! It's right on the border of England, and there's no one else there except the house-elves. Let's go there to play during the holidays! We can play whatever we want, however we want." Seeing that Severus didn't say anything, Sirius dropped the topic. Anyway, he didn't want to get any answer from him.

"Are you really from the Black family?" Severus asked coldly.

"…Why are you trying to discourage me…" Sirius paused for a moment, feeling a little discouraged. "Isn't it because you think I don't look like a noble? I don't even want to be one. Besides, who says that nobles must wear bright clothes, behave elegantly, act precisely, and speak arrogantly…James is also a noble."

James, Remus, and Pettigrew were poking their heads out from the fork in the corridor. They probably didn't want to get close to Slytherin. But when James saw Sirius chatting with Severus, he got mad. Lily always talked about Severus and put her whole heart on this half-blood! She ignored him. Is this fair?! That gloomy boy was not as handsome and sunny as him! No, he had to let Lily know who was the best!

"Remus, Pettigrew, let's do this for a while..." James rolled his eyes and came up with a plan. He planned to make Severus look bad, so that Lily could see the uselessness of this half-blood.

"James, Snape has no grudge against us, is it necessary to do this?" Remus was the first to object. He was still thinking about asking the Prince brothers to help him. How could he offend someone like this? If so, that person would be completely offended! Forget about the antidote for wolfsbane, I'm afraid the poison would be used directly.

"That's right, James, this isn't a good idea..." Pettigrew still remembered Eton's politeness to him, and he had a good impression of the brothers. Besides, they were not evil Slytherins, they were both well-known for their neutrality in the wizarding world.

"Why are you so weak? He is a Slytherin and we are Gryffindors, what's wrong with that? Didn't those Slytherins fight with us last time? Are you still brave Gryffindors?" James yelled angrily.

Severus easily caught the sudden roar in Slytherin, the quietest place among the four colleges. He sneered and looked at Sirius with sarcasm in his eyes, "Yeah, you can also learn from him and discuss with others behind my back how to make trouble for me, how to start a group fight, and how to become a brave Gryffindor. You noble, you really make me look at you in a new light." After that, he gave the command and entered the lounge.

Sirius stood at the door of the lounge in some embarrassment, blaming James in his heart. He knew that this was Slytherin, and that he and Severus were standing here. He had even told him about his friendship with Severus a long time ago, so why did he have to cause trouble and even yell so loudly for the person involved to hear!

When they returned to the Gryffindor trio, James and the others had already finished the negotiations. Seeing Sirius coming back, they all stepped forward to greet him, "Let's go to the Quidditch field. I asked my dad to talk to the professor so we can borrow a few brooms. By the way, isn't Snape here?"

Sirius couldn't tell what he felt now, "He's not interested, let's go." After saying that, he took the lead and walked in front so that the other three could not see his expression.

James was immediately excited when he heard that they were not interested. He had already found out that Prince's family had never been good at Quidditch. Didn't Prince apply for exemption? Haha, he finally found a breakthrough. Even if Remus and Pettigrew didn't help him, he could still let Lily see the ugly side of this guy!

That night, Eaton sat on the top of the mountain as usual. He hadn't slept for many days and took energy potions to replenish his strength every day. He had been avoiding Severus these days. Although he was in the college and lived in a lounge, he had never seen him once. Except for the necessary classes, Eaton stayed in the Ravenclaw library during the day and returned to Prince Manor to watch the stars at night.

"How many days has it been? Aren't you tired of watching it all the time?" A voice with a hint of curiosity and concern sounded behind Eaton.

"Salazar, sit down." Eaton stroked the fat lizard in his arms and said lightly,

Salazar did not shy away from it. He sat on the ground and looked at the little lizard that was trembling because it sensed his bloodline. He reached out his hand and stroked it twice with ill intentions, feeling its body instantly stiffen like stone. "You always come back. Aren't you afraid that Wharton and the others will find out?"

"No one else will find it except you." Eaton put the lizard directly into Salazar's arms, ignoring the pleading look in his eyes.

"Are you so sure that boy won't tell them?" Salazar curled his lips, threw away the lizard in disgust, and watched the other party instantly scurried into the bushes and disappeared. "That's right, with that boy's temper, I'm afraid he will follow you even if you want to destroy the magic world."

Eaton ignored the topic and looked back at the starry sky. "Have you figured out anything about the soul in the book I mentioned to you before?"

"I like to cut up souls and put too many everywhere. I can't find them all." Salazar didn't actually check. He didn't care about the souls in books at all. Although it was the first time for him to put souls in books. "Why bother about that? It's interesting, but it's unnecessary."

"You can ignore other books, but wasn't Hogwarts Behind the Darkness written by the four of you?" Eaton was puzzled by Salazar's attitude. It's not cold, nor indifferent. In short, he was completely cold about this matter, without any proper attitude. "Don't you think the soul in it should be someone you know?"

"I don't care about people I know." Salazar's wine-red eyes looked even deeper and colder at night. "Everything is a personal choice."

69 House: The Past
Eaton glanced at Salazar with a slightly cool look in his eyes after hearing this, "It seems you guessed it. Ya*wen*romance*first*release"

Salazar looked a little annoyed, so he just lay down. "Whether I guessed it or not is not the point. Because that is all in the past tense. You are in the present tense. Are you going to sit here until dawn?"

Eaton was silent. After a long time, his voice resounded in the quiet night, "I'm scared."

Salazar sneered and glanced at Eaton. "Slytherin will not be afraid of this kind of emotion. If you want to do it, you do it. If you don't want to do it, you don't do it. No one can resist it. The same goes for feelings."

"Haha, I didn't know you had the hobby of a close sister." Eaton gave a sincere evaluation of Salazar's words, but looking at Salazar, I'm afraid his story is more exciting than everyone else's now. This kind of bold and resolute character is the most enviable.

"I met a person, the person I trusted most in my life, when I was very young." Eaton did not intend to listen to Salazar's answer. Instead, he looked at the starry sky and murmured, "He tolerated me, loved me, and met all my willful demands without scruples, so in the end I chose to believe him. I envied other people's childhoods, so he took me to play all the children's games and do all kinds of childish things. He worked hard and earned money to buy toys and snacks for me, but he was reluctant to eat and wear them. When other children bullied me, he would defend me. That was the warmth I had never felt before, so I thought that after everyone abandoned me, someone who belonged to me finally appeared by my side. Haha, for this, I was ridiculously grateful to the God I never believed in. Unfortunately, in the end, I still couldn't escape the fate of the devil."

"What did he do?" Salazar's tone was cold, icy cold to the bone.

"He just wanted me to voluntarily accept the examination and work for him." Eaton's mood became very calm at this time. After the wound was sealed, he never opened it. "In order to prevent him from suffering so much, I chose to help those who came to me to make more money. It was probably a few years. My hands were stained with a lot of blood. I became extremely disgusted with myself, but seeing him happy, I was also happy. Until one day, I was injured, very seriously. At that time, I thought I was going to die. I guess everyone thought so, so I didn't care about what I said, and I got unexpected information."

"He sent those people." Salazar said confidently. A slight demonic pressure began to rise around him, and the grass around him kept trembling.

"To be exact, it was an accomplice. Seeing that I was dying and useless, they sold me to an underground market that specializes in superpower research." Eaton nodded and lay down with Salazar, looking empty-eyed. "I was dissected. Fortunately, they knew to save my life."

Salazar didn't know what autopsy meant, but that didn't stop him from understanding the bloodiness there. "Come here."

"What?" Eaton looked sideways at Salazar's red eyes, which were filled with tenderness.

Salazar took Eaton's head and pressed it into his arms without question. "I am a powerful dark wizard. I have probably killed more people than Merlin has ever killed, but that doesn't stop me from having feelings. You can cry in my arms so no one can see."

Eaton was immediately at a loss for words. Who is so narcissistic as to call himself a powerful dark wizard? Well, although what he said was true, what about crying in his arms? You must have read too many romance novels! Eaton reached out and pushed Salazar's chest, "Hey, let go, I'm not that fragile."

"You're not that fragile to stay on the top of a mountain for several nights without eating or sleeping, sitting there in a daze?" Salazar expressed strong doubts, holding Eaton's hands tightly, "Don't force me to cast a spell on you."

"What spell are you going to use?" After hearing this, Eaton stopped struggling and leaned calmly on Salazar's chest and asked. Since he could say something that had been sealed in his heart for decades, it proved that he no longer cared and naturally couldn't cry. For him, tears had long been thrown away. Even during the years he stayed in that underground mall and was studied, he didn't shed a single tear.

"Tear-gas spell." Salazar said loudly. How could you underestimate the dark wizards? Such a small matter could be solved with just one spell.

...Oh, I wonder if it has the same effect as tear gas. "Teach me this practical spell later." Eaton nodded, "Well, I'm a little sleepy, just stay here and be my pillow... Good night." After saying this, Eaton's even breathing sounded, and he had fallen asleep soundly.

Salazar carefully cast a few spells around them, and used a leaf to turn it into a blanket to cover the two of them. "No wonder the souls feel so kind." They both came from darkness, were immersed in the underworld, and carefully preserved the only remaining beauty.

"Boy, you are lucky. No one has stayed in my arms for all these years." Salazar childishly stretched out his slender fingers and poked Eaton's face, "Don't worry, with me here, no one dares to bully you. With the current level of the wizarding world, it will be easy for me to take over the entire wizarding world." Humph, if that expressionless boy in black dares to betray you, he will let him thoroughly understand what the sorrow of life and the desire for death are.

Salazar didn't care about the fact that what Eaton said had nothing to do with the eldest grandson of the Prince family. To him, Eaton Prince was the only one he knew, and he didn't care about the others.

At this moment, Severus was sitting on the sofa in the dormitory, looking at the book on the table in deep thought, not knowing that his Eton had already been embraced by someone else (what kind of saying is this...).

The knock on the door interrupted Severus' thoughts. He frowned, stood up and opened the door with a chill. Unexpectedly, there was no one outside the door. However, with many years of experience in fighting saints, he keenly felt that someone had entered his bedroom from beside him, so he closed the door silently and mercilessly cast an Exposing Spell and Expelliarmus at them.

“…Do you have to be so cruel…” Lucius looked at his wand being disarmed in embarrassment. He could only watch helplessly as the weapon fell into his hands… This junior was even more domineering than he had imagined!

"If I remember correctly, it should be your beauty sleep time now, senior." Severus had no intention of returning the wand. Instead, he leisurely walked to the sofa and sat down, squinting his eyes to look at the noble who was still dressed in bright and beautiful clothes. "I am honored to be here. What can I do for you?"

Lucius came back to his senses, pretending that he didn't care where his wand belonged, and sat on the sofa. "Severus, why be so polite? Just call me Lucius."

"If you want to talk about this, please go ahead, senior." Pointing at the door, Severus continued to turn on the air conditioner.

"Severus, at least the guests are here, so you should receive them well." Lucius did not intend to show weakness immediately. After all, he came to deliver information to the Prince family, so he had to entertain them.

"That's fine. Whether you want troll saliva, mud snake venom, or lazy toad mucus, I can satisfy you." Severus naturally knew the purpose of Lucius's visit. He had been in contact with his grandfather and others in the past two days. Although he was expecting his grandfather to mention Eaton in passing, he still put business first.

…Just hearing this makes my stomach hurt. Lucius's eyes flashed with a trace of entanglement and depression, and then he straightened his face, "It's better not to do so. It's late at night, and entertaining is not good for your health. My father came back from Germany today, and he was very happy."

"As long as you are happy." Severus expected this to happen. "Nothing else, I want to rest."

"...Um, Eden is not here, I wonder if you have..." Lucius's eyebrows flashed with a hint of obscurity, and his eyes also flashed with a faint light. "High-quality potion for treating mental trauma, no matter how much it costs."

Hearing this, Severus glanced at Lucius, whose face was gloomy, and got up to take out his potion box from the cabinet beside the bed, took out a few bottles of potion and put them on the table, "Get out."

Lucius said nothing more. He immediately put away the potion, took back his wand and cast the invisibility spell again. He stopped when he reached the door, his tone returning to its arrogant and indifferent tone, "Slytherin has always been about purity. Although Eaton's words caused panic among the Death Eaters, it is said that someone has already reported it to him." In fact, Voldemort had already wiped out a family of Death Eaters with wavering minds last night, and now no one dared to mention it again.

After that, Lucius quietly left the room. He had come to visit Severus late at night to make sure everyone was asleep. For safety reasons, he invited all members of the Death Eater family to drink tea with sleeping potion. He also placed a spell in front of Severus' door to prevent eavesdropping. He quietly lifted it before leaving.

After Lucius left, Severus took out his own two-sided mirror and rubbed it. Finally, he put it down and took his grandfather's pair. He answered the phone, "Lucius was here just now. The head of the Malfoy family should be punished by the Cruciatus Curse again."

"I got it. You and Eaton must be careful at school. Just now, Voldemort personally slaughtered a family of Death Eaters who had not yet betrayed him. I'm afraid that once the Death Eaters are panic-stricken and dare not betray him, he will find an opportunity to attack Eaton. You must stay with Eaton for 24 hours." Wharton's expression was extremely serious. Even if Severus didn't contact him, he would probably contact him soon.

"Okay." Upon hearing that Eaton was in danger, Severus immediately put his own affairs aside.

"Neither of you is safe. If necessary, you can ask Dumbledore for help." In the past two days, Wharton was actually so busy that he had no time to sleep. Voldemort suddenly began to bombard the Prince family's industries in turn. Not only that, anyone who had contact with Prince would be attacked as long as they could be caught. Voldemort had gone crazy and didn't care about anything at all.

"Understood." Severus agreed solemnly.

This time, no one expected Voldemort to be so cruel. Anyone who had a wavering mind would be slaughtered. He had no humanity at all. This would inevitably shake the family and no longer dare to act rashly. They could only obey obediently, no matter what they thought. However, there were also benefits. This action confirmed the so-called slave contract. From the perspective of the nobles, if there was no problem, they would not have mobilized so many troops. Then, I am afraid that everyone will inadvertently think about Salazar Slytherin.

"There is one more thing. Grandpa." Severus thought about it and told the story in the book again, and also told his guess. Although he didn't expect who was in the book, it was definitely a history of about a thousand years.

Wharton was indeed shocked. Salazar's incident was a special case, but this was the first time he heard of the soul in the book... But since he was looking for Salazar, he naturally couldn't neglect it. "The books in the library cannot leave Hogwarts. I will find a chance to mention this matter to Salazar."

After hanging up the two-way mirror, Severus was silent for a while, then he reopened the book and looked at the face that affected his aesthetics, "Who are you?"

"I already said I don't remember." Face rolled his eyes, "I just remembered that I needed to find someone, that's all."

"Salazar Slytherin?" Severus gave a question mark.

This time, Lian didn't answer immediately. Instead, he closed his eyes and didn't know what he was doing. After a while, he answered, "Yes, I want to find him." At this time, Lian's voice was no longer as jumpy as before. Instead, it sounded unusually low and serious.

70 House of Arrest
The next morning, Eaton unexpectedly showed up at the Slytherin table and quietly sat down next to Severus. This surprised many people. Severus was relieved. He had already memorized Eaton's schedule and planned to go to the classroom to block him.

"Eaton, long time no see." Anne ignored the strange atmosphere around her and smiled as she came to Eaton's side to greet him. The Hufflepuff table and the Slytherin table were close to each other, only a few steps away. "Professor Slughorn has assigned a lot of tasks recently. I have a lot of questions that I want to ask you. May I bother you today?"

Although Anne and Eaton's relationship cannot be called friendship, it can be considered friendly. As two families that have been friends for generations, even if Wharton is here, he will treat this gentle girl who has an absolute affinity for plants and even exudes the fragrance of plants as his junior.

"Okay." Eaton nodded and agreed.

"That's great. See you in the library then." Anne was very happy. As Slughorn's apprentice, she had worked very hard. Even so, the professor seemed very dissatisfied with her.

Severus glanced at Anne's back and frowned slightly. He suddenly felt unhappy. He glanced at Eaton from the corner of his eye. It seemed that Eaton didn't intend to talk to him. Instead, he focused on the food. Suddenly, he felt that the food in his mouth became tasteless. Severus had been thinking about how to talk to Eaton during the whole meal. Because of Eaton's danger, he suddenly felt that his little thoughts were insignificant. He had been determined to stay by Eaton's side before, and this was not affected by Eaton's will at all. But he said that before, which only proved that he became greedy. Obviously, he had nothing before, and everything he had was given by Eaton. But he didn't know when he became greedy...

Until the end, when Eaton got up and followed Zabini who came to find him to go to class, Severus still hadn't figured out what to say.

Sirius touched Severus carefully and got a fierce glare in return. He felt wronged, "Well, we should go to class too." After all, he is the class leader, can you give him some face? I've been waiting for you alone.

"Severus, I'll show you something at noon." Sirius said softly when Severus stood up, and then pretended nothing had happened and took the Slytherin first years to class in a dignified manner. According to the Slytherin house rules, group classes are required in the first week. After all, the location of the classroom is unfamiliar and it will cause a lot of trouble.

In the corridor on the way to the Magic Rune class, Zabini kept stealing glances at Eaton, and from time to time he also looked at the classmates around him covertly. It was just before class time, and there were students whispering all around. Zabini also greeted people he knew from time to time, and flirted everywhere, fearing that others would not notice his hormone index.

"I haven't seen you for a long time, Eton. You rarely go out, don't you?" Zabini complained with a smile, "I can't even find you."

"What do you want from me?" Please get to the point. This Orville Zabini has changed a lot since his father remarried a year ago. Although he wants to get closer to Prince, he is still too weak. As an heir, he cannot even collect the most basic information. It is impossible to resolve Prince's hatred for Zabini. There can only be one ending for the Zabini family.

"As a friend, I naturally have to show some concern." Zabini replied, "Well, I don't have such a good chance to have a romantic encounter. You know, the one who just invited you is also a rare beauty. How about giving her to me? My potion skills are not bad either."

"It's up to you." Eaton walked into the classroom without looking around and sat down. Professor Mowen was already standing on the podium preparing lecture notes.

Severus spent the whole morning with a serious expression, serious eyes, and an empty mind. He decided to go to Eaton's room tonight to apologize. He didn't like these days at all. There was no direction, no motivation, no warmth, only one persistence, insisting on making Eaton compromise. It was this persistence that made Eaton and him distanced. He couldn't figure out what happened to him before. His purpose was to get closer, but he ended up being away. He suddenly began to hate himself.

"Severus, don't be so sad, I've brought you to the secret passage..." Sirius chattered for a long time, but when he saw Severus standing there motionless with no expression, he immediately became discouraged and sat down on the ground.

Severus looked at Sirius with empty eyes for a while before he began to look at this so-called secret passage. "Where is this?"

"Aha, you finally woke up." Sirius jumped up and pointed excitedly at the endless passage covered with dust and spider webs. "James and I found it. I'll tell you a secret. This is the path to the Forbidden Forest~"

"Forbidden Forest?" Severus staggered as Sirius pulled him. He glared at the excited Sirius sternly, but it was obvious that his words caught his attention. "From where?"

"I told you that you had no idea just now... You definitely can't guess!" Sirius proudly stretched out his fingers and waved them. He looked like he deserved a beating. At least Severus' temper made him take out his wand. "Announce the answer. You must have never been to Hufflepuff, right? Oh, and the kitchen is over there too! You can't imagine the scene when we found the kitchen. There were so many house-elves. I've never seen so many."

"Let's get to the point." Severus frowned and interrupted Sirius's chatter.

"Well, when we went to steal food, Filch accidentally followed us, so we accidentally fell into a huge landscape painting nearby, and then came here." Sirius said it quickly in a somewhat depressed tone after being interrupted.

Severus looked back at where he came from. It was a wall. He walked over and carefully stretched out his hand. Sure enough, it was the same setting as the entrance of the Hogwarts Express, which could be passed through using magic. "Have you been to the Forbidden Forest?"

"I only dared to show my head secretly, and came back immediately after I found out where it was." Sirius refused to tell James that he had stopped him from going to the Forbidden Forest. What was the Forbidden Forest? He had known it clearly when he was at home, so he would not go in without knowing his own limitations. Moreover, the exit was not at the border of the Forbidden Forest, but obviously at the center!

"Well, anyway, I know you'll be interested." Sirius threw away all the messy thoughts and focused on asking for praise.

"You were assigned to the wrong college." Severus took the lead and walked in the other direction of the secret passage. He needed to confirm the location of the forbidden forest.

"There's nothing wrong with being a Gryffindor." Sirius muttered. Seeing Severus walking away, he could only run and stumble to catch up with him, walking side by side with Severus. "Do you really think I'm suitable for Gryffindor?" He couldn't help but

Severus snorted, "Look at you, I'm afraid you've already thrown your Slytherin tricks to Merlin."

...Sirius couldn't refute this. From school to now, although his family always wrote letters of praise and compliments, and various snacks and rewards were constantly given, that was also because Narcissa and Bellatrix helped to cover up. His former aristocratic model had long been abandoned. Now Sirius, except for studying, has no trace of Slytherin in etiquette, behavior, manners and speech. Oh, of course, maybe lying can be thrown out. After all, Sirius had promised that only four people knew about this secret passage and it would not be spread to others.

The other end of the secret passage was indeed the Forbidden Forest. The entrance was covered by a rock, and it looked more like a hidden cave entrance. Judging from the sounds of the surrounding creatures, it should be the center of the Forbidden Forest. At least Severus heard the sound of a unicorn. The unicorns have always been in the center of the Forbidden Forest. Except for a few who go out to play, most of them are concentrated in their territory, so it is easy to distinguish.

"You are lucky." Severus focused his attention on the bottom of the passage and said,

"Of course, if you're not lucky, you won't be able to find the secret passage!" Sirius agreed with the theory of luck.

"You are lucky that you didn't return to Merlin's arms quietly." Severus suddenly pulled Sirius and ran quickly towards Hogwarts.

"What, what's wrong, Severus?" Sirius realized that something was wrong, and without Severus pulling him, he ran quickly, "Is there something wrong?"

Without Severus's reply, Sirius heard a rustling sound, and a creepy feeling swept over his body. He immediately followed Severus and ran desperately until the two of them fell out of the portrait and returned to Hogwarts. It was a dead end here, and no Hufflepuff would have nothing to do but come here to look. Otherwise, the two of them would be caught red-handed.

"Well, what is that..." Sirius breathed heavily, lying on the ground a little detached. He felt jealous when he saw Severus standing upright without any difficulty breathing... What kind of physical strength is that?

Of course Severus knew what it was. He was too careless... He really couldn't trust this idiot Black too much.

"Humph, stop wandering around idle in the future. Watch out for your life."

"Damn, I have to notify James and the others. They can't come in here again. Hiss, I felt cold all over just now." Sirius rubbed his arm with lingering fear. After a while, he climbed up and took a last look at the portrait, wondering whether he should notify Headmaster Dumbledore.

Severus thought about mentioning this matter to Eaton in the evening. After all, he was the Slytherin's contract holder, and Salazar would probably want to know the news that the Slytherin pet had woken up, although Salazar had made it clear that he did not want to return to Hogwarts.

***

"I'm sorry, please have a good sleep... I can't help it, don't blame me..."

***

Severus had been thinking of many things to say to Eaton all day. He wanted to tell Eaton that he was no longer greedy, that he would make friends obediently, and that he would do whatever Eaton wanted him to do. Unfortunately, all this was doomed to fail. For the whole night, he could not find Eaton in the dormitory or through the two-way mirror. He thought Eaton had returned to Prince Manor, but after contacting Wharton, he found that Eaton was not at Prince Manor...

"Grandpa, please look for it again." Severus had a very ominous premonition.

"No." Salazar took the two-sided mirror, his red eyes filled with coldness, "Don't forget, you are a Gryffindor contractor. Can't you even contact Hogwarts to find out the situation? If so, don't do it and just die."

Getler was infected by Wharton's nervousness. He put on his clothes with a frown on his face. After thinking for a while, he took out the Elder Wand that Eaton had returned to him from the dragon leather bag in the storage cabinet. The owner of the wand was still him. "I'm going to contact the Saint now. If there is any news, notify me immediately."
71 House Exposure
Sarah looked at Gettler who was hurrying out the door without saying anything, but at the moment the door closed, she instantly pulled Wharton's wrist, slid her index finger, and blood gushed out in an instant... Before Wharton could react, the blood was suspended in the air as Salazar danced like a dance, and gradually formed unknown shapes with the dance of her fingertips and the unknown language.

Walton knew that Salazar was looking for Eaton, so he endured the pain and looked anxiously at the shape in the air, then at Salazar, hoping to hear Salazar tell him where his grandson was in the next second. He firmly believed that this was much more powerful than blood magic.

The blood in the air actually formed a mountain shape covered by plants. Salazar stopped his spell, but his expression became more serious. He waved his hand casually, and the blood spontaneously returned to Wharton's body through the wound on his wrist. The wound healed immediately, leaving only a black streak.

"He's still in Hogwarts." Salazar's magic began to become unstable. "Contact Snape. We are going to Hogwarts."

When Salazar and Wharton arrived at Hogwarts, Severus had been nervous for a long time and was on the verge of collapse. He had contacted Peeves, and according to Peeves, in the afternoon, Eaton left the dormitory and went to the library to chat with a Hufflepuff girl for a while, then left Hogwarts Castle alone for a while, then Eaton returned to the common room, but went out again not long after, and never came back since then.

"Come out!" Salazar appeared in the Slytherin lounge without any hesitation, and ignored the surprised, terrified eyes in the lounge. The heavy magical pressure caused the sofa in the lounge to collapse instantly, and the people sitting on it instantly stiffened their bodies, not daring to move at all.

Wharton wanted to hold Salazar back, but he failed and he appeared in front of everyone. They knew the temper of this snake ancestor well enough over the years and he didn't care about anything at all.

At this time, the Slytherins did not know about Eaton's disappearance, but were enjoying a normal evening of chatting. However, everything was interrupted by the sudden appearance of two people. The red-eyed man who was suppressing their magic and making them breathless was indeed the most terrifying existence for them.

Severus had received the news when Salazar and the others had just arrived at Hogwarts. The contract person was still useful. At this moment, he rushed out, suppressed the panic and regret in his heart, and stood in front of the two.

"It's not your turn yet." Salazar looked at Severus, who was full of regret and panic, coldly, "Go back to your Gryffindor, and don't insult my Slytherin here."

Peeves has been staying in Slytherin since he realized something was wrong. Barrow and other ghosts also gathered in the Slytherin Common Room immediately after sensing Salazar's spirit. "Salazar... this is not surprising..."

"Who is the new leader of the Forbidden Forest? Tell him to search the entire forest." Salazar interrupted Peeves coldly, "If any magical creature breaks the contract, don't blame me for following suit."

"Yes." Peeves disappeared immediately and went to summon the guardians of the Forbidden Forest in the name of Hogwarts Castle. He also gave up the idea of ​​pleading for Severus. It was not that he didn't want to, but he had no choice.

When Severus heard this, he seemed to be motivated and immediately rushed out of the Slytherin common room. Walton, who wanted to hold him back, was stopped by Salazar with a look.

"Salazar...Are you Salazar Slytherin?" Lucius saw that Severus and Patriarch Prince were there, but Eaton was missing. He immediately felt that the situation seemed bad. "What happened? Patriarch Prince."

"Malfoy..." Salazar tilted his head and squinted his red eyes, glancing up and down at Lucius. Noticing Lucius, he also noticed the Slytherin students around him, who were tense and breathless, with no aristocratic manners at all, but looking at him with bright eyes. "Do you know what is most important? Tonight, it is possible that all of you will die here. This is the key point."

...What do you mean? Almost all the students in the lounge were covered in cold sweat and began to tremble. They didn't want this to happen! Everyone's eyes were telling the same yearning and admiration, but their bodies honestly faced the murderous intent from Salazar.

"You... you are Slytherin, Slytherin is still alive! Still alive!" A student suddenly ran out of the passage and rushed towards Salazar, but fell to the ground halfway, but insisted on crawling towards Salazar.

"Salazar! Let's go to the Forbidden Forest and look for him directly. Finding Eaton is the most important thing now!" Wharton stopped Salazar's raised index finger, which was a sign that Salazar was about to cast a spell.

"No, Slytherin is still alive, haha, really alive, I will tell the lord that Slytherin's glory will surely reappear! The magic world will regain its glory!!!" This student... Dolohov laughed loudly, and he crawled to Salazar's feet without knowing when, stretched out his head to kiss his robe,

"You guys are really noisy." Salazar sneered. This is his Slytherin student? Really? He would never admit it! His students are always insidious, cold, know how to protect themselves, know how to protect what they cherish by any means, and never have faith.

"Slytherin, Lord." Barrow stood in front of Salazar in time, forcing Dolohov to shrink his head back as if he had been doused with extremely cold water. The other ghosts also lined up and used their transparent bodies to block Salazar's view of the crowd. "We can also help."

"No need." Salazar didn't understand why these ghosts wanted to protect these students, but they had been with him for a thousand years and were his family. He would not go against their wishes. "You will consume a lot of energy after leaving Hogwarts. Don't tell me that you are going to sacrifice yourselves for a few students that I absolutely don't recognize."

"Times have changed, Mr. Slytherin." Barrow still maintained a blank expression, but his words were serious. "You are their only faith."

at the same time……

"Hmm... This feeling is so familiar..." Eaton struggled to wake up. The oppressive feeling all over his body made him feel very uncomfortable. "Where is this place?" He struggled as hard as he could, but found that there was no magic power in his body. His hands were tied and he could not move at all.

It was dark all around, but the small space and familiar smell made Eaton realize his situation. He was inside a giant Bulgarian carnivorous plant. This was a plant he had studied before, a plant that was extremely dangerous to wizards because the venom in the flower itself would make wizards lose their magic power.

"Huh... I was still careless." Eaton tried to move his fingers, and moved them with difficulty to untie the rope according to the previous techniques. Although this rope was made of the strongest dragon leather rope, the tightness was adjusted according to the size of the wrist... He really spared no effort to catch him.

In the past, they were always cut off and placed in the laboratory for dissection, but now staying here... It doesn't feel very good, it feels like it's staying in the stomach. Fortunately, this Piranha plant is probably a modified version, and apart from eliminating his magic power, it did not corrode his body.

Fortunately, Zabini's words also made him more alert, but he never thought that there was a way that he could not detect, and he was caught. At this time, I don't know how anxious Severus and his family will be. I hope Salazar will not go crazy and do whatever he wants. His body that has been imprisoned for a thousand years has not recovered to the point where he can do whatever he wants. Eaton was thinking wildly while moving his arm little by little. With the lubrication of the mucus, he finally let his hand touch the space bag hidden in his arms.

Severus was scratched all over while stumbling and running aimlessly around looking for someone, but he couldn't care less. At this moment, the Forbidden Forest was his only hope to find Eaton, and he would never give up! It was all because of him, all because of him. He should have been with Eaton in the morning, and his grandfather had told him yesterday that he must stay by Eaton's side. He had promised to protect Eaton's safety, but look at what he did? ! At night, why did he have to wait until night to apologize, why couldn't he let go of his awkward thoughts and talk to Eaton directly, why did he indulge in his willfulness and ignorance even though he knew Eaton was in danger... In the process of constantly destroying plants to search, Severus kept questioning himself like this.

"Eaton... please, don't be in trouble, please." Severus was knocked to the ground by the fallen branches, and a drop of crystal liquid dripped on the dead leaves.

"Gryffindor's contractor, all members of the Forbidden Forest have been dispatched to search for Slytherin's contractor." A horseman ran down and stood beside Severus, leaning down and helping Severus up. "Due to the special circumstances, you can stay on my back. I will take you around to search."

"No, let's search separately." Severus rejected the proposal. With more strength, it would speed up the process. No one knew Eaton's current situation, but no one could give him a good word. "Didn't you hear me? I said to search separately!"

The centaur looked at Severus' current injuries, sighed, and ran in another direction.

At this time, Slughorn, who was in the Potions Office, was sitting there with a frown on his face. Finally, he just walked back and forth on the floor, as if something was bothering him. From time to time, he glanced in the direction of the lounge.
72 House Mystery
"No, this matter..." Slughorn finally sat on the sofa, frustrated and tugged at the few remaining hair. His originally smooth hair became extremely postmodern abstract style under his messy technique.

"Yes, I'm going to resign. I can't stay in Hogwarts anymore." He jumped up from the sofa where he had just sat for less than a minute. His body was as bouncy as a ball. He ran to the bottom of the cabinet and pulled out a suitcase. He frantically took things out of the cabinet and stuffed them into the suitcase until the entire cabinet was empty. He dragged the suitcase to the desk and scrambled through the documents related to the potion experiments.

"Professor Slughorn?" Dumbledore's voice came from the fireplace, causing Slughorn to freeze instantly. His eyes were filled with fear, but he was still in full control, forcibly suppressing the trembling of his body.

"Principal Dumbledore?" His back was still facing the fireplace. He slightly leaned to the side to block the suitcase. His slightly high voice exposed his abnormality. However, he was always lucky. At this moment, Principal Dumbledore was not in the mood to pay attention to these small details.

"Professor, this matter is very urgent. Hagrid just found me and I need your help." Headmaster Dumbledore did not come in person, but used the most convenient way to transmit the message through the fireplace, so he did not see the situation in the Potions Office at this time. Of course, if he had seen it, he probably would not think that Hagrid's matter was "very urgent".

Huh... Slughorn finally heaved a sigh of relief and collapsed to the ground. He finally came to his senses and looked at the fireplace in a daze, "Okay, Dumbledore, anything. ...Yes, anything." The last voice became very small and very hesitant.

"That's great, my old friend. Hagrid has discovered something unusual in the Forbidden Forest. Our magical creature friends seem to have become unusually... active and restless tonight. I need some potions, and we need to go into the Forbidden Forest together. Of course, the materials for potions are very abundant in the Forbidden Forest." Dumbledore obviously knew his old friend very well. Given his temperament, he would never get up early without benefits. Whenever he wanted him to do something, he had to give him enough benefits and security.

"Oh, of course. I'll be there right away." Slughorn did not respond positively as Dumbledore wished. Instead, he was very calm, almost indifferent.

"We'll meet at the edge of the Forbidden Forest." After saying that, Dumbledore stopped the call. He seemed a little anxious. After all, even he couldn't tell how many kinds of magical creatures there were in the Forbidden Forest. Once a riot broke out, his students would be in extremely dangerous situations, and Hogwarts would no longer be safe. This was absolutely not allowed.

Slughorn sat on the ground and calmed down for a long time before he slowly got up. He looked at his suitcase coldly, and finally took out his wand and put the things back to where they should be. He couldn't leave Hogwarts yet. Tom's power couldn't completely penetrate Hogwarts at this time, so he would be the safest here. Although this matter was troublesome, Tom didn't intend to mark him compulsorily. He could still hold on for a few more years. When the half-blood Snape grew up, he could find a way to push him to the sight of others. A half-blood Prince would be a more valuable bargaining chip than him, so what he should do now was to win over Snape. At most, he could make a few losing deals, but in comparison, life was the most precious. ... He must not leak that secret, absolutely not.

As time passed, Slughorn suddenly reacted, hurriedly took a few bottles from the potion cabinet and stuffed them into his arms, then hurried out the door and headed towards the Forbidden Forest.

His haste made him miss the opportunity to notice the abnormality in the lounge. The Potions Office was not far from the lounge. As long as he turned back, he would find that the portrait at the door of the lounge had turned blank.

"Barrow, do you know what you are talking about?" Salazar replied coldly. He is the faith of these people? Is this a joke?

"I know, Mr. Slytherin." Barrow nodded. Although he couldn't make any expression, there was still admiration in his eyes. The reason why he was willing to protect these students was because Salazar Slytherin was his eternal belief. "Your ideals are the direction of my sword."

Ideal? Salazar raised his eyebrows. "I never knew I had an ideal."

This made all the Slytherins, including Wharton, stunned. All the surprises about Slytherin still being alive and appearing in front of them were not as shocking as this sentence. What did he mean by he had no ideals? If not, then what was the world of pure blood? What was it about letting wizards become the masters of the world? What was it about purging bloodlines... What was their family doing?

The emotions in these people's eyes made Salazar understand something. After all this time, the slogan of the so-called Dark Lord was his ideal? What a joke.

"Don't force that kind of thing on me." Salazar was very disgusted by this. He was the kind of person who would ignore anyone except those who agreed with him. Now, a bunch of people told him, 'Oh, this is your ideal, you have to yearn for it in this way and that way, we are all fighting for your ideal'. Is this just a joke out of boredom, or is it a provocation to his dignity?

"Even if it is a misunderstanding, sir, it is because of my admiration for you. You have always been the only one Slytherin looks up to." Barrow insisted on his point of view, "Bins has lost his vision and passion. He can no longer tell the students the real you."

Salazar pursed his lips. He couldn't convince himself to blame Binns and other ghosts who had given so much for him. Because of him, many ghosts had already disappeared, and the remaining ones had also lost too much energy, especially Binns who had always stayed by his side and told him vividly about the outside world for hundreds of years. He could feel that Binns' passion was slowly fading away in the repeated consumption.

"I understand." Salazar finally compromised. "They won't remember what happened today or who I am today. But Baro, remember, don't use you to protect them anymore. I never remember teaching Slytherin to hide behind people. Even now, this is something they must understand and implement resolutely. The next time we meet, I will still be myself, but if they continue like this, I will not compromise anymore."

"Yes, sir." Barrow retreated, and the ghosts looked at each other. In the end, they still didn't dare to go forward to disturb Salazar, but they were unwilling to leave. So some floated in the air, some had no place to stay and had to stay in the wall and tried hard to show their faces, and some were stacked in layers and squatting in one place. The shapes of the ghosts surprised Wharton. They were really a very creative group... Look at these difficult movements. We don't have enough exposure to them in normal times. Maybe with more exposure, our thinking will become more active.

"Salazar, what do we do now?" Wharton saw that no one in Slytherin dared to speak, and the man lying on the ground had lost consciousness at some point, and no one knew when Salazar made his move.

Salazar ignored Wharton's question and drew an arc in the air with his right index finger. "Everyone in the dormitory, come to the lounge."

As soon as he finished speaking, more than a dozen doors were opened instantly, and the students walked into the lounge in order. If you look closely, their eyes have become a little blank and their emotions cannot be seen clearly.

"You all chat and play tonight until it's time to rest. This will be all you remember about tonight. Now, listen to my orders and go back to your beds. It's getting late and it's time to rest." Salazar changed his hand shapes and a wave of magic power spread out from him, refreshing the memories of the students present over and over again, until the students returned to their rooms one after another and the lounge became empty. Then he put down his hands and frowned. Even he would feel a little powerless with the large-scale memory magic, not to mention that the wounds caused by the curse on his body had not yet healed completely.

"Salazar, drink it." Walton stepped forward, took out a brown potion bottle and handed it to Salazar. Seeing his slightly narrowed eyes, he sighed and explained, "Eaton asked me to carry it with me. He is worried that you will use magic indiscriminately."

Salazar then relaxed his brows, concealed the doubt in his eyes, took the potion bottle and drank it without hesitation. In this respect, he was actually very gullible.

Barrow and other ghosts who saw this scene all became inexplicably gloomy, even slightly annoyed and worried. They would never forget the scene a thousand years ago, even though they were still young students at the time. Now, Salazar had someone he trusted wholeheartedly again, which made them worry that the scene would happen again. This would hurt Salazar too much. After all, his trust in people came so inexplicably, and losing his trust would cost him almost his entire life.

"Sir Slytherin, Dumbledore has taken a few professors to the Forbidden Forest." Peeves came in quickly and said a little embarrassedly. He was too careless. It was easy to communicate with the Forbidden Forest with the consciousness of Hogwarts. The problem was that he didn't say to keep a low profile and reduce the noise... So things seemed to get out of hand. What's worse, the Gryffindor kid was in the Forbidden Forest...

At this time, Eaton was struggling to crawl out of the Piranha Plant that he had cut open from the inside. The sticky venom made his movements somewhat difficult, and the previous invasion of venom also consumed a lot of Eaton's strength. When he completely got rid of it, he could only lie flat on the ground exhausted and gasping violently...
73 House Meeting
"Hagrid? Is that you, Hagrid?" A series of tapping sounds came from the large hole not far from where Eaton was lying, as if countless feet were running on the ground. This made Eaton immediately understand his situation...

Aragog... Hagrid once accidentally let slip the name of this giant acromantula, which, by the way, is a really weird name. But considering the many bottles of venom, Eaton had no objection... Unfortunately, at this time, his opinion would be magnified to infinity.

He quickly took out the energy potion from the shrunken space bag and drank it. The energy potion would take about 5 minutes to take effect. Eaton's brain was quickly analyzing how to delay the 5 minutes. Judging from the sound, this big hole was probably the gathering place of the eight-eyed giant spider family. There were at least hundreds of them. The eight-eyed giant spiders ate meat, and there were many records of wizards being eaten by this kind of spiders. This was why the eight-eyed giant spiders were expelled from the wizard world several times and driven into the distant forest. Eaton quickly glanced around, and there were no spider-eating birds around...

He struggled to get up and leaned against the fallen Piranha Plant. This Piranha Plant was the only one left in the area. It was unexpectedly transplanted directly in front of the eight-eyed giant spider's nest... This was really premeditated to prevent him from escaping. It was indeed well thought out.

Soon, hundreds of spiders surrounded Eaton, their eyes full of greed and desire, their feet stomping on the ground, but they never dared to move forward, until the giant spider appeared at the entrance of the cave, revealing his true face. This was a spider that had passed its prime, and although it was no longer strong, it was obviously very authoritative. Of course, it was also the largest one Eaton had ever seen... It was probably a mutation. Hagrid's taste was as bad as ever.

"You are not Hagrid, who are you and why are you in my territory." Aragog tapped his two front paws and asked. He had promised Hagrid not to hurt anyone, but his children had longed for the fragrant meaty smell of the little wizard for a long time, but he had always suppressed it. Apart from the wizard with the disgusting smell, this was the first wizard who took the initiative to enter their territory. Tonight, he would not be able to say no to his children.

"I'm afraid you're wrong, Aragog." Eaton felt his strength returning to his body little by little, and replied coldly, "Don't forget where you are. You are in a territory you shouldn't be in. Although the Forbidden Forest has not fulfilled its obligation to eliminate you because Hogwarts lost the contract for many years, you should not forget your roots."

Aragog stared at Eaton with his big eyes for a long time, so long that the children around him began to get restless and kept asking him to eat the wizard. "I have lived here for many years, and no one can kill me, little wizard. Although I promised Hagrid not to hurt anyone, you are not Hagrid, so no one will know that you have been here... My children have been hungry for a long time."

"Are you sure you want to do this, Aragog?" Eaton stood up, his body still sticky with the venom of the Piranha Plant. "See the plant next to me? The Piranha Plant, its venom can burn the shell of any Acromantula, not to mention the internal organs. Also, don't you find that the Forbidden Forest is a little too restless today?" In the distance, he heard the sounds of many limbs touching the ground.

"No magical creatures will come here. Don't count on it, little wizard." Aragog's voice was still calm. "This is the territory of spiders." After saying that, he retreated back into the cave.

As the words fell, a large number of spiders quickly ran towards Eaton. The speed of the Acromanthus was world-famous and it was the champion of the spider world. Eaton had no magic power at this time and could not connect with any magical power, including Hogwarts. His physical strength was only half restored because of the energy potion. The only thing he could do at this time was to empty the space bag on his body and sprinkle bottles of poisonous potions in the middle of the seamless siege of spiders. He did not carry potions for Acromanthus with him. Thinking about it now, he might have a little regret. Who knows, but he knew that Aragog was right. Those hooves would not step into the spider's territory. The surrounding area was sprinkled with their special smell by this damn spider, and other magical creatures could not stand that smell. Maybe he would face death again today...

But he actually resisted, he didn't want to die... He still had Severus, if he died, what would happen to Severus's child, he would definitely die with him! This was absolutely not okay, the child couldn't die, absolutely not... Suddenly, Eaton felt a little flustered, and when he poured a bottle of corrosive potion, his mind suddenly froze for a moment... He seemed to understand his feelings for Severus.

Waves of spiders died from the poison, and the next wave was still running around, trying to get close to Eaton, while more were looking for opportunities to break through the venom around Eaton. Several spiders began to climb up the trees around Eaton, closely watching the movements of Eaton's hands, ready to find an opportunity to pounce.

At the moment when Eaton paused, a spider on the tree pounced directly on Eaton's head, with a ferocious look in its eyes and excitement of eating delicious food...

Snapped……

The spiders around paused, somewhat puzzled as to why another spider on the tree pounced on and bit its companion who was about to bite the delicious food... After a while, when they reacted and pounced on Eaton again, several more spiders pounced on their companions. This confused the little spider, who was not very smart to begin with, and it stood still, staring at Eaton, as if thinking.

This gave Eaton time. Magical creatures have very strong wills, and Eaton could control very little of them, and it was very easy for them to backfire. Fortunately, with Severus as his pillar, Eaton gritted his teeth and endured the mental pain for a chance to survive. He also wanted to see Severus, he wanted to hug Severus, kiss his slightly red face, and look at his shiny black eyes that were happy to meet his needs. Therefore, he must not die. He believed that Severus would find him, firmly believed it.

"Where is ahead? Why don't you guys go in!" Severus finally walked deep into the Forbidden Forest, only to find that all the animals bypassed this area. "Speak! As the Gryffindor Contractor, I order you. If you refuse, don't blame me for telling Salazar Slytherin that you violated the contract in the Forbidden Forest. If Eton gets hurt in the slightest, I will level the Forbidden Forest. Believe me, I will."

The two centaurs who happened to be there looked at each other in embarrassment. "This is an exception. The creatures here do not belong to the Forbidden Forest. But until tonight, we learned that the leader of the Forbidden Forest is still here... So..."

"So you let these creatures live in the Forbidden Forest, so you don't even dare to go in, so you are extremely selfish and allow dangerous creatures to come, right?" Severus glared at the two men fiercely, his body shaking with anger, "Okay, if you don't go in, I will."

After saying that, he rushed in straight away, and no one could stop him. Today's incident laid a solid foreshadowing for the image of the professor who would be extremely cold and merciless towards magical creatures in the future.

"Ronan, what should we do?" The younger man asked anxiously. The leader had said in the message that the safety of Gryffindor's contracted people must be protected. There are eight-eyed giant spiders in here, creatures they are all afraid of! They can't be killed, and the exhaustion tactics can't overcome them at all. Moreover, there is no species in their Forbidden Forest that can control these eight-eyed giant spiders. If they go in, they will only be buried with them.

"What should we do! Gather all creatures quickly, we are about to have a bloody battle." This kid didn't know how terrifying Salazar was, but that didn't mean he didn't know. The elders had described him as extremely cold and powerful. That was the power of the Dark Royal Family. Who could conquer it? !

"Eaton? Eaton?" Severus shouted as he ran. He didn't care about anything else. Now he just wanted to find Eaton.

The outer spiders surrounding Eaton came to their senses and looked in the direction of the sound, then looked back at Eaton, as if hesitating whether to attack another food.

"Severus?!" Eaton relaxed, endured the pain in his head and shouted with all his might, then collapsed to the ground. This action completely exposed him to the spider's mouth. The originally hesitant spider immediately rushed up again and covered Eaton's entire body.

This was what Severus saw. His mind went blank and he instinctively took out his wand. The strongest flames gushed out and rushed towards those hateful spiders. In an instant, the spiders retreated and left Eaton's body. What Severus saw was Eaton lying on the ground, covered in mucus and motionless.

"You... all must die." Severus' eyes turned red with hatred, and his hand holding the wand trembled and tightened again and again, "Devil's flame! All of you must die, die! Devil's flame!"

Severus was radiating the devil's fire spell everywhere like he was desperate. This spell would not stop until the opponent's soul was burned out. Anyone who was touched by the flames would be burned. Pieces of flames connected together, forming a raging fire here. Fortunately, the surrounding plants were not magical plants because of the giant spider, but ordinary flowers and plants, so they did not have souls, otherwise this would cause the destruction of the entire forbidden forest. At this time, Severus was obviously holding the idea of ​​dying together. Because the devil's fire consumed not only the opponent's soul, but also his extremely large amount of magic power.

"Oh, what is that?" Professor McGonagall looked at the faint flames in front of her in panic... "Merlin, that's the devil's fire, Albus!!"

Dumbledore was also staring at that side, and nodded silently at this time, "Yes, that's right, it seems we have something to do, hurry up." After that, he hurried over there quickly.

"Oh no, that's Aragog..." When Hagrid said this, he immediately reacted and covered his mouth, but it was too late.

All the professors stopped and stared at Hagrid. Dumbledore also stopped and walked back. "Hagrid, tell me, what is that?"

Hagrid rubbed his fingers nervously, his eyes drifting a little, but his mouth was tightly closed, and he refused to say a word.

"Hagrid, if something really happened there today, I will not forgive you." Dumbledore's expression was very serious. This was the Forbidden Forest, the natural protection of Hogwarts, and no problems could occur. If it was really Hagrid's fault, then everything would be absolutely unforgivable.

"Aragog won't cause any trouble, he's very well behaved," Hagrid retorted instinctively, before he realized what he had said. He carefully observed the expressions of the other professors around him, and he became even more conflicted.

"It's almost too late, Albus. We must rush there immediately. So far, we haven't seen a single creature. I'm afraid they have all gathered there." Mag was also angry, but at this moment she knew what was more important.

"Let's go." Dumbledore took a last look at the ashamed Hagrid and hurried towards the fire.

"Eaton..." Not long after, with a voice that Severus could not remember, the few remaining spiders quickly retreated back into the cave. Severus insisted on walking to the motionless Eaton. As the exhaustion wand fell, Severus fell to his knees, carefully picked up Eaton, and held him tightly in his arms.
74 House Saved
Severus hugged Eaton tightly, but the despair and sadness in his eyes suddenly disappeared when the breath gently brushed across his face, and was replaced by great joy.

"Eaton? Eaton, wake up, Eaton!" Severus finally regained his sanity after letting go of the hand that was tightly holding him. He let Eaton lie flat on the ground, hurriedly picked up the wand, and quickly recalled the healing spells he had learned.

Tonight does not seem to be a lucky night for Eaton and Severus. Aragog soon realized something. A large number of spiders poured out of the cave again and surrounded the two young wizards. At this time, they did not seem to intend to attack. Instead, they seemed more anxious and anxious. Aragog also walked out of the cave slowly but with full momentum. He did not stay at the cave entrance as before, but quickly stepped out of the cave, blocking the sight of Severus behind him.

Aragog was facing an extremely large group of magical creatures. Thousands of magical creatures living in the Forbidden Forest gathered together for the first time in hundreds of years, surrounding the entire territory of the Acromanthus, for the common purpose. Tonight, for them, it will be a sleepless and bloody night. For so many years, their comfortable life may end today, but they cannot regret it, because this is their war, a war to protect the territory and defend their own race. Goal: rescue the Hogwarts contract person, and destroy the spider by the way; Enemy: Acromanthus; War Catalyst: Salazar Slytherin; Battle Significance: Protect the lives and safety of the people, and do everything possible to prevent someone from killing.

"Mars is brighter than ever before today." To the right of the group of magical creatures was a team of centaurs, led by an elderly centaur elder with gray hair and a thin body. At this moment, he was gazing at the sky calmly and saying this silently.

"Elder, please allow me to take your place." Ronan stepped forward and said quietly. It was too dangerous here. The elder was old and his movements had lost the agility of a centaur. The eight-eyed giant spider was known for its speed and venom, and it was too dangerous to be in this position.

The elder obviously ignored what he said. The people behind Ronan secretly pulled the worried Ronan back.

"The eight-eyed giant spider is not a species that should exist in the Forbidden Forest. If you can lead your people to leave voluntarily, this casualty can be avoided." The unicorn elder took a step forward, with compassion. Unicorns have always been the purest creatures, but that doesn't mean they won't fight. In fact, unicorns have the strongest attack power, which is why they can survive to this day even though they are full of treasures.

"This territory has no owner. The eight-eyed giant spiders have lived here for many years and have long become a part of this forest." Aragog refused to give in. Although he had promised Hagrid not to hurt the little wizard, and in order to save his life, he had not violated any creatures living here. He thought they had reached a consensus, but today... Aragog thought of the two little wizards behind him. He was afraid that this matter was not that simple. What were the identities of these two little wizards that they had attracted such a huge enemy for him? As the leader of this group of eight-eyed giant spiders, he knew clearly that if he wanted to survive in a forest, he must not be enemies with other creatures, let alone all other species.

Thinking of this, Aragog took a few steps to the side, revealing Severus, who had already carried Eden on his back, holding a wand in his hand, and staring at the spiders around him vigilantly. Against the backdrop of the night, his small body was reflected in the eyes of all creatures as his tall figure and upright back. "These two little wizards have trespassed into my territory, but I promised Hagrid that I would not hurt them. I can let them go, but you must promise not to be an enemy of my Acromantula anymore."

The group of magical creatures facing Aragog suddenly started to whisper and discuss. The Centaur elder who was not participating in the discussion looked back at his own group with a little indifference, and a gleam of light flashed in his eyes. He looked up at the sky silently, and suddenly spoke, "That is a very terrible enemy, spider. What you provoke will become the source of your darkness. That half-giant can't give you any help, and you will even bring him into an irretrievable disaster."

The elder's voice made the discussion of evolution and quarrels disappear instantly, and all creatures fell silent. This elder was the most authoritative among the Centaurs, and his astrological predictions were never wrong. Salazar Slytherin, the eternal king of darkness, was the reason for their existence in the Forbidden Forest. The reason why there were no powerful dark creatures here was because of this king, who liked to nip threats in the bud.

Unfortunately, however, Aragog, as a latecomer, did not know the facts that he should know.

"Either leave, and I will let these two little wizards return to the castle safely, or fight. The Acromantula has never been afraid of fighting, and it is the same now. These two little wizards can just replenish the energy of my children." Aragog simply turned a deaf ear to those words.

"Aragog, what are you talking about?! Stop it!" Hagrid's loud voice came from behind the vast swarm of creatures. It turned out that the professors, who had been as late as the police, had finally arrived.

"Oh, what happened here, Hagrid! Those are two little wizards, and there are two students here!" McGonagall was the first to realize the key point, and at this time Dumbledore's brows were furrowed to a new level.

"Please make way, let us pass!" Hagrid usually has a good relationship with magical creatures and knows the right ones. At the critical moment, he discovered the benefits of the unspoken rules of acquaintances. Soon, the wizards squeezed to the front.

"Oh my god... Severus Snape!" Professor McGonagall touched her chest in surprise. She thought it was a student from her college. After all, this has become a routine. Only Gryffindor students would trespass into the Forbidden Forest. She never expected that it was two Slytherin students who caused such a big trouble... Well, you don't need to guess who the other one is.

"Is that Eton Prince? What happened to him?" Slughorn suddenly walked out of the crowd and wanted to cross the group of spiders, but Aragog blocked his way with his body.

"Aragog, what are you doing? Let him go, he is a professor!" Hagrid was anxious. Even a thick-skinned man like him knew that the situation was not good. Aragog had caused the wrath of the Forbidden Forest, and all creatures had gathered here!

"Hagrid, I can't meet your request this time. If you let it go, tonight will be the end of our Acromantula." Aragog was very clear-headed. He should not have allowed the children to want to eat the little wizard, but it was useless now. At this moment, he could only try his best to protect his children.

"No, no, Ronan, tell me, and Orson, everyone in the Forbidden Forest lives in peace. Aragog promised me that he would not hurt anyone." Hagrid shook his big head, his shell-like eyes searching for familiar faces among the creatures, and then tried to ask for a reassurance, but got a silent answer.

Dumbledore realized that the current situation might not end well. When he saw the spider just now, he realized that he had made another mistake. He let Hagrid go. This spider should not have survived, but now it is not only alive but also forming a group. This is not a good thing. The reproductive capacity of the Acromantula is unique and the growth speed is very fast. Once the spider connected with Hagrid dies, the remaining spiders will be out of control.

"Please listen to me. Can I call you Aragog? My student's life or death is unknown. We need to confirm that it is a convention that Hogwarts wizards cannot participate in the Forbidden Forest. Please do not hurt my students." Dumbledore's face was stern, and he held the wand in his hand. Since the Elder Wand was taken away by Gettler, he used his own wand again.

Aragog's big eyes silently stared at the powerful wizard for a while, then looked at Hagrid's pleading eyes, and finally moved aside, without looking back to order the spiders to make way.

Dumbledore and four deans of the colleges hurried over, and couldn't help but pause when they saw Severus' eyes suddenly become fierce as he looked at them. Everyone knew that the conditions of the two children opposite were not right, one was completely unconscious, and the other had signs of corrosion all over his body, but he always remained vigilant and forbade anyone to get close to him.

"My child, don't worry, it's over. I'm here, everything will be fine." Dumbledore couldn't help but soothe Severus' emotions softly.

Slughorn didn't care about anything else and rushed forward. "How is he? Oh, my God, Severus, I'm your headmaster. Yes, turn your wand in another direction. Merlin, what happened to him? He's covered in venom."

"Hagrid! Didn't you say your Aragog wouldn't hurt anyone? Then why is there spider venom in Idun?" Slughorn shouted at Hagrid angrily. After that, he turned to Dumbledore without caring about anything else. "Dumbledore, he needs immediate treatment, immediately! We must send him to the infirmary immediately. Oh, Merlin, I have to brew the antidote quickly."

Upon seeing this, Dumbledore didn't care about anything else and said, "Professor McGonagall, you and Professor Slughorn, take these two students to the infirmary!"

"Severus, let me hold Eaton." Slughorn stretched out his hand to stop Eaton's body, but Severus dodged it.

"I will take him there, and I won't allow any of you to touch him." Severus turned his head to look at Eaton's face on his shoulder, carefully adjusted his position, and then walked step by step towards the Forbidden Forest, through the path where the magical creatures silently separated, and towards Hogwarts Castle.

"This won't work, Snape. Prince must be treated immediately!" McGonagall followed closely, frowning and criticizing sternly.

"Let me do it, Professor." Ronan walked out of the crowd and stood in front of Severus, lowering his body. "I will take you safely to the entrance of the Forbidden Forest."

This time Severus got on the horse without hesitation. After Ronan made sure it was stable, he quickly ran to the outside. This time it was Magg and Slughorn's turn to run out breathlessly, because there was really no one willing to carry them.

What happened in the Forbidden Forest afterwards, the professors and all the creatures who stayed there did not say a word. Hagrid was asked by Dumbledore to not enter the Forbidden Forest for a month, and he was locked up in his small room, not seeing anyone. However, none of them expected that when everyone dispersed and the professors returned to Hogwarts to gather in the infirmary to check on the two students, the Acromantula that was allowed to stay was actually facing the crisis of extinction.

"Is this the place?" Salazar stood in front of the messy cave entrance, his cold red eyes looking at everything around him, "Herbo, your dinner is here."

"How is Eton, Madam Pomfrey?" Slughorn rubbed his hands and asked anxiously.

"The venom has invaded his internal organs, and his magic power has disappeared. The worst thing is that his soul seems to be fluctuating violently." Pomfrey put down the wand in his hand and frowned. "I need antidotes for the poison of the Piranha plant and the Acromanthus giant spider, as well as soul soothing potions and magic soothing potions. The most important thing now is to stop his soul from fluctuating. If this continues, something serious will happen. If things don't go well tonight, he must be sent to San Gmang immediately."

Merlin... None of the professors had expected such serious consequences. At this moment, they had no time to study why two little wizards appeared in the territory of the eight-eyed giant spider in the middle of the night and were covered in injuries.

"I'll brew it. Give me an hour." Severus completely ignored his injuries and rejected Pomfrey's suggestion to check him out. Finally, he looked at Eaton and resolutely ran out of the infirmary, leaving no chance for anyone to stop him. Severus' words made Dumbledore and Slughorn suddenly worried... Can he brew these most advanced potions in just his first year?

75 House of Coma
At this time, there was no one in the lounge except Walton Prince. The ghost also left with Salazar, and the huge space seemed unusually empty. After Salazar left alone without saying a word, Walton could only pace back and forth in the Slytherin lounge anxiously, his worries were beyond words, and he hoped that the creatures in the forbidden forest would find his Eaton as soon as possible and send good news as soon as possible. So his eyes kept sweeping towards the door of the lounge, never tired of it.

When the heavy door moved, Wharton immediately stopped pacing excitedly and walked over quickly. When he saw his grandson rushing in with injuries all over his body, and there was no one behind him, Wharton's heart suddenly reached its highest point.

"Severus, where's Eaton?" Seeing that Severus didn't intend to pay attention to him and ran straight to his dormitory, Wharton hurried into Severus' dormitory and asked, "What's wrong with your injury?!"

Severus rushed to his potion box, quickly recalled the list of potion ingredients he had written down, and then picked up a pile of things he needed, "Grandpa, I need help."

Looking at Severus's eyes that were trying hard to hold back the silver light, Wharton immediately understood Eaton's situation, "How long?"

"One hour."

"To Prince Manor."

An hour later, Dumbledore and others who were still guarding the place and helping Mrs. Pomread to stabilize Eaton's soul fluctuations, waited for the still disheveled boy on time. However, if he had not ignored everyone, rushed forward to carefully lift up Eaton's head, tried to feed the potion to Eaton, but found that he could not feed it, they would have thought that this boy had a great adult soul.

"How could this happen? This shouldn't be possible." Mrs. Pangred hurried forward to help Severus feed the medicine, but found that it was still ineffective. She suddenly became anxious. Even after using the spell, Eaton still couldn't drink the potion smoothly. In this case, Eaton was really in danger.

"No, he must be transferred to Saint German immediately." Mrs. Pang Red finally concluded, "If he can't take the medicine, his soul fluctuations will only get more and more intense, and sooner or later it will cause soul damage. If that happens, he will really be beyond help."

"Merlin... that's just a child." McGonagall couldn't help choking up. In her eyes, Eton Prince had always been a good boy who had a good relationship with everyone. Although McGonagall knew that his situation might be a little dangerous during this period, she never thought that such a young child would be hurt so badly. This is Hogwarts! The safest place in the entire wizarding world...

The kind-hearted Hufflepuff Headmaster Popvis couldn't help but turn her head to wipe away her tears secretly. Flitwick, floating in the air, reached out and patted her shoulder with a sigh, "Principal Dumbledore, please send him to St. Gorman's immediately. There is at least a glimmer of hope."

Dumbledore naturally understood this, and he would never let Prince die here. Once Eaton Prince died, it would mean that the Prince family would completely break with the Order of the Phoenix, no matter who did it. After all, he had once guaranteed Eaton's safety to the head of the Prince family, but now he had to break his promise.

"My child, can I send him to St. Gorman's?" Dumbledore came forward and gently persuaded Severus, who seemed to be thinking about something while looking at the potion in his hand, ignoring the outside world.

Severus, who turned a deaf ear to the words, finally pursed his lips and poured the potion into his own mouth. In full view of everyone, he pressed his lips against Eaton's, passed the potion over little by little, and carefully used his tongue to send the potion into Eaton's mouth, forcing the unconscious Eaton to swallow the potion. From time to time, some of the potion flowed slowly down their cheeks along their lips. This trick... was really effective. Eaton drank four extremely cruel potions without knowing it, and suffered with Severus for the first time.

After all the potions were taken, Severus, with a slightly red face, carefully laid Eaton flat on the bed, gently wiped the potion on Eaton's lips, then tucked the quilt in, and then used his sleeve to wipe the potion on his face carelessly, "Mrs. Pangred, I want to stay here with Eaton, is that okay?"

The six stunned adult wizards came to their senses and awkwardly turned their eyes away, looking at the sky, the ground, and the bed, fixing their clothes, their faces, and their hair. Only Mrs. Pang Red showed her professional qualities as a professional medical staff and calmly accepted the situation that she didn't understand just now but now understood its meaning. In her opinion, it was reasonable to get the patient to drink the potion at this time. Going forward to check on Eaton's condition, Mrs. Pang Red was fully aware of the power of the Prince family. The best potions were in dozens!

"The poison has stopped spreading and is slowly fading." He breathed a sigh of relief, but when the gray light radiated from Eaton's body, his heart was raised even higher, "Merlin, why didn't the soul soothing potion work?!"

For a moment, everyone was silent, watching Pang Red use the detection and treatment spells again and again, watching the gray light appear again and again, and the taste in their hearts was added with bitterness again and again.

"Stop." Severus had been watching Eaton with his eyes closed. He grabbed Mrs. Pomread's wrist, which was holding the wand. "I want to take Eaton home, now."

"Mr. Snape, what are you talking about? The patient needs to go to St. Geman's! Only there can he have a glimmer of hope of survival." Pang Red was also a little discouraged, but as a medical staff, she still dutifully reminded him.

"I said I would take him home." Severus said quietly, carefully helping Eaton up, bending over to carry him on his back, his expression became unusually blank and calm, and his eyes were empty.

"Severus, my child, I understand how you feel, but as the headmaster, I must make the best choice. Eton must go to St. Gorman's." Dumbledore stepped forward and blocked Severus' steps. At this time, he also lost his smile, and his blue eyes showed sharpness.

Severus did not raise his head, but glanced sideways at Eaton who was still unconscious. His tone became unusually gentle, as if he was not worried about disturbing Eaton's sleep. "Eaton, shall we go home?"

This scene made the three ladies present feel very sad. They seemed to understand the mood of the child who had just entered school at this moment, despair, deep despair, it was a suffocating emotion, as if the heart stopped beating, as cold as falling into an ice kiln but no one came to save him...The tears that she had just held back flowed down involuntarily, Popvis could not help crying out loud, and hurriedly left the medical room alone. She really could not bear to watch the scene at this moment.

Wasn't Dumbledore sad? Of course not, it was just that he was used to analyzing the pros and cons, used to evaluating the value, but these were not important at the moment. What was important was that he couldn't let the innocent child die. This was not right, so no matter what, he had to send Eaton to St. Geman's, where the medical skills were the best and there was always a way to cure Eaton's illness.

"Hogwarts, stop them." Severus walked around Dumbledore who was about to stop him, and before the other party spoke again, he whispered something that made Dumbledore stunned for a moment, and took this opportunity to slowly walk out of the infirmary.

When Dumbledore and the other professors who were also frightened by the previous remarks were about to chase after him, the side wall of the infirmary suddenly surged, and the only door was replaced by a wall. Soon, a situation of four walls formed around everyone, blocking everyone in the center, forming a circle of encirclement. Until then, Dumbledore and others realized that this Severus Snape... was probably not just a half-blood prince! How could a half-blood wizard, even a prince, command the souls of Hogwarts that even the Dark Lord couldn't find? ! ... What is his relationship with Hogwarts...

A faint light flashed on Dumbledore's glasses. McGonagall and Flitwick also frowned and looked around. Only Slughorn's heart was beating very fast at this time. He swallowed saliva with some difficulty to soothe his dry and burning throat. He swore that he didn't know that Snape had another identity. If he knew, he would never do it! If he knew this, even without the Dark Lord, he would definitely die. Everyone knows that only the real owner of the castle can command the creatures in the castle, not to mention the self-awareness formed by the castle over the past hundred years... Merlin, he must leave Hogwarts before this matter is exposed and hide in a place where no one can find him.

"Albus, that child..." McGonagall wiped the tears from her face with her sleeve, her voice still a little hoarse, "If it's true, Hogwarts might be..."

"I know... yes, I know." Dumbledore muttered, looking at a point on the wall. He was very depressed at this moment. Hogwarts was a fortress full of children. Even if he was a little biased, he had never thought that such a bad thing would happen here. Yes, he understood that someone wanted to kill Eaton again, and Severus was just going to rescue him.

Eaton Prince was not sent to Saint Geman in the end. As a family of top potion masters, they always had a close relationship with the hospital. When Saint Geman's most authoritative soul doctor finally helped Eaton calm down his soul fluctuations, he announced that he was not conscious enough.

"The soul-soothing potion he drank initially was mixed with a little bit of unicorn cursed blood. We all know what this means. It was also his luck that it did not cause the strongest soul shock." He sighed and put away his wand. "He will wake up, but Wharton, I can't tell you when he will wake up."

"...Are you sure?" Wharton clenched his fists and asked in a suppressed tone, "I brewed that potion."

"My old friend, I'm not doubting you." The doctor shook his head with a wry smile, "You understand what I mean, right?"

"...I understand." Wharton stood up and took a last look at Severus, who was quietly staying by Eaton's bed and seemed to be oblivious to their conversation, and sent the healer out.

After the door was closed, Salazar showed up. He was sitting on the other side of the bed, with a trace of struggle in his eyes, but he finally persisted. There was a person who could wake Eaton up. He was the purest white wizard with superb soul magic. He had seen that person saving people too many times. Unfortunately, he was a black wizard with such a physique that he could not do even a little bit of what that person did.

"Go to Hogwarts and do what you should do." Salazar noticed Severus's eyes and softened his heart for some reason. His tone became much softer. "I have a way to save him."

Severus didn't respond for a long time. After a long time, he slowly reached out and carefully touched Eaton's still warm face. Then there was some light in his eyes. "He will be fine, right?"

Eaton is still alive... He is still alive. Severus felt that his frozen heart had finally started beating again. He would not die and would not leave him.

"Even if he wakes up, he may become a person without magic power. Don't you care about this?" Salazar felt that he had to have a new understanding of this child.

"I will always take care of him." Severus stood up and gently kissed Eaton's forehead. After hesitating for a moment, he kissed Eaton's pale lips again. "You like to be alone, but I don't. So wake up quickly and let me accompany you."

...'Are you sure you understand what you are doing?' Salazar raised his eyebrows in amusement. Well, this guy is from his own academy. He knows how to take the initiative and possess his own things. But...Salazar felt that this kid just put on Eaton's lipstick because he didn't like the color of his lips. What can an 11-year-old kid understand...

"I will make them pay." Severus stood up, his eyes became very cold, his embarrassed appearance could not hide his coldness at all, "Tell grandpa to re-seal the manor." 'Eton, you wait for me, wait for me to avenge you, and then, I will always be by your side.'

"I will definitely convey it~" In just a few words, the true friendship in times of trouble made Salazar change his opinion of the boy in black, and he spoke more casually, "Oh, by the way, the man-eating plant in the forbidden forest was brought in by a shameful woman who smelled like an eight-eyed giant spider. Find out who she is, and then..."

"I don't need you to teach me." Severus turned and walked out of the room, leaving behind this sentence. During this time, he did not look at Eaton again. He was afraid to look at Eaton's quiet face as if he was asleep, he would not want to leave. He must avenge Eaton, and he would never forgive anyone who hurt Eaton.

"Heh... well, I used to find you quite annoying, but now, you really have the aura of a Slytherin~right, Eaton?" Salazar turned his head to look at Eaton, who was as quiet as if he didn't exist, "Trust me, you'll wake up soon!" Now all he needs to do is go back to Hogwarts and bring the person he originally planned to never have any contact with again to Prince Manor.


"How could this happen? This shouldn't happen. He should have completely lost consciousness... Merlin, what kind of person have I offended..."

76 House of Another World
Dumbledore tried various ways, but ultimately failed to rescue his group. The infirmary was still surrounded by solid walls. Even after notifying Professor Popvis with the Patronus Charm, he was told that it would be useless outside. And he was not a terrorist, so it was naturally impossible for him to take inappropriate actions such as blasting or blowing up things. As a result, several people were so tired that they paced back and forth in this small space, thinking about their own thoughts. For a moment, no one exchanged ideas.

"Albus, what should we do now?" After an unknown amount of time, Professor McGonagall finally broke the silence. She was worried that if Severus didn't come back to let them out, there would be no professor in tomorrow's class, which would definitely cause an uproar. Now the only hope was Professor Popvis who had already gone out. She hoped that he could find a chance to contact the Prince family, at least to discuss it. Anyway, Severus trapped them because they prevented him from taking Eton Prince back. Now this reason was no longer valid, so at least let them out.

"Wait." Dumbledore, who had experienced the ups and downs of life, was obviously much more open-minded and stable in this regard. At this moment, he became the backbone of everyone present. With him around, they were as stable as a rock and there was no need to be afraid. "We should trust him, McGonagall."

During this time, Dumbledore also thought that if Severus Snape was really one of the contractors of this castle, then their future would be bright. Although the child had a dark heart, he was a child with clear goals and a loving heart. Such a child would not be scary. The only thing he was worried about was that if Eaton, whom the child cared about, really had an accident this time and exhausted all his love, that would be the biggest threat to Hogwarts and even the wizarding world.

Slughorn simply sat on the ground with his back to everyone else. He would rather be trapped than face anyone who might be interested and notice his movements. During the hour that Severus was brewing the potion, he took advantage of no one's attention, dipped his finger in a little unicorn blood, and pretended to accidentally rub it into Prince's mouth. As a potion master, he naturally knew the ingredients of the soul soothing potion, and knew that even a little bit of blood that would not even have any effect on the human body mixed in would cause the soul potion to mutate. This was also his purpose. He needed Severus Snape, this talented but humble student to help him block the darkness ahead. During this time, the gossip about the Prince brothers naturally reached his ears. He knew very well that as long as Eaton Prince died because of this incident, the Prince family would definitely vent their anger on Snape. The aristocratic's so-called compromise for inheritance was absolutely not applicable to the stubborn and protective Prince. He could take this opportunity to win over Snape. This was a very clever plan. The only omission was that he was completely unaware of Snape's other identity. This time, once Snape communicated with Hogwarts, with his talent for potions, he would immediately notice his little move, and then he would be really dead. He had to leave here like a plan, immediately.

"Dumbledore, we have to leave here as soon as possible." Slughorn thought for a moment, then stood up with a serious look on his bloated face. "If no dean shows up for breakfast tomorrow morning, it will surely cause panic, which will be a disaster for Hogwarts. As the master of potions, I tell you that Eton Prince is probably beyond saving, and there is no way Severus Snape will be back in a short time!"

These words made everyone look sideways, but after thinking about it carefully, they all agreed. Mrs. Pangred thought of the poor child, her eyes dimmed and she sighed, feeling very upset that she could not save him. Hogwarts hid such a terrible darkness, and she didn't know how to go on in the future.

"Horace, what do you think?" Dumbledore also sighed, with deep worry and deep hope.

"Blow up this wall."

"Merlin, that's not possible! This is Hogwarts. Not to mention that the sound may cause panic among the students, Hogwarts has a soul and we can't hurt it." Flitwick was the first to object. He had deep feelings for Hogwarts and had been studying the soul of Hogwarts for a long time. He couldn't bear to do that.

"That makes sense. Horace, don't worry, the child won't let us down." Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eyes. This was his earnest hope, and he looked forward to the final result from the bottom of his heart.

Perhaps Merlin felt Dumbledore's sincerity, for as soon as he finished speaking, the thick wall that had been standing still began to move in a familiar rhythm, and under the relieved and surprised looks of the professors, it returned to its original position, revealing the door of the infirmary.

"My Merlin, you finally came out. What happened?" Popvis patted her pounding heart, still in shock. She had been in this state for a long time.

"Let's not talk about it for now. We need to contact Prince as soon as possible."

So, the group hurried to the headmaster's office, except Slughorn, who found an excuse to go back to the common room to check on the situation and went back to the cellar alone. This was the last time they saw Slughorn. Of course, no one had expected this.

The next morning, the Slytherins woke up on time. Soon, they heard exclamations of frustration, panic, and depression from different doors... Their homework... had not been done yet, and it was due today. Merlin, how could they have been so high up chatting and playing last night that they even forgot their homework? ! So, the nobles who were pursuing perfection in no time hurriedly washed their faces, tidied up their appearance, and quickly went out to find familiar Ravenclaws... Which bastard headmaster stipulated that every Ravenclaw should have a time-turner? !

Severus also appeared at the breakfast table, but the gloomy and depressing feeling around him was even stronger. Everyone involuntarily moved away from him, and only Sirius, who was relatively calm, came close to him.

"Severus, tell me the truth, do you also feel something is wrong?" He glanced around and saw that no one paid attention to this corner, so he asked quietly, "Something must have happened last night, but I don't remember anything. Don't look at me, I just know it!"

Sirius's beast instinct was quite useful. He knew that it was impossible for him to get along so well with other Slytherins to the point where he didn't even do his homework. The only explanation was that what he received were false memories. But he was clearly wearing the Black family's defensive jewelry, which was used to resist these messy spells, so he couldn't figure it out.

"Go to Gryffindor." Severus' eyes fell on the empty Slytherin headmaster's seat, and an unknown light flashed in his eyes, but he said something completely unrelated, "With your troll brain, you will never figure it out."

Sirius couldn't help but puff up his face when he heard that, and looked at Severus seriously with a frown. He could hear the seriousness in the words, but he could hear even more the trace of blood and darkness that was absolutely unmistakable, that was what he was most familiar with, having been exposed to it since he was a child!

But Severus refused to pay attention to anyone anymore. He immersed himself in his own world again and refused anyone to get into his heart.

Visual transformation...

Eaton felt miserable. He had been able to control himself well before and had never made any mistakes. But this time, he had exceeded his limit too much. In the moment when he was hit by the backlash and fell into darkness, he actually thought about whether Severus would be sad or go to extremes? ! How insensitive is he to his own feelings? ! He hadn't figured it out for so long, and now he had figured it out but couldn't express it. Is there anyone more miserable than him? Um, Severus, where are you...

Looking at the familiar surroundings, Eaton sighed, and finally couldn't help himself. He reached into his own body and felt it. Hmm, it felt similar to Peeves, but very different from a ghost. Sure enough, his body should still be alive. Maybe he could float to Prince Manor to take a look? But the problem was...

Eaton's sight fell on the young version of Sever who was being beaten but refused to say a word. This was the scene he saw when he just regained consciousness. When he instinctively rushed over to resist, he found that the violent man's fist went straight through his body and landed on the boy again and again, unaware of his existence. The boy's eyes had never changed from beginning to end, and he had been staring blankly into the distance. It was not until then that Eaton realized something was wrong. This child who looked very similar to his Sever looked at least 8 or 9 years old, even though he was as thin as a 5 or 6-year-old, his face was pale and lifeless.

In the following time, he learned that the boy was also called Severus Snape, that he and his Severus had the same mother and father, that he had been secretly looking at the little beauty with red hair and green eyes, and only then would there be a little light in his eyes, that he would steal, rob and work, just for that bite of black bread, that he was bullied by the children around him until the magic rioted... He also learned that Irene secretly forgot all those terrified children who screamed "devils and monsters", but refused to help her son at all.

If Eaton didn't understand at this moment, he would not be the think tank of the mercenary group. This is probably the world where he did not appear, and Severus had never met his Severus. Even so, even if he knew that this Sever was different from his Severus, he still felt distressed. He tried every possible way to help this Severus who had suffered so much, but he was still powerless. He could only sit by his side and accompany him when Severus sat in the dark corner licking his wounds alone, hugging him as before, and patting his back gently, even if the other party could not feel anything... maybe he could feel it? Many times he watched Severus suddenly raise his eyes and look around, even rubbing everywhere, and finally dimmed his eyes, lowered his head again, and shrank into the corner again, which made Eaton feel more pity... 'Why did I see such a miserable Severus just when I discovered my feelings for Severus? Is there any justice, law, or Merlin...'

In this way, Eaton accompanied little Sever as he grew up day by day, watched him impulsively go to the red-haired beauty and say "wizard" to her, which made her angry, watched him smile for this girl, brightened his dark eyes that were always filled with gloom, watched him fall day by day, and waited in the corner of the empty square day by day for the girl to come. ...Hmm, Lily Evans, the number one rival in love seems to be...

When Severus stepped onto the train to Hogwarts for the first time, he was excited and thrilled. Even though he was wearing tattered clothes and holding worn-out books in his hands, and even though he felt the contemptuous looks of others, Eaton could not help but be happy for him. Floating beside Severus, Eaton sighed a little, and he couldn't tell why. Maybe it was because his Severus's attention was on him, making him no longer obsessed with Hogwarts, but Eaton felt that he really liked those eyes that sparkled with expectation, yearning, obsession and true joy... When he went back, he had to make his Severus happy from the bottom of his heart. Maybe he could try to confess his feelings?

The subsequent 'prince's' arrogant provocation, 'princess''s' insincere defense, the crowd's support, verbal insults, sharp counterattacks and the gloomy but forbearing pursed lips after failure, Eaton as a bystander felt sorry for Severus. Lily Evans looked down on the poor and gloomy boy. Her actions were just to show her self-righteous justice and mercy. Although Eaton understood the girl's thoughts and actions, and understood Severus's feelings of treating the girl like driftwood, it did not mean that he would not be angry... Sure enough, it was not enough to just drug James? Oh, right, hum, I wonder how the person who dared to call his Sever a snotlout would feel when he found out that he would never be able to fly in the sky? Oh, it's a pity not to see it...

For seven whole years, Eaton followed Severus closely, accompanying him through one cold night after another, Severus sitting alone in the corner of the dormitory to heal his wounds after being bullied by the Gryffindor quartet, Severus being secretly beaten up by Slytherin but not being able to tell anyone, Severus being immersed in the world of potions, Severus being exhausted when he learned that his parents had both passed away, Severus being caught off guard by the platinum peacock's various words and instilling bad thoughts, Severus being excited because he thought he had found a goal to strive for, Severus being terrified and desperate when he almost became a victim of a werewolf, Severus being with Lily because of Severus, who broke up due to disagreements and tore open his wounds, but then regretted it and found it was useless. Severus, who became a Death Eater reserve but suddenly became confused... Severus with so many sides made Eaton's heart gradually calm down. This was a world without him. He clearly realized that if he had not been resurrected in that body, his Severus would have encountered so many misfortunes, the feeling of having no one to accompany him on a bumpy journey, the feeling of having to grope his way through a tortuous road but no one to provide the slightest help, the feeling of being rebuked when he thought he had found a way out but went against the only light in his heart... 'Hey, my Severus, I will always be with you, okay? '

At graduation, Severus stood in the dormitory where he had lived for seven years, silently packing his luggage. After taking a final look around the dormitory, he hesitated for a moment, then hesitantly opened his mouth, "I don't know who you are, or what you are, but you will always be with me, right?"

Eaton didn't know how to answer. He subconsciously knew that he was being asked. Even though he knew that the other party couldn't hear him, Eaton still decided not to answer. What he wanted was his Siver. What he was waiting for was Siver to return to his body and embrace him. If he could choose, he would naturally not stay here, but the problem was that he had no choice now. This was not his world. However, as long as he was here, he would be with him for a day, and this would never change.

"What am I talking about? Have I been infected by the troll too?" Severus' eyes dimmed and he murmured self-blame. He really thought that the warmth he felt around his body on those lonely nights was brought to him by an unknown existence, which started before he entered school, so he secretly looked up a lot of information but did not find any similar cases.

In the end, he still carried his luggage and left Hogwarts step by step. Accompanied by Eaton, he accepted the Death Eater Mark left by the Dark Lord.

This was the first time Eaton had seen this Voldemort... I have to say, he was really ugly, his eyes were like slits, his skin looked like it had been burned, and his nose was even more amazing, with two nostrils showing. This aesthetic was unique, and it would take thousands of years for such a thing to appear! Those nobles who usually boasted of their nobility were willing to lower their expensive heads to kiss the robes that touched the ground? Merlin, this world is so fantastic, even more ridiculous than Mars hitting the Earth. Let Salazar deal with that guy later, he is not interested in dealing with aliens. ...Speaking of Salazar...He could only sigh, the Salazar of this world had already disappeared in the Hogwarts magic circle, what a sin...

Everything that happened next was even more fantastical to Eaton. It was such a coincidence that Severus was asked to brew soul potions constantly, but he never appeared in the Death Eaters' potion box, but Voldemort became energetic. It was such a coincidence that Severus was caught drinking and heard a very deceptive prophecy, and the second half of it was closely related to Voldemort. It was such a coincidence that the savior in the prophecy was determined to be born by the girl who always stayed in Severus' heart, and Voldemort, who was even more deceptive, chose this child to attack. It was such a coincidence that Severus secretly asked Dumbledore for help, but he pushed the responsibility away without any delay and agreed to the exchange. A few days later, the girl died of frustration. What was even more coincidental was that the girl actually knew how to use black magic to sacrifice herself to her son? ! After the whole thing, Eaton felt so frustrated that he floated in front of the decadent Severus and scolded him. Damn, he couldn't see such a huge trap, is he still from Slytherin?! After venting to the end, seeing Severus in despair and drinking, he still softened his heart and hugged him as usual, patting his back, listening to him crying softly and constantly repeating the name of the beautiful girl... After returning, he must immediately separate his Severus and the noisy Gryffindor girl.

For many years afterwards, Severus served as the Head of Slytherin at Hogwarts. He never laughed or cried again. He spoke ill of his students and was extremely biased towards grades. His ascetic life would only bring a little brightness back when he was brewing potions. Until the savior entered school, the Philosopher's Stone, the Chamber of Secrets, the Horcruxes, and rebirth, Eaton silently watched Severus moving precariously on the edge of danger, watching him protect the only child of his beloved girl even though he hated her to death. This was the only belief he had left, the motivation that kept him alive.

"What about me, Dumbledore? What about my soul?" Severus' slightly excited and confused words made Eaton want to cry. How many years has it been since he last cried? Severus... Why can't there be something bright in his life? What about his Severus? He just couldn't help thinking that if he didn't show up, this was his Severus. How could he bear to endure such great pain? !

Finally, everything settled down in the place where he was almost bitten by a werewolf and was therefore considered to be hated by Severus. Eaton smiled, because Severus saw him. In the second before his soul dissipated, the surprise and surprise in that second made those black eyes become unusually beautiful. Eaton reached out and touched the light that kept dissipating. That was Severus' soul, a pure white soul immersed in darkness but never able to show its beauty. It accompanied him throughout his life. Eaton had already automatically and consciously transformed this Severus into his Severus...

At the moment when Severus' soul completely dissipated, Eaton felt a dizziness that was both strange and familiar. As the darkness came again, he was looking forward to seeing his Severus again when he woke up.

The boy lying on the white bed in the closed room of Prince Manor was as quiet as ever. Severus gently wiped Eaton's body bit by bit with a towel, and then massaged him seriously, as if he was treating a treasure in his hand.

"How is my grandson today?" Wharton had actually been standing at the door, but he didn't say anything to disturb him until Severus covered Eaton with a blanket.

"Very good." Severus said briefly, casting a spell to empty the basin.

"Uh, I'm sorry... I couldn't..." A handsome man with blond hair and green eyes smiled awkwardly, looking at Salazar next to him in a flattering way, but found that the other party was as indifferent as always, so he could only close his mouth in embarrassment.

"Don't mention your incompetence to me again." Severus' voice was extremely cold. "You will disturb Eaton's rest here, please go out."

Gettler sighed. It has been three years. How much can change in three years? At least he didn't recognize Severus now. Compared with the awkward but emotional student in the past, this Severus has no emotions. Those emotions have gone with Eaton's unconsciousness. Although the things that happened three years ago were finally revealed, what did it matter if they were solved? Severus still firmly refused to return to Prince and expelled himself. Everyone knew what he wanted to do, but he was just a Voldemort who was not the heir of Slytherin. Why should he risk everything? But no one could understand the child's mind...

"Severus, I will not agree to you leaving the Prince family. I am informing you as your grandfather to stop what you are doing now! Promise in front of Eaton." Wharton did not want to force Severus like this. Everyone knew that Eaton was not dead, but it was not clear when he would wake up. Wharton did not resent Severus, but he finally let it go. He hated Severus and raised him since childhood. How could he not feel sorry for him?

Severus pursed his lips and stood there stubbornly, refusing to speak. Everyone remained in a stalemate... until...

"Sev...what have you done again..."

77 House of Sweetness
Severus did not move. Even though everyone rushed to the bed, he still stood there without moving. His hands clenched into fists involuntarily, hidden under the sleeves of his robe. He felt that he had returned to his dreams every night, where Eaton always opened his eyes and looked at him quietly, but when he wanted to reach out and hug him, everything turned into glass fragments, piercing him all over and scarred his heart. So, slowly, he no longer believed, no longer listened, but just stood quietly not far away, looking at Eaton, tenderly, painfully, venting the deepest thoughts in his heart.

"Eton, how do you feel? Hmm? Tell grandpa if you feel uncomfortable anywhere." Wharton didn't dare to touch him, so he could only ask anxiously. He took out his magic wand and performed the most basic test, which showed that everything was normal... So his grandson was really awake? ? ? Well, he didn't really believe it...囧

"Let me do it." The blond handsome guy waved his fingers like dancing, and colorful colors penetrated into Eaton's body under his nimble fingers, "Huh, it's okay, it's okay. Everything is normal." After saying that, he looked at Salazar expectantly, trying to get a little praise there, but the result was naturally counterproductive.

"In that case, you are not needed here, leave immediately." Salazar sent the guest away without any hesitation. If it weren't for the fact that Eaton needed this person, he would never allow the other person to stay in his sight for even a second.

"Salazar..." The blond handsome guy... Godric Gryffindor murmured Salazar's name in a sad voice. He himself should not be forgiven, but he waited for so many years to finally get the chance to see Salazar again. How could he give up so easily? A thousand years ago, he was the one who listened to one side and believed it, which led to the breakup between the two and broke Salazar's heart, but what about him? Wasn't he sad? Wasn't he upset? He even thought about finding Salazar, taking a last look at him and then committing suicide, but there was nothing, nothing... Until now, everything was so new, which even made him begin to believe that he and Salazar could start over. He knew that Salazar would not easily trust him again, just because he had betrayed him once before, but he still had a chance, didn't he?

"Please call me Slytherin, Gryffindor." Salazar didn't even look at Eden, and put his hand on Eden's forehead. "There is a limit to your ability, Eden."

Although Eaton's body was a little stiff, he was still able to move on his own, which was enough to show how well Severus did his massage. Reaching out and pulling down Salazar's hand, Eaton did not answer him. Instead, he looked at the stiff body with its back facing him from beginning to end. "Severus, won't you look back at me? Come here."

Eaton was eager to hug Severus. He had witnessed the death of the professor, which made him still immersed in the sadness. He had to make sure that his Severus was still fine and stayed by his side for a long time.

Severus' body trembled for a while, and then he slowly turned around, looking down at the ground, as if thinking for a long time, and then he walked towards Eaton's bed step by step. The other three people in the room had already left the bed, except Salazar. When he reached the bed, Severus stood there and didn't move, like a wooden stake, which made Eaton feel angry and funny. He didn't believe that he was still alive. Was he awake? !

Seeing Severus like this, Eaton couldn't help laughing. It would be strange if he wasn't happy that his Severus cared about him so much! He climbed up with his stiff and somewhat uncontrollable body, refused Salazar's help, and hugged Severus. This action made the body that had been propped up with great difficulty fall back onto the bed... Then everything became Severus pressing on Eaton on the bed... cough.

Well, Wharton and Gettler's thoughts were somewhat inconsistent, and they found excuses to find potions and ask for St. Germain's healer, and then left in a hurry. The person they had been worried about had woken up, and everything would develop in a better direction. They were not in a hurry to reunite... Anyway, they saw that Eaton didn't want to pay attention to them at all... It's easy to get struck by lightning if you disturb the couple's time, so it's better to leave some private space for the young couple. So, the two elderly people who were powerful outside but childish inside ran away without any psychological burden.

Godric seemed to want to pull Salazar away, but he didn't dare. He could only stand there and move his eyes involuntarily.

Severus remained motionless for a long time. Eaton held him and patted his back gently for a long time. The zombie-like body in his arms slowly softened and began to struggle slightly. Eaton increased the strength of the pat as punishment, "Be quiet, let me hold you for a while..."

Salazar sighed, and finally let Eaton be willful. God knows, Eaton's body could not withstand much pressure at this time. Fortunately, Sever knew to support the bed with his hands and did not let his body press on Eaton.

"I'll be back in half an hour." After saying that, he walked out of the room, and Godric followed him out of the room.

After everyone left, Eaton struggled to kick the quilt away, and then motioned to Severus to get on the bed. After the other party hesitated for a while and finally did it, Eaton got the opportunity to hug Severus quietly, holding him against his shoulder. The first thing he saw when he woke up was Severus as he wished, but that back figure overlapped with the man whose soul had accompanied him all his life. Sadness, anger, unwillingness, stubbornness, Eaton didn't know to what extent Severus had pushed him during the time he was away, but he couldn't help but feel heartbroken.

"You don't believe I'm back, huh?" Eaton asked the kid who was buried in his arms and refused to look up, "You've grown a lot taller. How long have I been away?"

"...3 years." After an unknown amount of time, the patient Eaton finally got a soft answer.

"So long... no wonder I missed you so much." Eaton nodded seriously, touched the top of Severus' head with his face, rolled his eyes, and lowered his head to kiss him.

Eaton was very keen to notice that the body in his arms had stiffened again. He wanted to laugh, but his heart was still heavy and he didn't feel relieved at all. This time Severus softened quickly. Not long after, his red face struggled out of Eaton's arms, "I... miss you too."

This time the voice was even softer, as if it would disappear with a gust of wind. But Eaton saw the light in Severus' eyes as he wished, which made him dazed, and then he immediately came back to his senses, holding Severus in his arms again, but his brows knitted involuntarily.

He knew the difference between his Siver and the miserable professor. In that world, he was just a bystander. This Siver was the one he liked and the one who was willing to open his heart to him. Thinking of this, he suppressed the experience of that long time in the lowest part of his heart. Maybe there was a place where he felt sorry for the professor, but he would not feel sad for him.

"You haven't answered me yet, what bad things have you done? Did you do something to let me down while I was away?!" Eaton wanted Sever to return to his original state and stop being immersed in the world of sadness. Therefore, any doubts were justified.

Especially... This question, Eaton really wanted to know the answer. That noisy girl from Gryffindor had been coveting his Severus for a long time. It was hard to guarantee that there hadn't been some love at first sight or love at second sight during this period. Well, it was strangled in the cradle. Severus' face seemed to be even redder, his eyes were a little moist, and his lips moved but he didn't say anything.

"Hey, you're not really going to do anything to let me down, are you?" Eaton raised his eyebrows.

Severus frowned, and suddenly regained his stern expression. Although his red cheeks and watery eyes remained the same, this did not hinder Eaton's appreciation. "A person who has been lying down for three years has no right to say such things! Is your brain from a troll?!

You dare anyone to approach you, without even wearing any defensive jewelry, do you think you are Merlin in the next life? Even if you were Merlin, you couldn't save your hopeless and overflowing Gryffindor love!"

Well... Sifu, don't you think it's unreliable to say such things while you're in someone's arms with your head held high? Of course, Eaton wouldn't remind him.

"I was wrong." Eaton made the promise quite straightforwardly. "I didn't expect a dean of a college to do such a thing. Was it because I was careless, because I failed to supervise, because I was too sloppy, or because I was not good at academics?"

Severus, who wanted to continue preaching, could only grit his teeth and purse his lips when he heard this, staring with wide eyes, trying to stare until Eaton stopped smiling, "This is not a funny thing." He gritted his teeth, really.

Eaton sighed, and fulfilled his wish by leaning over and kissing Severus on the forehead, then moving down to his straight nose. "I'm smiling because I finally see my Severus again. Shouldn't I smile when I'm happy? Well, you should smile too."

Severus was a little dazed after being kissed, his brain was in a chaotic state, and he felt dizzy. He didn't hear Eaton's question for a while. In Eaton's smiling eyes, he began to be dazed... for the first time in his life.

As for love, the children of Slytherin are very precocious, especially in the past three years. Lucius, who has been pestering Severus all the time, has already been flooded with peach blossoms. But Severus is like a piece of wood, turning a blind eye to everything and concentrating on doing his own thing. Therefore, he doesn't feel anything about the pink bubbles around him, and naturally has not read anything like "The Secret of Puberty". As elders, Wharton and Gettler would not make such an inappropriate move as giving a book as a gift under such circumstances. God knows if they did so, would this gloomy little guy be furious and chase them down just for wasting his precious time?

So, the result is that this poor kid Severus doesn't know what love is yet... but he knows that his heart is beating faster, he feels weak all over, his mood is high, his emotions are high, his body is hot, and he is sweating... Could it be that he is sick?

    Xiao Hai looked at Xiao Fan: "My dear grandson, you are merciless to the enemy."

    Xiao Fan said in a deep voice: "Grandpa, treat the enemy as cruelly and ruthlessly as the severe winter. Before showing mercy to foreigners, let them know that they cannot mess with the Dragon Empire."

    Xiao Hai nodded: "My dear grandson, I will do as you say."

    "Anyway, if there is trouble, it will be your business in the future."

    "When the spirit cave allows, you should hurry up and send it over."

    Xiao Fan laughed: "Grandpa, you should clean up the mess first. It's a mess, and it's not easy for me to deal with it."

    Xiao Hai said: "The White Elephant Empire can be dealt with by Grandpa, but the Vulture Empire may not be so easy to deal with."

    "Grandpa, speaking of this, there may be restrictions on sending warships over in the future."

    Xiao Fan frowned.

    Xiao Hai was not surprised. He said: "Some people from the Vulture Empire should have arrived there. Have they taken action?"

    "The prime minister and others have discussed that the Vulture Empire cannot tolerate China sending all kinds of warships over without scruples."

    "China...did many people die?"

    Xiao Hai looked very solemn when he said the latter.

    Xiao Fan shook his head: "No, they killed thousands of people in Dongyang Country, and the Ghost Society was destroyed by them."

    "They used this to threaten China."

    Xiao Hai was stunned, and after a while he said: "The guy teleported by the Vulture Empire is a talent."

    "He can come up with such a crazy idea." "

    My dear grandson, I think he is a bit like you in this respect."

    Xiao Fan: "..."

    It feels like this is not a compliment to him!

    But there is no way, who asked Xiao Hai to be his grandfather? Can't afford to offend.

    "Did the negotiation have any results?"

    Xiao Hai asked.

    Xiao Fan shook his head: "The negotiation ended unpleasantly. Grandpa, have you prepared a spirit beast? Send another spirit beast over."

    "Increasing our deterrence ability is conducive to negotiations."

    Xiao Hai nodded: "You go and open the spirit cave channel."

    Soon Xiao Fan opened the spirit cave channel, and soon Xiao Hai teleported another spirit beast, still a dog.

    The dog's nose is more sensitive, obedient, and has good combat effectiveness.

    "My dear grandson, I can't send you the space ability bead this time."

    Xiao Hai said.

    Transmitting a martial king-level spirit beast consumed a lot of energy.

    Xiao Fan smiled and said, "Grandpa, my current strength is sufficient and my strength is increasing quickly. It will not be so convenient to transmit here in the future." "

    I will transmit the things in the warehouse to you."

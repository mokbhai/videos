 Faced with Li Yu’s sword and Gu Caiwei’s gaze, he had no other choice.
     

 “I… will stop the spell!” Qing Ye closed his eyes in despair and said with a sorrowful expression.
 …
 In the Immortal Martial World, a strange power constantly devoured everyone’s vitality.
 Countless unwilling human cultivators were still attempting to destroy the giant tree, but they returned empty-handed.
 Many greater demons even spontaneously organized to attack the towering trees growing in the Grand Desolate Forest and the Black Mist Mountain Range, hoping to stop everything.
 However, the giant tree hanging in the sky was like the door to hell, constantly devouring the entire world and taking everyone’s lives.
 The end of the world had already arrived. Death was incomparably real and clear in front of them. They could not escape or break free.
 Be it men, women, young, old, young, rich, poor, birds, beasts, flowers, and trees…
 All that awaited them was death.
 At this moment, everyone fell into deep despair.
 At the border of the Great Sui Dynasty, the two armies that were fighting had already thrown down their weapons and rushed to their countries.
 They wanted to reunite with their families before they died. Even if they could not return, they wanted to die on the land they were familiar with.
 In the imperial capital, two young men hugged their heads and cried.
  They had just become sworn brothers not long ago, and they had set up their grand wish to die on the same day.
 They did not expect their wish to come true so soon!
 On the street, a miserly merchant broke down. He hugged a box filled with gold, silver, and treasures and sat paralyzed in the middle of the road. As he threw out gold, silver, and jewelry, he wailed to the sky, “Oh heavens, I’m willing to spend all my wealth. Please let us off!”
 At the door of a restaurant by the street, two burly men with rough faces stood side by side. One of them said earnestly, “Ah Gang, I’ve always wanted to tell you something, but I didn’t have the courage in the past.
 “Do you know why I haven’t had any children after being married to Little Cui for so many years? Because the person I like is actually you!”
 Ah Gang: “…”
 In a residence in the east of the city, a young and beautiful woman walked to the bed of an old man and said, “Master, I have a secret that I have to tell you now!”
 “Actually, Lu Mao isn’t your son. He’s the son of Lord Wang next door! I’m sorry, but you won’t have any descendants in this life!”
    
Chapter 216: May the Sea of Flowers Bloom Again (3)
 “I originally planned to bring this secret into the coffin, but now that the end of the world has arrived, none of us can escape. I think we should let you die in peace! It was not in vain for you to marry me back then!”
 “You, you!” The old man was so angry that his entire body was trembling. However, he was already sick and bedridden and did not have much time left. Now that the vitality in his body had been devoured, he was even weaker and did not even have the strength to speak.
 “Help, help!” He shouted with difficulty. However, the servants had already fled.
 The remaining few were already lying on the ground in despair, waiting for death.
 No one listened to his orders.
 In a farmhouse in the outskirts of the city, a terrified woman leaned on her husband’s shoulder as tears streamed down her face. The man comforted her softly.
 His six-year-old son did not know what was going on. He looked at his father and asked, “Dad, Mom said that we would all die. What will happen if we die?”
  “If you die, you’ll sleep forever!” The man patted the boy’s head and smiled.
 “Will you dream then?” the boy asked again.
 “Yes, and it will always be a beautiful dream. There will be no nightmares. In the dream, Dad and Mom will be with you. We will live in a world where there is plenty of good food and fun. We will be carefree, have no illnesses, and have no deaths. We will be happy together forever!”
 “Really? That’s great. As long as I can be with my parents, I’m not afraid of anything!”
     

 In a certain sect.
 “Master, is there really no hope? Can we only wait for death?”
 
 “Unless a miracle occurs!”
 Before he finished his sentence, the world shook. The enormous ancient tree that was hanging in the sky suddenly disappeared slowly. It was as if dark clouds had dispersed, and sunlight instantly enveloped the earth.
 The life-devouring power disappeared as well. The entire world seemed to have instantly returned to heaven from hell.
 …
 In the only remaining oasis in the Flower Realm, after Qing Ye stopped his spell, he formed a few complicated hand seals.
 At the same time, golden light flourished around him as his body began to become illusory.
 Upon seeing this, Gu Caiwei’s expression changed as she cried out, “Qing Ye, no!”
 “Realm Master, I’m sorry. I can’t protect you and the Flower Realm anymore. I hope that my life can buy you and the Flower Realm more time.”
 “Although I don’t know what the future holds, I hope that one day, the sea of flowers in the Flower Realm can bloom again!”
     

 With that, Qing Ye closed his eyes.
 He seemed to see the Flower Realm that was once filled with life.
 It was as if he saw himself as a child, running on the grass without any worries and flying above the sea of flowers.
 A blissful smile slowly surfaced on his lips, but his body became increasingly illusory.
 In the end, it turned into countless light spots that scattered to the surrounding ground.
 In an instant, the trees that were about to wither in the distance slowly regained their vitality. Green grass grew on the originally dry ground, and many flowers bloomed in the oasis.
 “Qing Ye!” Gu Caiwei knelt on the ground, her tears falling like rain. She looked at the light spots that filled the sky in grief, and her heart felt like it was being stabbed by a knife.
 Qing Ye was a living being born with the Flower Realm.
  He had existed for countless years. He was like the guardian of the Flower Realm, silently guarding this land and all the living beings in it.
 Now, he had used his hundreds of millions of years of cultivation to turn it into vitality to give life to the dying Flower Realm.
 No one knew how long this energy could support the existence of the Flower Realm.
 However, he still protected the home he loved until the last moment of his life.
 Li Yu looked at everything that was happening and sighed endlessly in his heart.
 This was the first time he respected an enemy from the bottom of his heart, and it was also the first time he did not feel any joy after winning.
 Even though he had obtained a lot of experience points from this mission, he still could not feel happy.
 There was no winning or losing in this!
    
Chapter 217: Waking Up To Women (1)
 Qing Ye’s death gave the Flower Realm a chance to breathe again, and it also announced the end of the calamity he had caused.
 The demon race had paid a painful price for their ambition and greed. Ninety percent of the demon experts were from the Azure Dragon Race, the Nine-Headed Lion Race, the Golden Feather Race, the Phoenix Bird Race, and other large demon races.
 It was all because he had fused with the so-called immortal seed back then and became a ‘tree person’ in this calamity, becoming a sacrifice for the ritual.
 The various demons instantly fell from their former altar into the abyss.
 The strength of the race was less than ten percent, and they could not even compare to some ordinary demons.
 Of course, the human Holy Lands had also suffered heavy losses. When the various Holy Lands fought the demons, they had lost at least half of their combat strength. As for their wealth, it was even greater.
 Although the calamity was over, the scars left behind in this world needed time to heal.
  Fortunately, life was like wild grass. Even if it had been burnt by a fire, there would definitely be fresh grass and flowers everywhere one day.
 Furthermore, those who had experienced this calamity and walked through the gates of hell seemed to understand the meaning of life better. The cowardly understood courage, while the narrow-minded became calm.
 The joy of surviving the calamity temporarily dispersed the pain and gloom in people’s hearts, allowing more people to see the beauty of the sun and believe in miracles.
 “Qingyun, Caiwei, I was foolish back then. Although I can’t make up for my mistake now, I still want to apologize to the two of you!” Perfected Qing Xiao said sincerely before bowing deeply.
 Perfected Qing Xiao felt guilty towards Li Qingyun and Gu Caiwei from the bottom of his heart.
     

 
 Furthermore, judging from the current situation, as the master of the Flower Realm, Gu Caiwei had the ability and opportunity to destroy the entire human Holy Land countless times.
 However, she did not do that, even though the various Holy Lands treated her as a flower demon and wanted to get rid of her as soon as possible.
 Perfected Taiqing had a complicated expression. He wanted to step forward and say something, but he could not say it in the end.
 No one knew that he had once encountered Gu Caiwei in the past and fallen in love with that indescribably beautiful, kind, and lively woman.
 It was a pity that he was not as brave as Li Qingyun and dared to express his love.
 He was not as lucky as Li Qingyun to win Gu Caiwei’s heart.
 Furthermore, he had just become the Holy Lord at the time and cherished his status more than Li Qingyun. He hid all his feelings, so no one knew his true feelings for Gu Caiwei.
 It was also because of this that he was jealous of Li Qingyun for daring to love and hate. He was jealous that Li Qingyun could experience a passionate love with Gu Caiwei. He was jealous that Li Qingyun was braver and more carefree than him.
 Therefore, he was blinded by greed and agreed to the Divine Firmament Holy Land’s request to frame Gu Caiwei and eliminate her.
 He did kill her in name, but because of his personal feelings, he chose to capture her and suppress her in the Demon Sealing Tower.
 Everything was karma. Perhaps it was not as bad as back then. .Perhaps the Holy Land being more tolerant of Gu Caiwei back then would not make her hostile and wary of the Holy Land.
 He would not allow Qing Ye to take advantage of the Holy Land’s reputation to destroy the entire Immortal Martial World.
 Everything that happened today was karma. Everyone had suffered the karma they had planted in the past.
     

 Perfected Taiqing could only choose to seal all his emotions in his heart forever, even though he now knew that Gu Caiwei was not a demon but a flower god.
 “You guys can leave!” Gu Caiwei said sadly.
 She did not want to hear apologies, nor did she need them to apologize. She only wanted to stay here alone and guard the home that Qing Ye had exchanged his life for.
 “Let’s leave!” Perfected Tian Hui said. He knew that it was unnecessary to say anything now. They could only bear their own fruits and heal their own wounds.
 “Caiwei!” Li Qingyun wanted to stay behind and accompany Gu Caiwei. He knew that Qing Ye’s death must have been a huge blow to her.
 “You should leave too. Leave me alone!” Gu Caiwei said.
 Li Qingyun nodded and did not say anything else. He followed everyone out of the Flower Realm.
 After leaving the Flower Realm, everyone parted ways. There was a lot of mess to deal with, and they did not have the time to sigh.
 Dao Yanzi decided to return to the Immortal Domain first and report the situation here to the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect.
  Meanwhile, Li Yu brought his junior brothers and followed Li Qingyun to the Qingyun Sect.
 Li Qingyun remained silent along the way, and everyone’s hearts seemed heavy.
 “Dad, you’re amazing!” Li Yu was the first to break the silence. He knew that his father must be feeling complicated, so he decided to comfort him.
 “Of course not. If only I had half of your strength back then, so many tragic things wouldn’t have happened today!” Li Qingyun smiled bitterly.
 “You want to help the Flower Realm, right?” Li Yu asked.
 “Of course. If the Flower Realm is destroyed, your Aunt Caiwei will die. She has already died once in my life. I can’t see her die a second time!” Li Qingyun said with extreme melancholy.
 “But if you have my strength, how do you plan to help her?” Li Yu asked.
 “I heard from her that the Heaven Mending Stone and the power of the world’s origin can repair and reshape the Flower Realm! If you want to obtain the world’s origin, you need to reach the Holy Lord realm. Only then can you absorb the world’s origin energy from the Chaos Void and condense it into the true world’s origin. As for the Heaven Mending Stone, it’s something that can only be chanced upon by luck. It’s said that it once appeared in the crack of the Ten Worlds in the Chaotic Star Domain!” Li Qingyun explained.
    
Chapter 218: Waking Up To Women (2)
 “World origin? I have that!” Li Yu replied with a smile. He had just obtained world origin power from the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 “Really?” Li Qingyun’s eyes brightened, and his gloomy face immediately brightened up.
 “Of course, but I don’t have the Heaven Mending Stone. However, Dad, you have to believe in miracles. I brought back a lot of treasures and opportunities for you this time. Although I might not necessarily let you have half of my strength, I should be able to give you the strength to protect the Flower Realm!” Li Yu hugged his father and grinned.
 As a transmigrator, Li Yu knew that he had possessed an abandoned baby the moment he arrived in this world.
 Therefore, he had long known that he and Li Qingyun were not blood-related. However, this also gave him a more harmonious and intimate relationship with Li Qingyun.
 On the contrary, it would reduce the generation gap between his father and his son and increase their friendship.
 After Li Yu broke the silence, he began to talk to Li Qingyun about his time in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
  Although the Genius Excellence Rankings had already exposed a lot of content, it was only a small portion of what Li Yu had experienced.
 The atmosphere slowly eased up as they chatted. Tang Chi started the conversation while everyone began to speak.
 As they chatted, everyone returned to the Qingyun Sect.
 The disciples of the sect were pleasantly surprised to see Li Yu and the others return.
 They had guessed that Li Yu would return and turn the tide to end all of this.
     

 Now that they saw Li Yu return, they were more certain of their guess, and they were naturally overjoyed.
 
 Cheers instantly resounded through the entire mountain peak. Countless new disciples finally saw Li Yu’s true appearance, and they were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes.
 In the crowd, Lu Li stared at Li Yu with a burning gaze. The moment she saw him, it was as if a bolt of lightning had struck her heart. Electricity instantly rushed from her heart to her entire body, making her feel numb.
 She had seen various elites and extraordinary people in the Immortal Domain, although she had never seen the divine sons of those ancient families and top orthodoxies.
 However, in her opinion, she could never compare to Li Yu.
 Even if she had never seen Li Yu before, even if no one told her who he was, she locked onto Li Yu in the crowd at a glance and confirmed that he was the person she wanted to know.
 This was the owner of that human body.
 “This trip was worth it!” Lu Li said with a sweet smile.
 After returning to the sect, Li Yu and Li Qingyun arrived at the sect master hall. He gave Li Qingyun the treasures he had obtained and asked for his opinion on the distribution of the various treasures.
 Li Qingyun left behind the Heaven Earth Dao Fruit, sacred medicines, immortal pills, five paragon bones, the Roc Blood Soul, the essence of the Ancestral Magus Di Jiang, and the Primordial Chaos Qi.
 “Give the blood essence of the Responding Dragon to the purple lightning flood dragon! The blood essence of Zhurong is for Wu Chang. As for the rest, you can distribute them freely. I’ll leave this Pan Emperor’s Life Dagger and the Hunyuan Calabash for now! You can keep the rest for now!” Li Qingyun said.
 “Oh yes, Yu’er, I have two things to tell you,” Li Qingyun added.
 Li Yu looked at Li Qingyun as if he was all ears.
     

 “First, I’m preparing to change the sect’s name recently. It’s too tacky now and doesn’t match our temperament. Dad still thinks that the original name is better.”
 “However, on second thought, our sect is now worthy of being an immortal Holy Land. There are also so many immortals here. Your strength is beyond imagination, and even the Heavenly Dao Rankings can’t accurately describe it.”
 “Therefore, why don’t we change our name to:?That’s an Unimaginably Powerful and Indescribable Immortal Holy Land!?How about that? Isn’t this name grand? It also suits your temperament!
 “Also, there’s a benefit to this name. If you get on any rankings again, it might have the effect of confusing and hiding information.”
 “Dad, are you sure this name isn’t drawing hate for me? Also, can’t we come up with a more cultured name? Don’t be so straightforward. It’ll make it seem like we’re not cultured enough. People will know the content as soon as they see the name, and they won’t have the desire to continue reading!” Li Yu felt a headache coming on. He knew that nothing good would come out of hearing his father say he wanted to change his name.
 “Sigh, as the sect master, I don’t even have the right to name my sect. What a failure. I’m not fit to be the sect master…” Li Qingyun sighed at the sky.
 “Dad, I think the original name is not bad. That’s Quite a Large Sect. It’s original, not tacky, straightforward, and easy to remember!”
 “Alright, that’s what you said. Then our sect will be renamed as: That’s Quite a Large Sect!” Li Qingyun, who had his wish fulfilled, revealed a smug smile.
  “Alright, as long as you’re happy!” Li Yu could not be bothered to struggle. He knew that Li Qingyun had always been brooding over the fact that he had modified the sect’s name without permission.
 After going around in circles, he forced himself to choose his original name.
 However, Li Yu did not care much about names.
 Back then, he changed his name to adapt to this world’s literary style.
 At that time, the sect was not famous, so they could only choose to follow the trend and name it.
 It was also convenient to attract talents and recruit disciples.
 Now that his name was known throughout the world, it could be said that their sect had already led this era and opened up a new era.
 The name of the sect was no longer important.
    
Chapter 219: Waking Up To Women (3)  Even if it was called Solomon Sect, Shutter Sect, Security Sect, Seduction Sect, or Sexy Sect, it did not matter!
 There was still a large group of people kowtowing. Countless people flocked to the morning sun, wanting to enter the Qingyun Sect. Some even felt that it was awesome and clapped their hands in wonder.
 “Dad, what’s the second thing?”
 “The second thing is that I’m preparing to pass the position of sect master to you. Dad has already been surpassed by this group of disciples, so he must make the best use of his time to enter seclusion. Moreover, you young people have also grown up. It’s time to step onto the stage of history and share some of Dad’s responsibilities!” Li Qingyun said.
 “This, this is a little sudden! I…”
 “It’s time for me to pursue my own happiness!” Li Qingyun said with a smile.
 “Alright!” Li Yu knew that his father had found his true love again and was about to begin his second life. He had to fully support him.
  After discussing the future of the sect, Li Yu and Li Qingyun placed the Dao Seeking Tower on the mountain beside them. It would be the training ground for the sect’s disciples in the future.
 Li Yu arrived at the foot of the mountain and rewarded the purple lightning flood dragon with the blood essence and a few Dragon Origin Fruits.
 The purple lightning flood dragon was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes. He never dreamed that he would have the chance to transform into a True Dragon one day, nor did he expect to obtain a trace of the Responding Dragon’s bloodline.
 As Li Yu busied himself, Tang Chi became the center of attention.
     

 Like stars surrounding the moon, he was surrounded by the disciples and began to tell them about what had happened not long ago and the fortuitous encounter in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 It satisfied everyone’s curiosity.
 “As expected of our Eldest Senior Brother, he’s too awesome!”
 
 “What happened to the Flower Realm after that?” Everyone asked curiously.
 The main character of the story, Li Yu, returned to his courtyard.
 Shan Ruoshui was still busy in the spirit herb garden.
 A group of cats was surrounding the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree in the courtyard, basking in the sun like corpses. Their faces were filled with satisfaction and enjoyment, as if the calamity not long ago had never happened.
 Li Yu pushed open the door and walked into the room. Immediately, a fragrance assaulted his nose, and the scene in front of him stunned him. He looked at the room that looked like a woman’s boudoir and thought he had entered the wrong room.
 “When the tiger isn’t home, the monkey makes itself the king. Shan Ruoshui, if I don’t come back soon, this courtyard probably won’t belong to me anymore!”
 Li Yu smiled helplessly and walked into the room. He could not be bothered to clean up the pink decorations.
 In any case, the room smelled good. The bed was soft and comfortable to lie on.
 After resting in the room for a moment, Li Yu got busy again and began distributing the countless immortal swords he had obtained from the Sword Sect to the disciples.
 After hearing the news, the entire sect was in an uproar.
     

 The disciples thought they had misheard, but when they saw the immortal sword, they were so excited that they were about to cry.
 Most of them had never even touched a spirit sword, let alone an immortal sword.
 It was as if a little boy who had never even touched a girl’s hand had suddenly stuffed a goddess-level stunner into his arms. His excitement was probably enough to make him faint.
 By the time all the immortal swords were distributed, night had already fallen.
 Li Yu called Wu Chang, his father, Tang Chi, Ye Qiu, and Gu Yuqi to the courtyard for a barbecue and a few drinks.
 After everyone left late at night, Li Yu returned to his ‘boudoir’ and fell asleep.
 At night, a few cats slipped into his room and jumped onto his bed, snuggling beside him and snoring lazily.
 Li Yu did not mind. He was used to these cats often coming to sleep on his bed.
 Furthermore, it was comfortable to have these furry little fellows warm his bed.
 Perhaps it was the alcohol or the faint fragrance in the air, or perhaps it was the relaxation after finally returning home, but Li Yu slept soundly.
  The next day, the sun rose. Li Yu turned around slightly.
 This feeling was…
 Li Yu suddenly opened his eyes and sat up. What he saw almost made him vomit three mouthfuls of blood.
 The rather spacious bed was filled with four beautiful women with graceful figures.
 Their skin was smooth and fragile. Their figures were delicate and charming.
 What surprised Li Yu the most was that there were two furry, pointed cat ears on their black, brown, or golden hair.
 “Holy shit, cat girls?”
 …
    
Chapter 220: Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition (1)  “Holy shit, cat girls?”
 When he woke up, he was surrounded by women. Four charming and hot cat girls appeared out of thin air beside him. Li Yu was stunned for a moment, and he even felt that he was dreaming.
 After all, only in his previous life would such rotten scenes appear in his dreams.
 He reached out to touch the curvy body beside him. The touch was realistic.
 Furthermore, her delicate body even flipped over when he touched her.
 It caused a chain reaction. The other three kitten girls either flipped over or stretched their waists.
 One of them even hugged Li Yu’s thigh and curled up, wrapping Li Yu’s leg tightly in her warm embrace.
  Li Yu finally woke up. He knew that he was not dreaming. Be it the visual impact or the tactile impact, these four cat girls were real.
 Furthermore, after some thought, he understood that these four cat girls might be the female cats he had adopted in the past.
 Damn, how could this be happening?!
 These four had really gained human forms. Looking at their seductive figures, not only had they become humans, but they were also adults!
 Li Yu suddenly understood what was going on with his room. It was not done by Shan Ruoshui.
 It was these cat girls.
 While he was away, this house had probably become their boudoir.
 
     

 He was already flustered when he woke up early in the morning. Now, there were four charming, beautiful, and evil beauties lying beside him.
 Li Yu’s essence energy surged, and his Yang energy was too strong. He was about to have a nosebleed.
 “Wake up, wake up. Hey, the four of you, wake up!” Li Yu nudged the four girls to wake them up.
 “What’s wrong?”
 “Hey, I haven’t slept enough!” The four catgirls stretched lazily and yawned.
 Their soft waists, long limbs, and plump bodies swayed in front of Li Yu. They were gorgeous and charming.
 He suddenly felt dazzled.
 People could not help but sigh that it was better to have fun together than alone!
 However, after one of the catgirls stretched and looked at Li Yu in a daze, she turned around and crawled to the end of the bed to continue sleeping.
 “How did the few of you gain human forms?” Li Yu asked. He was baffled by his own words.
 “Ah? Oh, yes!” the brown-haired girl replied. She held her cheek with her hand, and her eyes were not fully open.
 The other two looked at Li Yu in a daze, not knowing what had happened.
  “Can I continue sleeping now?” the black-haired girl asked.
 “Sleep? You guys, you guys can’t sleep in my room anymore!”
 “Why?” The brown-haired cat girl scratched her head and looked at Li Yu in confusion.
 “Don’t you know that men and women shouldn’t touch each other?”
 “Who’s the one touching?”
 “I don’t understand!” The cat girls were puzzled, not knowing what Li Yu was talking about. They had slept with Li Yu like this in the past.
     

 What was wrong with Li Yu today?
 “In short, from now on, without my permission, you are not allowed to enter my room at will, much less get on my bed!”
 “Okay!” The four cat girls replied obediently. Then, they changed their positions and continued to sleep.
 Li Yu looked at their beautiful faces and figures and immediately stood up…
 He grabbed each of them and threw them out of the room.
 …
 Two days later, Li Qingyun officially announced that the Qingyun Sect would be renamed “That’s Quite a Large Sect.” At the same time, he announced that he was about to abdicate.
 The sect master would be Li Yu. At the same time, Ji Qinglan, Ye Qiu, Gu Yuqi, Tang Chi, Wu Chang, and the others would be conferred the title of hall masters of the Law Enforcement Hall, the Pill Hall, and the Refining Hall to assist Li Yu in managing the sect.
 The divine beast Qilin, the purple lightning flood dragon, Long Yue, and Xin Ba would be the guardian divine beasts guarding the mountain. They would guard the north, south, east, and west sides of the sect and be managed by General Guo Qilin.
 Mandarin, Sa Hua, and the other cat girls were handed over to Shan Ruoshui to manage. She was in charge of the spirit herb garden, the spirit spring, and the other spirit beasts in the sect.
 At the same time, they would be in charge of Li Yu’s daily needs.
 “Greetings, Sect Master!” All the disciples and junior brothers bowed in unison.
 Li Yu’s voice shook the nine heavens, and his aura was vast, causing him to be unable to help but feel overwhelmed with emotions. Power and status were forever a man’s desire.
 Li Qingyun officially began his seclusion cultivation, while Elder Nie, who had previously entered seclusion to fuse with his body, officially came out of seclusion.
  Now that he had regained his physical body, it was extraordinary. Although he did not have a soul, his body seemed to be able to cultivate on its own.
 Therefore, after Elder Nie fused with the body, he actually possessed the cultivation of a Perfected Immortal. In his previous life, he was only at the Golden Immortal realm.
 Furthermore, this body was extremely powerful and possessed many powerful innate divine powers. Its potential was not something his previous life could compare to.
 It could be said that if he had such a powerful body in his previous life, not only would he not die, but he would probably have already reached the Sovereign Realm by now.
 “This is great, Elder Nie. You finally have a physical body!” The happiest person to obtain a physical body was naturally Ji Qinglan.
 “Haha, Qinglan, it’s your turn to teach me in the future!” Elder Nie said with a smile.
 Fate was miraculous. Elder Nie did not expect that the Ji Qinglan he taught was also the reincarnation of a sword immortal.
 Furthermore, Li Canglan’s attainments in the Sword Dao in the previous life were far above his.
    
Chapter 221: Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition (2)  “Elder Nie, you must be joking!” Ji Qinglan smiled. “In the future, we can comprehend the Sword Dao together!”
 “Oh yes, it’s time to return the sword to you!” Ji Qinglan smiled as he took out Elder Nie’s immortal sword and returned it to him.
 Although this sword was only an immortal artifact, it was Elder Nie’s intrinsic magic treasure in his previous life. It was also the sword that had accompanied him all the way up.
 “Alright, I’ll take it back then!” Elder Nie did not refuse. He knew that Ji Qinglan did not lack divine weapons.
 “Let’s go pay our respects to the sect master!” Elder Nie added.
 “The sect master has just been invited to the Primordial Dao Holy Land of the Great Zenith Domain to participate in the orthodox sect assembly! I think they’re discussing the handling of the demon attack this time and the future development of the human orthodox sects!” Ji Qinglan said.
 “In that case, I’ll pay him a visit after the sect master returns!” Elder Nie said.
  He was extremely grateful to Li Yu. If not for him, he would not have obtained such an extraordinary body this time.
 The calamity caused by Qing Ye was gradually subsiding. However, the demons who participated in the calamity were not only dealt a destructive blow.
 Now, they had no choice but to face the anger and condemnation of the humans.
 Long Tiancang did not expect that his backyard would already be on fire after he barely escaped from the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm.
 Almost all the combat power of the dragon race had fallen, leaving only the old, weak, and disabled.
     

 What was even more despairing was that they had offended the humans. Faced with the anger of the humans, the Azure Dragon Race could only choose to compromise and take a step back. They took out almost all of the wealth of the Azure Dragon Race and compensated the various Holy Lands and sects of the human race.
 Furthermore, they signed an almost humiliating contract that forbade the Azure Dragon Race from leaving the Thousand Dragon Island forever. Otherwise, they would be killed without exception.
 
 The Nine-Headed Lion Race was forever imprisoned in the Death Eagle Mountain Range of the Grand Desolate Forest.
 These two races were forgiven because Long Yue and Xin Ba were Li Yu’s mounts.
 for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 For example, the Golden Feather Clan, the Demon Fox Clan, the Nine-Headed Snake Clan, the Holy Ape Clan, the Demon Ox Clan, and other clansmen who had entered the Sons of Heaven Rankings. For example, the Demon Fox Clan’s Gu Yue, the Golden Feather Clan’s Qian Yu, the Snake-Legged Bai Su, the Holy Ape Clan’s Benbo’erba, and others were all planted with slave seals and became Li Yu’s slaves.
 The other elites would become slaves of the various Holy Lands, and their clansmen would be exiled to the extreme west as sinners, never to return.
 That was a barren land. Banishing them there was equivalent to leaving them to fend for themselves.
 The fiend sects trembled in their hearts when they saw the demons being dealt with.
 They were not afraid of the various Holy Lands, but they were afraid of Li Yu.
 It could be said that without Li Yu, the various Holy Lands would have suffered heavy losses. It was time for the fiend sects to reap the benefits.
  However, it was different with Li Yu around. He could easily destroy the entire world with his strength.
 Furthermore, he was clearly on the side of the orthodox sects, even though their fiend sects did not participate in this calamity.
 However, it was still a threat from the orthodox sects. Li Yu might directly eliminate them to prevent future trouble.
 Therefore, when the Night God Palace, the Netherworld Cult, the Paradise Cult, and the other fiend sects saw Li Yu visit, they were so frightened that their bodies turned cold.
 Fortunately, he was not here to destroy the sect.
     

 Li Yu knew that this world needed checks and balances. If he killed all the wolves, the sheep would eat all the grass, so he would not eliminate all the fiend sects.
 He only needed to maximize his benefits.
 Therefore, when Li Yu left the fiend sects, he took away many treasures. Although he did not lack them now, no one would complain that their treasures were a hot potato.
 Of course, his main goal was to take back the authority to enter the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm from the fiend sects and the many territories and resources they currently possessed.
 This was also why Li Yu chose to participate in the conference held by the various Holy Lands to discuss the future development of the human orthodox sects.
 This was a reshuffling of the powers in the Immortal Martial World.
 Originally, the various Holy Lands, sects, empires, families, demons, fiend sects, and other factions controlled the distribution of resources in this world.
 For example, the Holy Land. Every Holy Land might control many ancient cities and dynasties. They had to offer various treasures to the Holy Land every year.
 At the same time, they possessed many spirit stone mines, precious jade mines, and various opportunities.
 It was the same for the various demon races and fiend sects. Therefore, after the demons were eliminated, many territories and resource lands under their control would naturally be emptied. This involved the issue of distribution.
 As the absolute hero this time, Li Yu naturally would not contribute selflessly. Their sect still had to develop and dominate this world.
  He naturally had the upper hand in the allocation of resources, not to mention that he had the most say now.
 That was why he came to participate in the convention. Of course, he had obtained everything he wanted.
 Most of the resource lands controlled by the demons belonged to the Qingyun Sect. At the same time, the various Holy Lands had also handed over some of their ancient cities to the Qingyun Sect in exchange for some resource lands belonging to the Grand Desolate Forest and the Endless Sea.
 Now, Li Yu had robbed the fiend sects again.
 The current Qingyun Sect was definitely the strongest and wealthiest faction in the Immortal Martial World.
 Furthermore, at Li Yu’s request, the Lingtian Mystic Realm and the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm would be sealed forever. No one was allowed to enter.
 This was because Li Yu wanted to completely fuse and control the world source of the Lingtian Immortal Realm.
 Once he fully controlled that place, he might be able to turn it into his private world. All the opportunities and wealth hidden there would belong to him alone.
    
Chapter 222: Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition (3)  Of course, Li Yu had his own plans.
 If he could completely eliminate the hidden danger in the Lingtian Immortal Realm, that place might become the new home of everyone in the Immortal Martial World one day.
 As the saying went, when one person attained the Dao, his chickens and dogs would ascend to the heavens. Li Yu felt that one day, he might be able to bring the entire world to become an immortal.
 As the reshuffling of the top factions in the Immortal Martial World ended, the entire world temporarily returned to calm.
 On this day, a rainbow light fell from somewhere and silently sank into the depths of the Endless Sea.
 …
 Days passed, and the Genius Excellence Rankings began announcing the top few.
  Yao Xi, Chu Yunhe, and the other renowned geniuses were also on the rankings, allowing the world to witness their elegant demeanor.
 However, everyone was looking forward to seeing Li Yu the most.
 Most people and living beings in the world had never seen his true appearance.
     

 In the imperial palace of the Heavenly Fate Dynasty, Guo Shengxiu looked at the two cultivators who had just left with a melancholic expression and shook his head helplessly.
 Previously, he had searched for a few days in the Heavenly Fate Dynasty but could not find Lu Li. Helpless, he used his identity as an immortal to subdue the current emperor of the Heavenly Fate Dynasty. He wanted to use the power of the Heavenly Fate Dynasty to help find Lu Li.
 However, a few days had passed, and there was still no news of Lu Li. No one had even seen her.
 “Junior Sister, where are you?” Guo Shengxiu sighed miserably.
 
 Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the hall, and the power of heaven and earth began to fluctuate. Guo Shengxiu was already familiar with this situation over the past few days.
 The Genius Excellence Rankings should be announcing a new person on the rankings. Today was the first announcement of that person’s ascension.
 Guo Shengxiu did not have to think to know that the first place would definitely be Li Yu. This was also publicly acknowledged.
 During this period, Guo Shengxiu had already figured out Li Yu’s true identity. What shocked him was that Li Yu was not what he had guessed.
 He was born and raised in this world.
 However, in Guo Shengxiu’s opinion, even if Li Yu was not from the Immortal Realm, he should be the reincarnation of a mighty figure. In short, he was an extraordinary person that she could not offend.
 In the sky, the first place on the Genius Excellence Rankings was indeed Li Yu.
 As Li Yu entered the rankings, auspicious phenomena appeared in the world again. Auspicious clouds filled the sky, and multicolored lights shone.
     

 No one was surprised by this scene. After all, such an auspicious scene had appeared when Li Yu was on the Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 “I can finally see Li Yu’s true face!”
 “I’m looking forward to his Elegance Exhibition!”
 Countless women who had never seen Li Yu’s true appearance looked at the Genius Excellence Rankings in the sky with anticipation.
 Li Yu’s appearance on the rankings made the Qingyun Sect boil with excitement.
 “Our sect master is finally on the rankings!”
 “Sect Master is indeed extraordinary. Such a phenomenon occurs every time you enter the rankings!”
 “Why haven’t I seen the sect master recently?”
 “I heard from my senior brother that the sect master is in seclusion!”
  “He’s in seclusion. Sect Master is already so strong, yet he’s still working so hard. What right do we have to not work hard?”
 “Yeah, the sect master is indeed our role model. We have to learn from him too!”
 As the disciples discussed, Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition began to appear in the sky.
 The first scene was when Li Yu spoke the mantras of the Great Dao.
 The second scene was of Li Yu destroying the spatial passageway opened by the devil with a single strike in the Immortal Court, killing many devils and saving the Holy Lords.
 The third was Li Yu’s sword sweeping through the gray fog that filled the sky, shattering the world, and reconstructing the void.
 The fourth scene was a confrontation between Li Yu and Qing Ye. The latter agreed to end the spell…
 Everyone in the world fell silent when they saw this shocking scene.
    
Chapter 223: Our Great Hero Is Tired  Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition shocked the entire world again. Although everyone had previously witnessed how powerful Li Yu was through the other people on the rankings.
 However, the impact of these scenes was still huge.
 Especially after Li Yu destroyed the spatial passageway invaded by the devil with a single strike, he even killed the invading devil.
 That strike did not have any gorgeous special effects, not even a sword glow.
 However, it gave everyone a visual impact that struck the soul.
 After that, he swung his sword and instantly wiped out the strange gray fog that seemed to have surged out of the Gate of Hell. It shattered the heavens and the earth, and the sun and moon changed color. The scene was like a miracle, as if Pangu had split the heavens and the earth apart, shocking the soul.
 However, after the shock, everyone sighed in their hearts and could not calm down for a long time.
  “It’s indeed Li Yu who saved us. If he hadn’t rushed back in time, the Immortal Martial World would probably have been destroyed by that person called Qing Ye!”
 “Yeah, just from these few scenes, Li Yu has saved the world more than once!”
 “I’ve imagined Li Yu’s appearance countless times, but no fantasy seems to be as good as his true appearance and bearing. He’s too extraordinary!”
 “I knew it. This first place is well deserved. I’m afraid many people can’t achieve the legends created by these scenes in their entire lives!”
 Countless people discussed excitedly, and countless were grateful. There were also countless women who kept Li Yu in their hearts and became a figure that could never be forgotten.
 “This Li Yu is too freakish!” The corners of Guo Shengxiu’s mouth twitched as she looked at the scene in the sky.
 Previously, he had only seen Li Yu kill Qing Ye. Although it was enough to prove that Li Yu was powerful, it was still understandable.
 
 However, the power of each sword strike just now had already exceeded his understanding.
 Even in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, there were probably not many people with Li Yu’s strength.
 They were the patriarchs and elders of their immortal sects.
 If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would never have thought that such an expert could appear in a lower realm with thin spiritual energy and weak Dao fate.
     

 He had to keep a low profile. The Jingxing Realm was not simple. There were simply crouching tigers and hidden dragons.
 In the Qingyun Sect, the disciples were also excited. Even Ye Qiu and Gu Yuqi could not help but exclaim, “Our sect master is too handsome!”
 “Yeah, we didn’t see these scenes back then. No wonder the various Holy Lords said that they owed their sect master several lives! It seems like it’s true!”
 “Who in the entire Immortal Martial World doesn’t owe our senior brother his life!”
 “Senior Brother probably doesn’t know that he’s on the rankings!”
 “Yeah, he’s in seclusion. Sigh, Senior Brother is so powerful, but he’s still so hardworking. We’re really ashamed of our inferiority!”
 “That’s right. To cultivate an ordinary human body to a physique comparable to a god, Senior Brother must have paid an unimaginable price in private…”
 “Phew… how comfortable!” Li Yu’s ecstatic voice suddenly sounded from the Heavenly Dao Rankings. At the same time, the Elegance Exhibition began its live broadcast.
 On the screen, the half-naked Li Yu was soaking in the hot spring, his face filled with satisfaction and enjoyment.
 This scene instantly drenched countless girls.
 Li Yu could not help but look stunning. His figure was impeccable. The more meat on his body, the better. His body proportions and muscle lines were perfect as if they were carved by nature.
 “Is Eldest Senior Brother in seclusion?” The corners of Ye Qiu’s mouth twitched. Why did he feel that it was different from what he had imagined?
 “Perhaps I was too tired after cultivating just now, so I decided to relax in the hot spring!” Gu Yuqi explained.
 “Master, have some grapes!” With a gentle voice, a graceful figure appeared by the pool beside Li Yu. She held a plate of grapes, took one, and placed it in Li Yu’s mouth.
 “Master, let me massage your shoulders for you!” Another figure appeared behind Li Yu. She had a slim figure and devastatingly beautiful appearance, like a fairy.
 She gently lifted her sleeves, revealing her slender hands and crystalline arms, and was about to massage Li Yu’s shoulders.
 “No need. You guys may leave. Let me be alone for a while!” Li Yu waved his hand.
 “Yes, Master!” The fairies replied in unison and left.
 Li Yu heaved a sigh of relief. “Sigh, it’s finally quiet!”
 Every time he came to the hot spring, these fairies would be especially enthusiastic and solicitous, rubbing his shoulders and feeding him grapes.
 Most importantly, they did not rub their shoulders or backs properly. All of them were dishonest, making it impossible for them to soak in the hot spring properly.
 How annoying!
 Li Yu leaned against the side of the hot spring pool and closed his eyes to rest, enjoying the comfort of the hot spring bath.
     

 Ever since he became the sect master, he was bothered by everything every day. It was difficult for him to slack off for a while.
 Fortunately, most of the matters had been settled recently, and his junior brothers could do their own things. Therefore, he used the excuse of entering seclusion and hiding on the Misty Immortal Island to relax.
 Leaning against the side of the hot spring, Li Yu fell asleep unknowingly.
 However, Li Yu would never have imagined that there were millions of living beings watching him soak in the hot spring until he fell asleep.
 If Li Yu knew that his shower had been broadcasted live by the Heavenly Dao Rankings, he would probably attack with his sword!
 “Go to sleep. You should rest well too!”
 Seeing Li Yu fall asleep in the hot spring, many people were suddenly touched and heartbroken.
 No one thought that he was greedy for pleasure. Instead, they thought that he was too tired from worrying about the commoners.
 Moreover, the current Li Yu seemed to have shed the halo of a god and returned to his true self.
 They suddenly realized that this hero who had saved the world was as powerful as a god.
 Yet, he was not born powerful, like the sun, moon, and stars.
 Instead, he was someone like them who would be tired and needed rest.
 Perhaps they would be afraid, nervous, afraid, and uncertain.
 They thought of how Li Yu had faced the terrifying demonic invasion alone and the gray fog that seemed to come from the netherworld.
 He shouldered the hopes and expectations of everyone, the lives of countless living beings in the world.
 Facing desperate situations alone again and again, he felt immense pressure.
 How much hardship and pain had been hidden behind that seemingly easy strike to hone such an extraordinary strike?
 That body that seemed as powerful as a god had experienced countless hardships. It had only been trained to produce the power to support the entire sky and the commoners of the world.
  And today, their great hero was tired and needed to rest.
 If not for the Heavenly Dao Rankings, they might only see his power but not his pressure. They could only see his extraordinariness but not his exhaustion.
 for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 If not for the Heavenly Dao Rankings, who would know the true appearance of such an expert?
 This reality moved them!
 Just like that, countless people and living beings silently watched the scene of Li Yu soaking in the hot spring in the sky. Their expressions were solemn as they held their breaths and focused.
 Some even had tears in their eyes, while others had sore noses.
 Some cried silently.
 However, no one spoke or made a sound, as if they were afraid that they would disturb Li Yu’s rest.
    
Chapter 224: True Immortal Fart  “So that person is Li Yu!”
 In a certain valley manor, a man with a lazy expression, casual clothes, and loose hair looked at the scene in the sky with a frown.
 If Li Yu was here, he would recognize this person as the person he had seen after encountering the transparent spatial barrier in the Lingtian Mystic Realm that day.
 “I didn’t expect there to be such a terrifying person in the Jingxing Realm. Wu Yong, we have to leave the Jingxing Realm!” A hoarse voice sounded in the man’s ear.
 Wu Yong nodded, his eyes filled with shock.
 When he saw Li Yu shatter the space in front of him that day, he thought it was just a coincidence.
 After all, the space in the Lingtian Mystic Realm that day was extremely strange.
  However, he did not expect Li Yu to really have the ability to shatter space.
 This guy was simply sick.
 “Where are we going?” Wu Yong asked.
 “Let’s go to the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm first! The information about the Flower Realm can help us exchange for something important!” the hoarse voice said.
 “The Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm? I don’t know how to get there!” Wu Yong replied.
 “Don’t worry, I have my ways! Those who have asked you to keep a low profile recently. Don’t cause trouble and don’t attract Li Yu’s attention!” the hoarse voice added.
 Wu Yong nodded. He was also afraid. Fortunately, they kept a low profile at this stage. Otherwise, he would probably have died under Li Yu’s sword.
 
 Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition lasted twice as long as the others, but Li Yu slept the entire time.
 After the Elegance Exhibition ended, the rankings released the rewards. As expected, Li Yu’s reward was still kept a secret, and he had obtained another additional reward.
 This time, no one was surprised. Li Yu’s extraordinariness was worthy of the additional reward from the Heavenly Dao.
 At that moment, Li Yu suddenly woke up on the Misty Immortal Island.
 “Heavenly Dao reward? Damn, I just got on the Excellence Rankings!”
 Li Yu instantly perked up. Thinking of the live broadcast of the Excellence Rankings, Li Yu felt uneasy.
     

 Wouldn’t the entire process of him soaking in the hot spring be broadcasted to the world by the Heavenly Dao Rankings?
 This ranking was indeed dangerous. Fortunately, he did not indulge himself in lust just now. Otherwise, he would have definitely died of embarrassment.
 However, Li Yu felt that the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings were really fragrant.
 Great Dao auspicious clouds and immortal essence purple clouds.
 This was a treasure similar to the Immortal Spring and the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree. It was a reward that could benefit everyone in the sect and allow the Qingyun Sect to further become an immortal blessed land.
 According to the information sent into his mind by the Heavenly Dao, the Great Dao auspicious cloud was condensed from the power of the Great Dao. The Dao fate it contained was several times stronger than the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree.
 As for the immortal essence purple qi, it was even more powerful. It was the source of immortal energy, the purest and purest immortal energy.
 The immortal energy contained in the top immortal crystals in the world could not compare.
 The lower realm contained spiritual energy, while the Immortal Realm contained immortal energy.
 The reason why people from the Immortal Realm were born with Immortal Spirit Realm cultivation was not only because of the special laws of heaven and earth contained in the Immortal Realm, but also because of the immortal energy.
 Therefore, with the Immortal Essence Purple Qi and the Great Dao Auspicious Cloud, along with the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree and the Immortal Spring, the Qingyun Sect became a true immortal treasure land.
 There were probably not many Holy Lands in the Immortal Realm that could compare to this place.
 “It’s not a dream to become immortals together!” Li Yu said with a smile.
 However, the only flaw in this reward was that… it was sent into his body again.
 Now, immortal energy was churning in his stomach, and auspicious clouds were surging in his respiratory tract. He had to vent it out!
  Li Yu quickly put on his clothes and left the Misty Immortal Island to return to his residence.
 He first looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings. His Elegance Exhibition was over. Then, he checked the house and courtyard.
 After confirming that no one was around, he relaxed slightly. The immortal energy in his stomach surged, and then…
 Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!
 Rich immortal essence purple gas gushed out and instantly spread in all directions.
 Although there was no one around, Li Yu’s series of earth-shattering farts shocked the birds resting on the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree and the colorful butterflies in the courtyard.
 The butterflies and birds, who had already developed intelligence under the nourishment of the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree and the Immortal Spring, immediately sensed how extraordinary Li Yu’s fart was.
 They immediately flew towards Li Yu and danced around him while chattering non-stop.
 Bathed in this pure and rich immortal energy, the birds and butterflies rapidly transformed.
     

 Rich immortal essence purple qi began to spread from Li Yu’s courtyard to the entire sect.
 “This is… purple qi from the east!” Feng Xian was the first to sense the immortal essence purple qi and was immediately shocked.
 Li Yu’s courtyard was located in the southeast corner of the sect. The immortal essence purple qi emitted a faint purple halo that spread from the southeast. It looked like the auspicious scene of the purple qi coming from the east.
 “This immortal energy is so rich and pure!” Sensing the pure immortal energy contained in the purple gas, Feng Xian was even more surprised and could not help but take a deep breath.
 It was truly refreshing. A mouthful of immortal energy allowed his cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds.
 Furthermore, his body was rapidly transforming as he bathed in the immortal energy.
 Perhaps ordinary people did not know how extraordinary this purple gas was, but Feng Xian naturally knew.
 One mouthful of this immortal energy was priceless!
 Suck, suck, suck…
 Perhaps he was afraid that the immortal energy would disappear in a moment, Feng Xian immediately started breathing madly. Furthermore, he only breathed and did not breathe. He looked like he was about to suffocate and die immediately!
 A disciple passing by nearby rushed over in fright. “Hall Master, Hall Master, what’s wrong!”
 Thud!
 Feng Xian kicked the disciple away. He did not have the time to answer the disciple and continued sucking madly.
 At the same time, Elder Nie and Ji Qinglan sensed the dense immortal energy and were pleasantly surprised.
 “Looks like Sect Master has obtained the Heavenly Dao’s reward again!” Ji Qinglan immediately guessed what was going on.
 It was the same when Li Yu obtained the Immortal Spring and the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree.
 It seemed that the reward from the Heavenly Dao was this dense immortal energy.
 “This is incredible. This is simply like sending over an Immortal Crystal Mountain. No, this immortal energy is even purer than immortal crystals! Looks like even if I don’t cultivate in the future, my cultivation will improve rapidly!” Ji Qinglan was extremely excited.
 As someone from the Immortal Realm, he was the same as Feng Xian and naturally knew how extraordinary this immortal energy was.
 “Hmm? Where did this immortal energy come from? It’s so pure!” Lu Li, who was hiding in the corner and eating fruits, widened her sparkling eyes. She took a deep breath and revealed a pleasantly surprised expression.
  Immediately, he stopped eating the fruits and breathed in the rich immortal energy.
 Immortal essence purple qi quickly filled the entire sect. Countless disciples bathed in the immortal qi and sensed the transformation in their bodies. Their cultivation levels soared, and their faces revealed pleasant surprise.
 The Qingyun Sect’s Protective Mountain Array had long been set up by Feng Xian. It could better protect the Immortal Qi and Dao fate inside. At the same time, it could automatically absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and gather it in the array formation.
 Just as countless disciples of the Qingyun Sect were enjoying the extraordinary experience brought by the immortal energy…
 Li Yu’s figure suddenly appeared in the air, and then he looked up and sneezed.
 “Ah… choo!”
 The sneeze shook the nine heavens, spitting out a fog that blotted out the sky.
 Then, under the shocked gazes of Feng Xian, Ji Qinglan, Elder Nie, Lu Li, Gu Yuqi, and all the Qingyun Sect disciples, it transformed into a seven-colored auspicious cloud that hung in the sky.
    
Chapter 225: Upgrading the Heavenly Dao Rankings, Sons of Destiny Appear (1)  The fog produced by Li Yu’s sneeze transformed into auspicious clouds in the sky above the Qingyun Sect.
 Seven-colored light lingered on it, and rich Dao fate energy spread out. If one observed carefully, they could see an extraordinary Dao rune phenomenon in the clouds.
 Furthermore, the scenery that different people saw was different and extremely profound.
 Cough, cough, cough…
 Feng Xian, who had sucked in too much immortal energy, almost died on the spot.
 However, not only did the surrounding immortal energy not disappear, but it even became denser. Feng Xian knew that he did not have to be anxious.
 The immortal energy would probably not disappear.
  When he saw the auspicious clouds that filled the sky from Li Yu’s sneeze, he was shocked.
 “Could this be the legendary Great Dao auspicious cloud!” The knowledgeable Feng Xian had seen descriptions and records of such auspicious clouds before.
 This was a Great Dao auspicious cloud that could only appear in some extraordinary grotto-heavens in the Immortal Realm.
 It was an extraordinary blessing to the people of the Immortal Realm.
 To be able to cultivate under such auspicious clouds, one’s cultivation realm would improve by leaps and bounds.
 In fact, many of the bottlenecks he might encounter on the cultivation path would disappear.
 Furthermore, this auspicious cloud had effects similar to the Dao Comprehension Stone and the Dao Comprehension Tea. One could comprehend the Great Dao by observing the Dao runes inside, and it was helpful in improving one’s Dao techniques.
 
     

 It could be said that the path of cultivation was like groping forward in the endless darkness. This Great Dao auspicious cloud was like a lamp in the night that illuminated the future.
 The Great Dao auspicious cloud combined with the dense immortal essence purple qi was a treasure land that everyone in the Immortal Realm could only dream of.
 Lu Li had the same idea as Feng Xian.
 Her time in the Qingyun Sect had broadened her horizons.
 The sect distributed an immortal sword to every disciple, and they could obtain immortal spring water to drink every day.
 Even some immortal sects in the Immortal Realm could not do this.
 Now, there was also such an extraordinary immortal essence purple qi and the auspicious cloud of the Great Dao.
 Lu Li suddenly felt that the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect was not appealing anymore. Compared to the Qingyun Sect, it was simply a remote village.
 To be precise, most sects in the Immortal Realm might not be able to compare with the Qingyun Sect.
 Cultivating here was much more fragrant than in the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect.
 When Lu Li saw the Great Dao auspicious cloud, memories of this auspicious cloud instantly surfaced in the depths of her mind. They came from her bloodline.
 As these memories surfaced, more memories surfaced. She immediately knew that the dense immortal energy was the top-notch immortal energy—Immortal Essence Violet Qi.
 Not only that, but Lu Li also realized that her bloodline power seemed to have awakened further. Her cultivation was rising rapidly, and a mysterious power surged from the depths of her soul.
 “Heavens, Sect Master is indeed extraordinary. A sneeze can actually produce such a phenomenon!”
 “No wonder that extraordinary purple aura suddenly appeared just now. Looks like it was also caused by the sect master’s sneeze.”
 “He can transform into auspicious clouds and immortal energy with a sneeze. Our sect master is indeed a god!”
 The disciples discussed excitedly, and their admiration for Li Yu was simply like the overflowing Yellow River.
 After releasing the immortal energy and auspicious clouds, Li Yu quickly returned to his courtyard.
     

 However, he was surprised to find a large group of girls in fluttering colorful dresses and some handsome men gathered in the courtyard.
 “This is great! I can finally take human form!”
 “Sister, you look so beautiful in your human form!”
 “Me too. She’s much prettier than me!”
 “We can finally play with Sister Ruoshui and Sister Mandarin!”
 Hearing the excited discussions of the girls, Li Yu immediately understood that the butterflies and birds had become intelligent.
 The immortal essence purple qi and the Great Dao auspicious cloud were indeed extraordinary.
 However, Li Yu knew that this was also thanks to the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree and the Immortal Spring. There were many spirit beasts that had developed intelligence in the Nine-tailed Mountain.
 After some time, there would probably be more demons than disciples.
 Of course, Li Yu did not discriminate against these demons. They could also become immortals.
 “Greetings, Sect Master!” Seeing Li Yu return, the demons bowed in unison.
 “No need for formalities. You guys can report to Shan Ruoshui and Mandarin later!” Li Yu said.
 Currently, all the spirit beasts and demons in the sect were under Shan Rushui’s management, and the orange cat demon, Orange, had already become Shan Ruoshui’s right-hand man.
  Otherwise, Shan Ruoshui would be too busy alone.
 “Yes, Sect Master!” The demons bowed in response, and then they left Li Yu’s courtyard to report to the Spirit Beast Hall.
 Some butterflies and birds that had yet to transform into human forms were still flying beside the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree, while the Chongming Bird was flying around the auspicious cloud.
 At this moment, the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree had grown much taller. Its crown was almost reaching the clouds in the sky, and many strange flowers and herbs that were never there before bloomed in the courtyard.
 Within the range of the Qingyun Sect’s Protective Mountain Array, the mountains, rocks, and plants were undergoing subtle changes.
 In the sky, as the first place on the Genius Excellence Rankings was announced, the names on the rankings disappeared one by one. In the end, the entire Genius Excellence Rankings disappeared.
 After that, the Human Sons of Heaven Rankings, the Demon Sons of Heaven Rankings, the Divine Weapon Rankings, the 3000 Physique Rankings, the Hidden Dragon Rankings, and other rankings disappeared one after another.
 In the end, all the rankings disappeared, and a few words appeared on the golden scroll on the Heavenly Dao Rankings: Myriad Worlds Rankings.
    
Chapter 226: Upgrading the Heavenly Dao Rankings, Sons of Destiny Appear (2)  Countless people were surprised to see the changes in the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 The Myriad Worlds Rankings had clearly been upgraded.
 Those on the rankings in the future were probably not limited to the Immortal Martial World.
 Who knows what ranking is going to be announced next?  Who will be on the rankings?  This made countless people look forward to it.
 They had always lived in the Immortal Martial World. Many had never even left their cities, sects, or countries, much less see the wider world.
  The previous Heavenly Dao Rankings had already broadened their horizons.
 It allowed many to see how extraordinary people and things were in this world.
 This was especially true for the Genius Excellence Rankings.
 They did not expect to witness a wider world and the extraordinary legends of the myriad worlds.
 Just the thought of it excited them.
 It was as if someone who had lived in the mountains for a long time had suddenly come into contact with the Internet.
 A few months passed in the blink of an eye…
 
 Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 The new Phoenix Emperor of the Phoenix Ancient Cave, Huo Wu, had suddenly stepped into the Saint Realm from the late-stage Pseudo-Saint Realm. It instantly shook the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 As for her ranking on the Immortal Realm Sons of Heaven Rankings, it directly surpassed Gongshu Qitian and became number one.
 “This new Phoenix Emperor is indeed not simple. She actually broke through from the late stage of the Pseudo-Saint Realm to the Saint Realm in such a short period of time!”
 “Tsk tsk, with this breakthrough speed, he must have obtained some great fortune!”
 “That’s right. I heard that she went to the Burial Earth World not long ago. She probably obtained some great fortune there!”
 “She went to the Burial Earth World? Tsk tsk, this new emperor is indeed bold. That’s a forbidden area for immortals. Entering it will mean death!”
     

 “Mm, I heard that she’s also preparing for the opening of the Ancient Road to Heaven!”
 “In that case, the Ancient Phoenix Cave should shine this time on the Ancient Road to Heaven!”
 “That’s right. Huo Wu’s strength is not much weaker than Gongshu Qitian to begin with. Now that her cultivation has increased greatly, she might really stand a chance!”
 Phoenix Ancient Cave, Divine Brilliance Palace.
 “Congratulations, Your Majesty!” Countless experts of the ancient cave congratulated the Phoenix Emperor for stepping into the Saint realm.
 After the Phoenix Emperor Huo Wu returned from the Burial Earth World, she went into seclusion. Today, she officially came out of seclusion after successfully breaking through to the Saint realm.
 She also became the youngest saint in the history of the Phoenix Ancient Cave.
 “Huo Wu, you didn’t disappoint me after all. Feng Yi will definitely follow you to the Ancient Road to Heaven!” The previous Phoenix Emperor, Tian Xun, said with extreme relief.
 She was Huo Wu’s mother and the strongest person in the Phoenix Ancient Cave, one of the sixteen Saint Kings of the Immortal Realm.
 The Ancient Phoenix Cave had many Saints and Great Saints.
 However, in the entire Immortal Realm’s younger generation, those who could enter the Saint Realm at such a young age could be counted on one hand.
 Huo Wu’s future limit was not something anyone could compare to.
 In Tian Xun’s opinion, her daughter could even surpass her and touch the Holy Lord and the Sovereign Realm in the future.
 “Thank you, Queen Mother. I will not disappoint you!” Huo Wu was also filled with confidence. She had obtained the bloodline of the Ancestral Magus, Zhurong, in the Burial Earth World and two Paragon Bones.
 The current Huo Wu possessed the Vermilion Bird bloodline, the Zhurong bloodline, the Phoenix Overlord Body, five supreme bones, and the Great Nirvana Divine Fire.
 She was confident that her current strength would absolutely crush all the elites of the Nine Heavens Immortal Realm.
 Suddenly, the power of heaven and earth fluctuated violently. A bell sounded in the sky, accompanied by the slight vibration of space.
 At the same time, a phenomenon appeared. The clouds in the sky changed as thousands of golden clouds surfaced, even covering the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
  There were tens of thousands of multicolored lights in the golden clouds, and various wonders were faintly discernible. It was as if countless gods and saints were stepping on Yin and Yang while plucking the stars.
 Soon, the multicolored light slowly gathered into a giant scroll. Countless obscure and complicated golden characters surfaced. There were a total of 100 characters. In the end, these 100 characters transformed into 100 golden lights that flew in all directions.
 “This is… the appearance of the Sons of Destiny!”
 Countless elders in the Immortal Realm were shocked to see the strange scene in the sky.
 They had either seen such a phenomenon in ancient books or heard of it from their predecessors. It was a phenomenon that had appeared a million years ago.
 Every golden light represented a Great Dao inscription and a Dharma Body Dao Fruit.
 These Great Dao inscriptions would fuse into the body of a certain Son of Heaven, allowing him to directly possess the Dharma Body Dao Fruit and become the embodiment of the Great Dao, becoming the most extraordinary existence in the myriad worlds.
 Therefore, these people were known as the Sons of Destiny.
 It was said that this might be the way the Ancient God Dynasty selected the Divine Lord Holy Sons.
 The chosen person could directly become a Heavenly Destiny Divine Lord in the future and ascend to the Divine Court to control a world with supreme authority.
     

 However, there were also rumors that this was a sign of the impending calamity. Every time the Sons of Destiny appeared, a terrifying calamity would descend. Demons would invade, foreign lands would descend, and natural disasters would occur.
 These hundred Sons of Destiny would bear the heavy responsibility of eliminating demons and uphold justice in the future.
 Others said that the Sons of Destiny were people with limitless merit in his previous life. They had obtained the rewards of the Heavenly Dao and could ascend to the Great Dao in the future, becoming existences above the world.
 Of course, these were all speculations. No one knew why the Sons of Destiny had appeared.
 It was as if no one knew why the Heavenly Dao Rankings appeared.
 However, to many mighty figures, this was an opportunity that descended from the heavens. The so-called Dharma Body Dao Fruit belonged to whoever obtained it.
 “It’s indeed a world of strife!”
 “Looks like the world isn’t peaceful anymore. I wonder how many monstrous experts will rise up. I wonder how many more people will be plunged into misery and suffering!”
 …
 “What kind of phenomenon is this, Queen Mother?” Huo Wu asked curiously.
 “The Sons of Destiny have appeared!” Tian Xun said. “The myriad worlds are bustling again!”
 Huo Wu looked at Tian Xun in surprise. Tian Xun paused and explained to Huo Wu about the Sons of Destiny.
 “Most of these Sons of Destiny will appear in the lower realm. They don’t have young geniuses who have become immortals, but they might become Golden Immortals and Pseudo-Saints in a few short years. Their future will be limitless.”
 “Therefore, the various factions will compete for the Sons of Destiny and take them under their wing. Of course, there must be many people who want to snatch the Great Dao inscriptions from these people or possess their Dao Fruit Dharma Bodies!”
 “Therefore, the various factions and the myriad worlds will definitely start a war around the Sons of Destiny!”
 Hearing her mother’s words, Huo Wu nodded. It seemed that it was going to be an era where experts came in large numbers. There was nothing to be proud of now that she had become a saint.
 However, this was good too. His future path would not be too lonely.
 “Queen Mother, I’ll send someone to the lower realm to search for the chosen ones!” said Huo Wu.
 “Leave this to me. Just focus on preparing for the Ancient Road to Heaven!” Tian Xun said.
 “Alright!” Huo Wu nodded. The urgent matter at hand was naturally the Ancient Road to Heaven. This was the first time their Phoenix Ancient Cave hoped to obtain the inheritance of the Heavenly Imperial Decree.
 In the Qin family, Qin Jingyun looked at the phenomenon in the sky and said, “Wang.”
 “Here!” A figure seemed to appear out of thin air.
 “Immediately send people to the various lower realms to search for any news regarding the Sons of the Destiny!”
  “Yes, my lord!”
 Almost at the same time, the various ancient families, ancient royal families, top factions, and top sects of the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, the Profound Heaven Immortal Realm, and the Luo Heaven Immortal Realm sent a large number of experts to the lower realm to find the Sons of Destiny.
 In the Immortal Martial World, a natural phenomenon also appeared in the sky, shocking the world.
 As the Great Dao inscriptions dissipated, a golden light entered the Qingyun Sect and finally entered Murong Xingqiao’s body.
 In an instant, countless golden words flickered and transformed around Murong Xingqiao. The power of the Great Dao instantly gathered around her. Waves of the Great Dao reverberated in her ears, and the stars moved in front of her eyes. The world changed, everything evolved, and time passed…
 Murong Xingqiao instantly entered a mysterious feeling as if everything around her was gone. She was the heavens, the earth, the endless void…
 At the same time, another golden light fell into the Night God Palace and fused into Night Whisper’s body.
 …
    
Chapter 227: Release the News  for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 Seeing the phenomenon in the sky, Feng Xian and Ji Qinglan recognized that it was a sign of the appearance of the Sons of Destiny.
 In their previous lives, they had also heard about the Sons of Destiny. However, they did not expect to have one by their side in this life.
 They all saw a golden light land in their sect.
 They also sensed the extraordinary fluctuations of the Great Dao. Soon, they learned that the person who obtained the Great Dao inscription was their junior brother, Murong Xingqiao.
 At the moment, Murong Xingqiao was still fusing the Great Dao inscriptions. Some curious disciples gathered outside the house and discussed animatedly.
 Feng Xian and Ji Qinglan immediately dispersed the crowd and instructed them not to tell anyone what they had seen.
 He was well aware that the appearance of the Great Dao inscription was a blessing and a curse. It would definitely attract the covetous eyes of some people.
  They were not afraid. They just did not want to attract unnecessary trouble, nor did they want Murong Xingqiao to be in danger.
 “Senior Brother, go inform the sect master. He should know about this!” Feng Xian said.
 The appearance of the Sons of Destiny was definitely not a small matter. It was enough to shake the worlds and cause many calamities and battles.
 Therefore, he felt the need to inform Li Yu about this.
 “Okay, I’ll go now!” Ji Qinglan nodded. He knew that this was no small matter.
 At the moment, Li Yu was checking the newly upgraded system.
 Not long ago, the system had been upgraded.
 Li Yu checked his personal information in the system first. There was not much change.
 Name: Li Yu (automatically generated)
 Age: 18 (automatically generated)
 Gender: Male (automatically generated)
 Owner’s Sect: That’s Quite A Large Sect (automatically generated)
 Constitution: Human Body (filled in manually)
 Bloodline: Type A (filled in manually)
 Weapon: An ordinary-looking sword (filled in manually)
 Magical Power: Basic Attack Sword Art (filled in manually)
     

 Special Skill: Serious Slash (filled in manually)
 Mount: Guo Qilin (Qilin), Long Yue (Azure Dragon), Xin Ba (Suan Ni), Little Purple (True Dragon) (automatically generated)
 Experience Bar: 0.42% short of becoming invincible…
 However, after leveling up, the method of increasing experience points changed. He could only gain them by completing the system mission.
 Furthermore, ever since the experience bar value fell below one and became a decimal point, the experience points reward of the mission became lesser and lesser.
 It was filled with tricks.
 He had already completed all the sect missions in the previous stage.
 The sect already had more than 1000 Nascent Soul realm disciples, far exceeding the 50 required by the system.
 The number of Soul Formation Stage and Profound Void Martial Stage disciples, as well as the mission of collecting natural oddities, spirit beasts, and divine beasts, were also exceeded.
 Now, the new sect mission had become building an immortal sect.
 There were also many small missions, such as having more than ten thousand disciples.
 The Immortal Spirit Realm required 500 people.
 There were at least ten immortals, five Perfected Immortals, and one Golden Immortal.
 Furthermore, the disciples needed to complete the corresponding contribution missions to reach the required contribution points, such as subduing demons, saving lives, and so on…
 Overall, it was similar to before.
 In fact, even without the system’s request, Li Yu’s disciples had killed plenty of demons and saved lives over the past few months.
 The current Immortal Martial World was much more peaceful and peaceful than before.
 However, there was always white and black in the world. There was good and evil. Ghosts and monsters could never be eliminated.
 Furthermore, as the factions affiliated with their sects controlled more cities and territories, their responsibility increased.
 After all, if they accepted the offerings of the commoners, they would have the responsibility to protect the safety of the commoners.
 Furthermore, the various Holy Lands had suffered heavy losses and would not recover anytime soon. The Qingyun Sect naturally had to shoulder the heavy responsibility.
 ‘Looks like I’ll have to expand the sect further!’ Li Yu thought to himself. Although he had already made major changes to the entire Nine-tailed Mountain Realm, he could not stop thinking about it.
 However, it still seemed unable to satisfy the requirements of the ten thousand disciples.
 Two months ago, after Li Yu completely fused with the world source of the Lingtian Immortal Realm.
 He used the world power of the Lingtian Immortal Realm to remodel the sect’s terrain, making the two peaks of the Qingyun Sect larger, taller, and more majestic.
 It became a true immortal mountain.
 In addition, he had also created many new immortal mountains and precious lands for the expansion of his sect. However, it seemed like he needed to expand further.
     

 However, right at this moment, a new sect mission notification suddenly popped up in the system: Sons of Destiny mission.
 Li Yu took a look. The mission introduced the Sons of Destiny in detail.
 The mission requirement was to “take in 20 Sons of Destiny.”
 “There’s a total of 100, and I’m supposed to take in 20. This mission is a little inhuman. Moreover, the Sons of Destiny are scattered across various worlds. It’ll be difficult for me to find them, let alone absorb them!”
 After reading the system’s mission introduction, Li Yu lost interest.
 Fortunately, there was no punishment for this mission.
 The experience points rewarded were tempting, twice as much as the sect’s director.
 However, Li Yu did not want to make things difficult for himself.
 As soon as he closed the system interface, Feng Xian came to seek an audience and informed Li Yu about the Sons of Destiny and Murong Xingqiao.
 “Murong Xingqiao is one of the chosen ones!” Li Yu was slightly surprised.
 “This matter will definitely alarm the various worlds. I’m afraid the top factions of the various Immortal Realms will begin to search for traces of the Sons of Destiny! Many people from the Immortal Martial World will probably come to visit after some time!” Feng Xian said.
 “Hmm, that’s good news!” A thought-provoking smile surfaced on Li Yu’s lips as he nodded slightly.
 If Ji Qinglan saw it again, he would definitely remember that he had seen this smile when he fought Li Yu.
 Feng Xian looked at Li Yu in surprise, not understanding what he meant, but he did not say anything and only nodded.
 “Alright, you may leave first. Oh yes, release the news of the appearance of the Sons of Destiny in our sect!” Li Yu ordered.
 “Let… let it out? Why?” The surprise on Feng Xian’s face intensified. He could not hide such a thing, so why would he let the news out? Wasn’t this asking for trouble?
 He could not understand Li Yu’s thoughts anymore.
 “Do as I say. I have my own plans. Oh yes, get Murong Xingqiao to see me later! Also, send someone to investigate and see if there are any other clues about the Sons of Destiny in our Immortal Martial World!” Li Yu said.
 “Oh, alright!” Feng Xian’s head was filled with question marks, but he did not say anything else. He bowed and received the order before leaving.
 After walking out of Li Yu’s courtyard, Feng Xian looked back at the courtyard and scratched his head. He still could not understand, but he could only follow the sect master’s orders.
 A day later, Murong Xingqiao completely fused with the Great Dao inscription, and his cultivation directly entered the Immortal Spirit Realm from the Mahayana Realm.
 Previously, Li Yu had given Murong Xingqiao many treasures to help her rapidly improve her cultivation from the Golden Core Realm to the Mahayana Realm.
  “Sect Master, you were looking for me?” Murong Xingqiao arrived at Li Yu’s courtyard and bowed with cupped hands.
 “What happens after you fuse with the Great Dao inscriptions?” Li Yu asked.
 “My cultivation has already entered the late stage of the Immortal Spirit Realm. I should enter the Upper Immortal Realm soon under the effect of the Great Dao inscription!” Murong Xingqiao replied.
 Li Yu smiled and nodded, thinking to himself that opportunities were indeed different. Murong Xingqiao had given him a lot of resources.
 “Come, have a seat!” Li Yu said. Before he finished his sentence, the power of heaven and earth fluctuated again. There was a change in the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 The golden scroll on the rankings flourished with golden light, and two new rankings slowly condensed below the rankings: the Heavenly Physique Rankings and the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings.
 Li Yu and Murong Xingqiao’s eyes flashed when they saw this.
 …
    
Chapter 228: Releasing Heavenly Physique Rankings  “The Heavenly Dao Rankings is announcing a new ranking again. The Heavenly Physique Rankings and the Bloodline Rankings?”
 The appearance of the new rankings immediately attracted the attention of countless people in the Immortal Martial World.
 Many people were no longer unfamiliar with the Physique Rankings, and it was not difficult to understand the Bloodline Rankings.
 However, the Heavenly Physique Rankings and Bloodline Rankings were still something to look forward to.
 After all, they wanted to see what other powerful physiques and bloodlines there were in the myriad worlds.
 At the same time, in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 The Sons of Destiny’s phenomenon had only disappeared for an hour when the rankings suddenly flourished with golden light.
  Immediately, rows of golden words appeared below the 50th Great Expanse Dao Body.
 Physique Rankings # 50: Great Expanse Dao Body
 Owner 1: Kong Jia
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family
 Owner 2: Sun Bingtian
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Sun Family
 Owner 3: Jiang Li
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Grand Unity Immortal Sect
 Owner 4: Wu Wanli
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds, Human Immortal Holy Land
 Owner 5: Su Mu
 
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 “The Physique Rankings are finally releasing!”
 “I didn’t expect this Great Expanse Dao Body to have five owners!”
 “Five isn’t much. Among the countless living beings in the myriad worlds, only five possess such a physique!”
 “There are probably at most one or two in front!”
 “If the first-place human body is really just an ordinary human body, wouldn’t there be countless owners?”
 “Yeah, but I think it’s definitely not an ordinary human body. There must be a secret behind it!”
     

 Seeing that the Heavenly Physique Rankings had begun to be released, countless people from the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings with interest and discussed animatedly.
 Of course, what they looked forward to the most was the owner of the first ‘human body’.
 This was a suspense that had kept them in suspense for a month.
 Now, the truth was finally revealed.
 “Hey, look. The background of the fifth owner of the Great Expanse Dao Body is so strange. What does that mean?”
 “Yeah, if you didn’t mention it, I wouldn’t have noticed. There’s really nothing strange in the world. I’ve heard of Holy Lands, Dao Sects, and Immortal Sects. This is the first time I’ve heard of a ‘Large’!”
 “Hahaha, what kind of sect is this?”
 Countless gazes were successfully attracted by Su Mu’s background, and they were puzzled.
 …
 Immortal Martial World, Qingyun Sect.
 The corners of Li Yu’s mouth twitched when he saw all the information about the owner of the Great Expanse Dao Body that appeared on the Heavenly Physique Rankings.
 F*ck, is there a f*cking limit to the length of the characters on the Heavenly Dao Rankings? It’s actually missing one word. Must it be so f*cked up?  Li Yu regretted asking his father to change the sect’s name back.
 This was an embarrassment.
 That’s Quite a Large Sect had become That’s Quite a Large. The difference was worlds apart.
 However, this was good news. His father had gotten what he wanted. This name had a good concealment effect.
 How could anyone know what ‘That’s Quite a Large’ was?
 Murong Xingqiao was stunned when she saw Su Mu’s background, and then she looked at Li Yu with a strange expression.
 Thinking back to when that sect first appeared on the Hidden Dragon Rankings, many people were puzzled for a while.
 The name of this sect would probably confuse countless living beings in the myriad worlds.
 At this moment, the rankings gave out the rewards for the 50th person.
 With 500 years of cultivation, his comprehension and soul power had doubled.
 As a golden light flew over, Su Mu’s body was bathed in it. Immediately, he sat cross-legged and began to digest the mysterious power contained in the golden light.
 At the same time, the Heavenly Physique Rankings began to announce the owners of the rankings.
 Furthermore, each physique basically had four to five owners, with the highest being seven.
 From the 35th place onwards, each physique only had two to three owners.
 “Senior Brother Ji, your Connate Sword Body should be in the top thirty at least!” Su Mu said with a smile.
 In the Great Xia Dynasty’s 3000 Physique Rankings, Ji Qinglan’s physique was ranked ahead of Su Mu, so Ji Qinglan’s physique could definitely be on the rankings.
     

 He just did not know what his ranking would be.
 “Not necessarily. It’ll probably be my turn soon!” Ji Qinglan said humbly.
 In fact, he did not expect that although he was only one place away from the Great Expanse Dao Body, there was a huge difference in the rankings of the myriad worlds.
 Now that he was almost at 30th place, Ji Qinglan was looking forward to seeing his Connate Sword Body.
 Physique Rankings # 29: Connate Sword Body
 Owner 1: Li Xiaoyao
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Li Family
 Owner 2: Ji Qinglan
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 “Haha, Senior Brother, I guessed right. You’re in the top 30! Congratulations, Senior Brother!” Su Mu said happily.
 Ji Qinglan smiled knowingly. He was also satisfied with this outcome. He did not expect his physique to really enter the top 30.
 “Congratulations, Junior Brother Ji. Your Connate Sword Body is indeed extraordinary to be ranked in the top thirty of the Heavenly Physique Rankings!” Gu Yuqi patted Ji Qinglan’s shoulder and said.
 “You don’t have to make fun of me. Your Ancient God Body is far above my physique. I think your physique might be in the top ten! And Senior Brother Ye’s Firmament Overlord Body must be in the top ten too!” Ji Qinglan said.
 “Hahaha, I hope so!” Ye Qiu said with anticipation. He also wanted to know what rank the Firmament Overlord Body he had obtained was.
 However, he was confident in his physique. It was definitely extraordinary, and he might really have a place in the top ten.
 “I’m looking forward to seeing our Eldest Senior Brother’s physique on the rankings the most!”
 “Eldest Senior Brother’s human body is probably at the top again. Hahaha, this will broaden the horizons of the myriad worlds!” As everyone chatted, the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings fused into Ji Qinglan’s body.
 Ji Qinglan immediately meditated on the spot and began to absorb the mysterious power.
 At the moment, many people in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm noticed Ji Qinglan’s background again.
 “Another person from that sect is on the rankings? I didn’t expect this strange sect to be so extraordinary. There are actually two people on the rankings!”
 “Looks like this sect isn’t simple either!”
 “Yeah, no one from the lower realm has appeared since the 35th place. I didn’t expect another person from the lower realm to appear in the 29th place!”
 “This should be the last person from the lower realm. There probably won’t be anyone from the lower realm before the 30th place!”
 “Hmm, any further ahead is the Saint Body. It’s impossible for such a powerful physique to appear in the mortal world!”
  Indeed, no one from the lower realm came from the 28th to 20th place on the Physique Rankings. Furthermore, there was only one person with each physique.
 Physique Rankings # 20: Fusang Saint Body
 Owner: Heavenly Venerable Caiwei
 Origin: Flower Realm
 Reward: One thousand years of cultivation, four times increase in comprehension and soul power. One Saint King Bone
 “The Flower Realm is still around?”
 “That’s right. I didn’t expect that the Flower Realm Master hadn’t died. Rumor has it that back then, Heavenly Venerable Caiwei was killed by Heavenly Venerable Li Huo and the Dark Prison Demon Lord, and the Flower Realm was destroyed because of that! I didn’t expect that Heavenly Venerable Caiwei wouldn’t die!”
 …
    
Chapter 229: Proud Parasite  The destruction of the Flower Realm back then and its eventual collapse was definitely a major event that shook the heavens. Therefore, many people in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm knew about it.
 As for why the Flower Realm was destroyed, not many people knew.
 However, the struggles between the various worlds in the Nine Heavens were similar to the struggles between the various large sects, families, and factions in the Immortal Realm.
 It would never stop. Even though the Immortal Realm seemed peaceful on the surface, undercurrents were still surging.
 No one knew if any large faction would suddenly be destroyed one day.
 Li Fire Realm, Great Yan Palace.
 A stooped old man with a sinister expression looked at the golden scroll in the sky, killing intent surfacing in his eyes. “She’s still alive!”
  The old man was wearing a Fire Cloud Totem robe. His hair was white, and the ground beneath his feet was charred. The myriad of halls behind him floated above the magma.
 for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 The entire world was filled with flames and destructive auras, as if it was purgatory.
 This old man was Heavenly Venerable Li Huo.
 “Hmph, since you’re not dead, I’ll refine your Fusang Saint Body into a walking stick this time!” A sinister smile appeared on Heavenly Venerable Li Huo’s cold face.
 At this moment, a slender man with flames burning in his hair flew over.
 At first glance, it was as if a torch had flown over and landed in front of Heavenly Venerable Li Huo. He bowed and said, “My lord, someone from the Gongshu family of the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm just arrived. They said that they have news about the Flower Realm!”
 Heavenly Venerable Li Huo looked at the man in front of him as if he was looking at a fool. Then, he looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings and said, “Do I need them to tell me this?”
 “My lord, they say they know where the Flower Realm fell!” The man with the flaming hair added.
 “Oh? Tell him to come and see me!” Heavenly Venerable Li Huo sneered.
 Meanwhile, in the Black Mist Mountain Range, Gu Caiwei looked at the Heavenly Physique Rankings in the sky with a grave expression.
 She did not have to think to know that this ranking could probably be seen in all the worlds. In other words, Heavenly Venerable Li Huo must know that she was not dead yet.
 It was not difficult for him to find Li Yu with his current strength.
 Although she had already seen through life and death, she did not wish to die in the hands of her enemy, nor did she want the last living being of the Flower Realm to die in the hands of that old demon.
 In this way, Qing Ye’s death would be in vain.
 However, she was not even a third of her original strength. She was no longer a match for Li Huo.
 “Qingyun, leave the Flower Realm and return to your world. I can’t implicate you anymore!” Gu Caiwei said earnestly.
     

 Li Qingyun’s expression was calm. He knew what Gu Caiwei was worried about. He smiled and said, “Don’t worry. If Heavenly Venerable Li Huo dares to come, I’ll take revenge for you!”
 “You’re not his match at all. Qingyun, I appreciate your kindness. Although you’ve already stepped into the Perfected Immortal realm, the power of Heavenly Venerable Li Huo is beyond imagination. You still have a long way to go. It’s not worth it for the Flower Realm!” Gu Caiwei added.
 “Haha, I naturally know that I’m not Heavenly Venerable Li Huo’s match, but have you forgotten that I, Li Qingyun, have a good son? Hahaha!” Li Qingyun boasted shamelessly.
 Li Qingyun never got tired of leeching off his son like a parasite.
 Gu Caiwei looked at Li Qingyun and smiled. At this moment, the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings fused into her body.
 Gu Caiwei immediately sat cross-legged and began to absorb the rewards of the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 At the same time, the Heavenly Physique Rankings continued to update.
 Physique Rankings # 19: Earth Saint Body
 Owner: Heavenly Venerable Zhong Yue
 Origin: Heavy Mountain Realm
 Reward: 1000 years of cultivation, four times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Saint King Bone.
 Physique Rankings # 18: Stellar Saint Body
 Owner: Limitless Star Lord
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Limitless Star Palace
 Reward: 1000 years of cultivation, four times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Saint King Bone.
 Physique Rankings # 17: Emperor Flame Holy Body
  Owner: Flame Emperor
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Great Flame Empire
 Reward: 1000 years of cultivation, four times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Saint King Bone.
 …
 “Next is His Majesty’s physique!” An elder stroked his beard in the Dragon King Palace.
 Beside him, Dragon King Ao Ye was thinking about something else. “According to the ancestral records, if one obtains ten Great Dao inscriptions at the same time, he can directly condense a god’s true body and jump out of the Six Paths of Reincarnation to transcend the world and ascend to the legendary God Realm!”
 “Mm, there should be no mistake about what’s recorded in the ancestral records. However, it’s not easy to obtain ten Great Dao inscriptions at the same time! You have to find at least ten Sons of Destiny! And you have to successfully seize the Great Dao inscriptions in their bodies. It’s said that the failure rate is very high!” the elder said in a low voice.
 “It’s worth a try. Our men have already gathered. We’ll head to the 3000 Lower Realms soon!” Ao Ying’s eyes sparkled.
 Transcending reincarnation and standing above the heavens was naturally the dream of many.
 Although they had long lifespans, they could not escape the restraints of heaven and earth and the lightning tribulation that occurred every ten thousand years.
     

 Like a bird in a cage or a prisoner on a stake, life and death were not in their hands.
 Therefore, countless living beings in the world pursued the Great Dao for nothing more than greater power and higher authority. They wanted to escape from this cage and even become gods who controlled the world.
 “Our enemy this time isn’t those Sons of Destiny, but other factions!” the elder added.
 “Yes, in the struggle for the Great Dao, our greatest threat has never been this world, but that group of people like us. Another bloody storm is inevitable in this struggle for the Great Dao’s inscriptions. However, if our Dragon King Hall can’t obtain it, the other factions can forget about obtaining it easily!” Ao Ying’s gaze became increasingly cold.
 As they spoke, the next owner of the physique was announced.
 Physique Rankings # 16: Heavenly Dragon Saint Body
 Owner 1: Ao Ye
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Dragon King Hall
 Owner 2: Ao Li’ao
 Origin: Burial Earth World
 “The eighteenth ancestor is still alive! This is great!”
 “How could it be in the Burial Earth World?”
 Seeing the second owner appear on the rankings, Dragon King Ao Ye and the elder were first shocked before they were overjoyed.
 Ao Li’ao was the eighteenth generation ancestor of their Dragon King Hall, and he was also the person who grasped a lost technique of the Dragon King Hall.
 According to the records, his whereabouts were unknown after entering the Ten Realms Crack in the Chaotic Star Domain.
 They thought that he had already died, but they did not expect him to still be alive.
 If they could find him, they could complete the three important missing chapters of the Primordial Ancestral Dragon Art of their Dragon King Hall.
 “Come, quick, send our eighteen saints to the Burial Earth World to find the eighteen ancestors!” Ao Ye ordered excitedly.
 Physique Rankings # 15: Numinous Treasure Holy Body
 Owner: Gongshu Jin
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family
 Reward: 1500 years of cultivation, five times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Paragon Bone.
  “Congratulations, Father. You’ve just entered the rankings!” Gongshu Qitian walked in from outside the hall and cupped his hands.
 As for Gongshu Jin, who was sitting in the hall, he only nodded slightly and was not too happy.
 After all, it was already known that he was on the rankings.
 Furthermore, he was in a hurry to arrange the search for the Sons of Destiny. This was the top priority, a competition between the various families.
 “Let’s do as I say. Gongshu Dijie, you’ll lead the team to be in charge of the twelve worlds of the Jingxing Realm, the Taihe Realm, and the Ziluo Realm!” Gongshu Jin began to assign people.
 Gongshu Dijie was one of the Gongshu family’s 72 Golden Immortals. He was also the elite among all the Golden Immortal experts of the Gongshu family.
 This time, the Gongshu family sent out all 36 Heavenly Constellation Immortals and 72 Golden Immortals. Each led a team of Perfected Immortals and Exalted Immortals to the lower realm.
 …
    
Chapter 230: This Sect Is Not Simple  As they spoke, the Heavenly Dao Rankings reward fused into Gongshu Jin’s body. He quickly learned the content of the reward.
 He was pleasantly surprised. This reward was not bad, especially the Paragon Bone. It was an extremely precious reward for him.
 “Alright, you can distribute the rest yourselves. I’m going into seclusion to fuse with the Heavenly Dao reward!” Gongshu Jin said.
 Everyone bowed in response and left.
 “Lord Dijie, which world do you plan to go to first?” A man asked.
 “I plan to go to the Jingxing Realm first. My intuition tells me that there must be the Sons of Destiny there! Where is Lord Diyong?” Gongshu Yujie asked with a smile.
 “I haven’t thought about it yet! I’m going back to find Elder Hu Fu for a divination!” Gongshu Diyong said.
  “This time, every family will probably send many immortals to the lower realm. Those mortals will probably be scared silly!”
 “Haha, that’s right. They’ve probably never seen an immortal in their lives. This time, we can enjoy the joy of abusing our power in the lower realm!” Gongshu Dijie said.
 “That’s right! Hahaha…” The group of Golden Immortals laughed as they walked into the distance.
 The appearance of the Sons of Destiny caused undercurrents to surge in the myriad worlds. Even if the rankings were released, it did not stop the various families from moving.
 The various factions sent a large number of people to the lower realm to search for clues regarding the Sons of Destiny.
 As the immortals sent by the various families descended into the lower realm, the Heavenly Physique Rankings were gradually announced to tenth place.
 Physique Rankings # 10: Connate Saint Body
 
 Physique Owner 1: Heavenly Venerable Xuan He
 Origin: Sky Water Realm
 Physique Owner 2: Situ Shuiyue
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Situ Family
 “Heavenly Venerable Xuan He has a Connate Saint Body too!” In the Situ Residence, a woman in a white dress stood on the pavilion and looked at the rankings in the sky.
 She was Situ Shuiyue, Situ Nan’s daughter, ranked fifth on the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm’s Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 At the moment, all the disciples of the Situ family in the 16 cities were slightly restless. This was because Situ Shuiyue was on the rankings, and the Sky Water Realm Master was also on it.
 “I wonder when I can become an expert like Heavenly Venerable Xuan He!” Situ Shuiyue murmured softly. They were both Connate Saint Bodies, and Heavenly Venerable Xuan He was the master of a world. His Heavenly Venerable cultivation was the true peak expert in the myriad worlds.
     

 At the moment, Situ Shuiyue was slightly excited and honored to see that Heavenly Venerable Xuan He possessed the same physique as her.
 She seemed to have found her goal.
 Situ Shuiyue’s gaze moved away from Heavenly Venerable Xuan He’s name, and her limpid eyes stopped at the ‘human body’ at the top of the rankings.
 This was the physique she was most looking forward to and curious about today. There was also the ‘Type A’ bloodline on the Bloodline Rankings.
 She really wanted to know who could possess such a strange physique. Could the owners of these two be the same person or the same group of people?
 During this period of time, there were various different guesses about the human body and Type A bloodline in the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm. There were also explanations from the Deva Sect Master.
 The various explanations added some thought to this physique and bloodline, making Situ Shuiyue curious.
 Of course, there were many others who had the same idea as Situ Shuiyue.
 The various ancient families, the Primordial Royal Family, the eternal factions, and even many Realm Masters and Heavenly Venerables were looking forward to seeing who the first place was.
 Physique Rankings # 9: Void Divine Body
 Physique Owner: Evernight Heavenly Venerable
 Origin: Night God Realm
 At the moment, the Evernight Heavenly Venerable was standing on the Purple Star Platform with his hands behind his back, staring at the various Physique Rankings in the sky.
 As the Realm Master and a supreme Heavenly Venerable, he was not too interested in the rankings.
 He could only stare at the ‘Human Body’ at the top of the Physique Rankings and the ‘Type A’ bloodline on the Bloodline Rankings that aroused his curiosity.
 He could not help but look forward to the announcement of the first place.
 “Congratulations, Master!” A voice sounded from behind him. Immediately, a curvy woman in a black dress walked over.
 Her face was covered by a thin veil, and her almond-shaped eyes were as bright as the stars. Her beautiful hair was decorated with masters emitting silver halos. From afar, her hair was like the night sky, filled with stars.
 “Tian Shu, you’ve come at the right time. Master has a magic treasure for you!” With a wave of Evernight Heavenly Venerable’s hand, three black pearls appeared in front of him, emitting an extraordinary aura.
 The woman called Tian Shu’s eyes brightened as she stared at the three pearls in surprise.
 “This is a true natural divine artifact and my master’s strongest magic treasure, the Night God Pearl. This Night God Pearl is a strange object that coexists with heaven and earth.”
 There were a total of five pearls: First Night, Late Night, Remnant Night, Dark Night, and Eternal Night.
 Each contained a law of the night with boundless power.
 Her master had only achieved what he had today because of the Eternal Night God Pearl. Later on, he was fortunate enough to obtain the two pearls, Late Night and Remnant Night.
 They were still short of First Night and Dark Night.
 “Since you’re going to the Ancient Road to Heaven this time, I’ll give you this Late Night God Pearl. It should be able to help you pass through the Ancient Road to Heaven!”
 “Thank you, Master!” Tian Shu received the Night God Pearl from the Heavenly Venerable and was extremely excited.
     

 This was a divine artifact, the strongest treasure in the world.
 “Master, have you never found the other two divine pearls?” Tian Shu asked.
 “Hmm, perhaps it’s in a certain chaotic void!” said the Evernight Heavenly Venerable. He also wanted to find the other two pearls. Perhaps he could solve the mystery of heaven and earth and truly reach the realm of a god.
 As they spoke, a white-robed man embroidered with a black star totem walked in. He bowed and cupped his hands. “Realm Master, I just received news from the Night God Palace in the lower realm. A Sons of Destiny has appeared in the Night God Palace in the Jingxing Realm!”
 Hearing this, a trace of joy appeared in the eyes of the Evernight Heavenly Venerable. “Very good. Immediately send someone to bring them into the Night God Realm!”
 “Yes, my lord!”
 …
 In the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, after the owner of the Void Divine Body was announced, everyone’s gazes gathered on the eighth-ranked Firmament Overlord Body, their eyes filled with anticipation.
 This was a famous and powerful physique, and what made it famous was its exclusive owner, the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor.
 Previously, when everyone saw this physique on the rankings, they guessed that Ancient Emperor Qing Cang might not have died.
 And the answer was about to be announced today…
 In the Immortal Martial World, Qingyun Sect.
 Su Mu, Tang Chi, Gu Yuqi, Ji Qinglan, Ye Qiu, and the others looked at the rankings eagerly.
 “Junior Brother, you guys are awesome. Your Firmament Overlord Body and Ancient God Body are already in the top ten!” Tang Chi hugged Ye Qiu and Gu Yuqi’s shoulders and smiled.
 On the other hand, Gu Yuqi and Ye Qiu were a little nervous, but they were looking forward to it more. They also wanted to know what their physiques could rank in.
 Furthermore, when they thought of the countless powerful immortals and living beings in the various worlds paying attention to this ranking, their blood inexplicably boiled.
 Finally…
 Physique Rankings # 8: Firmament Tyrant Body
 Owner: Ye Qiu
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 “Beautiful, hahaha, Junior Brother Ye, you’re too awesome. You’re in eighth place!” Tang Chi hugged Ye Qiu and shook him. He was so excited that it was as if he was the one on the rankings.
 “Congratulations, Senior Brother!” Everyone congratulated him.
  Ye Qiu was also overjoyed. He was proud of himself. When he thought of the expressions of the big shots of the heavens when they saw that the eighth place was from the lower realm, they must be thrilled.
 As Ye Qiu had expected, countless people in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, Luo Heaven Immortal Realm, the Mixed Heaven Immortal Realm, and other immortal realms were also shocked when they saw Ye Qiu’s background.
 When they saw that the owner of the Firmament Overlord Body was not the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor, they were already shocked.
 However, after seeing Ye Qiu’s name, they thought that he was from the Ancient Family of the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, the Ye family, and that he might be lucky enough to obtain the inheritance of the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor.
 In the end, when they saw Ye Qiu’s background, their jaws dropped.
 What was even more shocking was that this person’s background was actually the same as the owner of the Connate Sword Body. He was also from that strange sect.
 for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 “It’s this sect again!”
 “This That’s Quite a Large isn’t simple!”
    
Chapter 231: How Should We Interpret This?  “Is Ye Qiu a member of the Ye family who wandered into the lower realm?”
 “That’s possible. Otherwise, how could such a powerful physique appear in the lower realm!”
 Countless people in the Immortal Realm tried to comfort themselves.
 Otherwise, they really could not understand what they had seen.
 From the 28th place on the rankings, no one from the lower realm could be seen.
 They never imagined that someone from the lower realm would suddenly appear in eighth place.
 8th!
  How many mighty figures and top experts had been suppressed by this ranking?
 In front of him was the Patriarch of the Ancient Family, the top prodigy of the Ancient Family, and the high and mighty Realm Master Heavenly Venerable.
 In the end, a person from the lower realm suddenly appeared here.
 This made the immortals lose face, so they were absolutely unwilling to believe that Ye Qiu was a mortal from the lower realm.
 However, the people from the Ye Family in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm were also in an uproar. Many people guessed that Ye Qiu might be a member of their Ye Family.
 Even the Ye family’s master, Ye Tianxing, felt that Ye Qiu was definitely a member of their Ye family who had wandered into the lower realm. He even immediately sent people to investigate all the branches of the family to confirm if any Ye family disciples had really wandered into the lower realm.
 “Ye Qiu!” Ye Cheng looked at the name on the rankings and frowned slightly.
 
 For some reason, he was slightly jealous of Ye Qiu. The difference of one word was like heaven and earth.
 ‘If I can possess the Firmament Overlord Body, I’ll definitely have the qualifications to compete with Gongshu Qitian, Qin Feng, and the others.’ Ye Cheng pondered.
 Now that the various ancient families of the Grand Desolate Immortal Realm had produced geniuses, the Qin family and the Gongshu family had produced unprecedented geniuses.
 Even Situ Shuiyue from the Situ family did not lose to them by much.
 As a Divine Son, he seemed useless compared to them.
 They were both from ancient families and were all divine children.
 They would inevitably be compared and commented on. Although Ye Cheng did not say it, he was filled with jealousy and unwillingness.
 He, who had always been careful and proud, naturally could not stand the difference now and was unwilling to look up to it.
 “That’s Quite a Large? Which world is it in?” Ye Cheng narrowed his eyes slightly.
     

 …
 Qin Family’s Heavenly Star Palace, Star Seizer Tower.
 Qin Jingyun, Qin Jingtao, and the others from the Qin family drank tea while admiring the Heavenly Physique Rankings outside.
 Although they admired him, they were actually quite nervous.
 It had already announced the eighth place, but Qin Feng was not on the rankings yet. Clearly, his physique was at the top.
 However, what kind of physique was it? This was a question that they had been curious about for many years. It was finally about to be revealed today.
 The Desolate Saint Body, the Eternal Divine Body, the Primordial Divine Body, and the Grand Ancestral Divine Body seemed possible. It was even possible for that mysterious “human body”.
 “I didn’t expect a physique like the Firmament Overlord Body to appear in the lower realm!”
 “He’s probably the successor of the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor. I can only say that this person is very lucky to obtain the inheritance of the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor!”
 “This time, the Ye family will probably publicize that this is someone from their family who fell into the lower realm!”
 “Hmm, the Ye family will probably look for this child everywhere and bring him back to the Ye family to announce that he’s a member of their family!”
 “How could the Ye family do such a thing?” Qin Jingyun and the others laughed.
 “Hmph, that Ye Cheng probably wishes he could become Ye Qiu!” Qin Feng sneered.
 “The next is the Desolate Saint Body. I wonder if it’s Feng’er’s physique!” Qin Jingyun seemed calm, but he was actually looking at the Heavenly Dao Rankings nervously.
 Physique Rankings # 7: Desolate Saint Body
 Owner: Jun Wuhui
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Jun Family
  “So he’s from the Jun family of the Luo Heaven Immortal Realm!” Qin Jingyun heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that his son had at least a divine body that was more powerful than a sacred body.
 This made him feel more at ease. Although the first place human body sounded awful, it would be good if he could become the top and suppress the Chaos Divine Body.
 “This person seems to be the current son of the Jun Family!” Qin Jingtao remarked.
 “That’s right. This Jun Family’s divine son is extremely famous in the entire Luo Heaven Immortal Realm. It’s said that he possesses invincible talent and the strength to sweep through the current era!” Another Qin Family member said.
 “Hmph, that’s because the elites of the Luo Heaven Immortal Realm are too weak. Come to our Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm and you’ll probably know who’s invincible in this era!”
 “It’s also said that his appearance and aura are stunning and extraordinary!”
 “Hehe, there are a lot of rumors about this Divine Son. I wonder if they’re true!” Everyone laughed.
 “They’re here. The sixth place is about to be announced!” Everyone’s attention was focused on the rankings again.
 Qin Feng stared at the golden light on the rankings and slowly gathered a name.
 Physique Rankings # 6: Eternal Divine Body
 Owner: Qin Feng
     

 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Qin Family
 “Eternal Divine Body! Mine is the Eternal Divine Body?” Qin Feng had mixed feelings. He seemed happy, but for some reason, he felt disappointed.
 Perhaps it was because he had higher expectations in the past.
 However, after knowing his physique, Qin Feng finally felt relieved.
 No matter what, his physique was already extraordinary.
 “So Feng’er has the Eternal Divine Body! Haha, not bad, not bad!” Qin Jingyun laughed heartily, even though he felt the same disappointment as Qin Feng.
 However, there was also the same joy.
 The Qin family was also overjoyed. The question that had puzzled them for many years was finally answered.
 At the moment, many people in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm were also discussing the extraordinary son of the Qin family. Everyone in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm knew about the various extraordinary events when Qin Feng was born.
 Of course, Qin Feng was really strong. He, who could be compared to Gongshu Qitian, did not disappoint them.
 Although the Eternal Divine Body was ranked sixth, no one dared to underestimate it.
 The difference in physique and strength between the top few was probably not too great. If not for the Heavenly Dao ranking, it was still unknown who would be stronger in a competition.
 “Next is the Primordial Divine Body. I wonder who has the physique?” Countless people from the Immortal Realm looked at the rankings with anticipation.
 After all, they were already in the top five. Those who could be on the rankings were definitely extraordinary.
 Physique Rankings # 5: Primordial Divine Body
 Owner: Gu Yuqi
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Silence rang out.
 The entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm seemed to fall silent for a moment as everyone looked at the person on the rankings in surprise.
 It was this strange sect from the lower realm again!
 If they had seen Ye Qiu appear on the rankings previously, they could still link it to the members of the Ye family of the Primordial Era to explain everything and seek balance in their hearts.
 In that case, the Gu Yuqi in front of them had completely shattered their understanding.
 How should he interpret this?
  Another immortal from the lower realm?
 Was that the Immortal Realm’s homeless shelter?
 Furthermore, they were all stunning big shots!
 This clearly didn’t make sense!
 The Great Expanse Dao Body, the Connate Sword Body, the Firmament Overlord Body, and the Primordial Divine Body. How could a mere faction from the lower realm possess four people with special physiques on the rankings at the same time?
 Looking at the rankings, it was almost comparable to the number of people on their Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm’s top factions.
 What was more terrifying was that there were two physiques in the top ten.
 …
    
Chapter 232: The Gods’ Shelter  “Haha, Junior Brother Gu is on the rankings! Fifth place. Impressive. Eh, Primordial Divine Body? How did you become a Primordial Divine Body!” Tang Chi hugged Gu Yuqi excitedly and shook him.
 “Yeah, Junior Brother Gu, don’t you have an Ancient God Body?” Ji Qinglan and the others were also a little surprised.
 “I’m not sure either. Maybe my Ancient God Body awakened further and became the Primordial Divine Body. Or maybe it’s the same physique as the Primordial Divine Body!” Gu Yuqi scratched his head.
 “Haha, that’s not important. Who cares what physique he has? We’ve also occupied three of the top ten spots on the Heavenly Physique Rankings. Those mighty figures in the various worlds will probably be shocked to the point their jaws drop!” Tang Chi said excitedly.
 The corners of everyone’s mouths curled up as they nodded slightly, especially Ji Qinglan and Feng Xian. As people from the Immortal Realm, they could understand the feelings of those from the various Immortal Realms.
 This was because they were also shocked by their own sects time and time again. Furthermore, this was only the beginning. The subsequent rankings would probably make the various large factions of the Nine Heavens Immortal Realm explode in anger.
 Countless members of the Gongshu family discussed as they looked at the rankings in the sky. The elders were also shocked.
  “This strange faction isn’t simple!”
 “Looks like I have to investigate this faction properly!”
 At this moment, it was not only the Gongshu family. The Qin family, the Ye family, the Mo family, the Situ family, the Dragon King Hall, the Phoenix Ancient Cave, and the other members of the Primordial Imperial Family were also incomparably shocked.
 The top ten of the rankings were actually occupied by two spots by a strange faction from the lower realm. They could not help but find it unbelievable.
 It also piqued their interest in this strange faction.
 However, just as they thought that it was already shocking enough for this strange faction to occupy the top ten or two spots…
 Physique Rankings # 4: Phoenix Overlord Body
 
 Owner: Huo Wu
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Phoenix Ancient Cave
 Reward: 2000 years of cultivation, seven times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Paragon Bone
 Physique Rankings # 3: Grand Ancestral Divine Body
 Owner: Nie Yongan
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 “Heavens, it’s that lower realm faction again!”
 “This is unbelievable. The third place is actually that lower realm faction!”
 “Are you sure this is the same faction and not the same type of faction?”
 “That’s a little scary, right? How can there be so many powerful physiques in the lower realm? The third place’s Grand Ancestral Divine Body is also from the lower realm!”
 “Looks like the appearance of the Sons of Destiny is not a coincidence. It’s indeed a world of strife. I’m afraid a heaven-defying child is about to appear in the lower realm!”
 “This doesn’t seem to be good news for us!”
 “Why do I have a feeling that the first place might be from this lower realm faction!”
     

 “It can’t be. If the first place is too, that would be too scary!”
 “But judging from the strange name, it’s really possible!”
 At this moment, countless people in the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm could not calm down. They felt that their understanding had collapsed.
 The high and mighty Immortal Realm factions could not even compare to a faction from the lower realm.
 It was like a group of self-righteous developed countries suddenly seeing a primitive African tribe with nuclear weapons.
 Furthermore, they not only possessed nuclear weapons, but they also possessed a cosmic battleship that even they did not have.
 Not to mention having a mental breakdown, even his understanding was about to collapse.
 At this moment, the Heavenly Physique Rankings had clearly changed. Some arrogant immortals felt a sense of defeat.
 Furthermore, they were worried about the first place.
 A smile surfaced on the corners of the Deva Sect Master’s mouth. He should be the person in the Immortal Realm who looked forward to the first place being a mortal from the lower realm the most.
 This way, his previous speculations would be verified, and his ideals could be convinced.
 Otherwise, the Grandmaster of Heaven would definitely try to overturn his opinion from that day.
 “Is the first place really a mortal?” The Grandmaster of Heaven of the Heaven and Earth Sect had an ominous feeling.
 “That old fellow, Deva, has really gotten it right!” The Grandmaster of Heaven said indignantly.
 “This ranking is getting more and more interesting!” A smile surfaced on the corners of the Evernight Heavenly Venerable’s mouth.
 “Not bad, another target to possess!” An old man in the Fallen God Palace of the Netherworld Heaven Immortal Realm looked at the rankings greedily.
 At this moment, the anticipation of countless people and living beings for the first place had already surpassed the expectations of the second place.
 Almost everyone’s attention was on the first place.
  It made the Chaos Divine Body in second place become a punctuation-like existence.
 It did not affect anyone’s emotions at all.
 Physique Rankings # 2: Chaos Divine Body
 Owner: Gongshu Qitian
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family
 Reward: 2000 years of cultivation, eight times increase in comprehension and soul power, two Paragon Bones
 Physique Rankings # 1: Human Body
 Owner of Physique: Li Yu
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Reward: Secret
 Additional Reward: Secret
 “It’s really this lower realm faction!”
 “This is unbelievable!”
     

 “Li Yu!”
 “Could this human body really be the most ordinary mortal body? How is that possible!”
 “What kind of existence is that door?!”
 “The reward for first place is actually kept a secret!”
 “Why is there an additional reward?”
 After seeing that the first place was really from the lower realm, countless people from the Immortal Realm had mixed feelings and were shocked.
 However, they were even more confused about the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 How could a mere mortal’s body be ranked ahead of so many divine bodies?
 Furthermore, why was he the only one on the rankings? What was the difference between his human body and others?
 They needed an explanation from the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 At this moment, a row of golden annotated words appeared below the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 Physique Interpretation: Mastering extraordinary power with an ordinary physique, matching the gods of the heavens with a mortal body.
 Upon seeing this annotation and this row of words, everyone in the Immortal Realm could not calm down.
 It was really just a mortal body, the most ordinary human body.
 This was simply a slap in the face. Not only was the rankings slaughtered by this lower realm faction, but the first place was also a mortal.
 How could these high and mighty immortals endure this?
 According to the Heavenly Dao, if Li Yu cultivated his mortal body to an extremely powerful physique, he would ultimately only have a mortal body.
 Furthermore, they had never heard of anyone cultivating a mortal body into a powerful physique comparable to a god.
 This was simply shocking and unbelievable.
 “Hahaha, you didn’t disappoint me after all!” The Deva Sect Master was in a good mood.
 The interpretation given by the Heavenly Dao was somewhat different from his previous interpretation.
 However, there was not much difference. This meant that the theory he advocated was right.
 The human body was the physique with the greatest potential in the world, and humans were also the most powerful creatures in the world.
 “It’s only a mortal body? Isn’t the Heavenly Dao Rankings exaggerating a little? I don’t believe that a mortal body can really surpass my Chaos Divine Body no matter how much he cultivates!” Gongshu Qitian was unconvinced.
 If that human body did not mean what it sounded like and was an unknown powerful physique with this name, he would not be affected.
 However, now that the Heavenly Dao Rankings had clearly told him that he had lost to a mortal, he could no longer remain calm.
  Furthermore, he could not understand or believe that a mortal body could really compare to a god.
 “Li Yu!” Situ Shuiyue looked at Li Yu’s name, and her eyes were filled with surprise.
 She had a feeling that this must be a person and a sect with a story.
 If she had the chance, she wanted to go to the lower realm to see what kind of people they were.
 “A mortal body?” Huo Wu’s eyes flickered as her gaze finally stopped at the first place on the Bloodline Rankings.
 “Looks like the first place might be him too. Does that represent the mortal bloodline?”
 “How boring!” Qin Feng shook his head in disappointment. He thought that this human body was an unbelievable physique, but it was just a mortal body.
 “This lower realm faction is indeed interesting. There are indeed crouching tigers and hidden dragons. I’m getting curious!” The Evernight Heavenly Venerable looked at Li Yu’s name with interest.
    
Chapter 233: Invincible Heavenly Dao Reward  “I didn’t expect Elder Nie’s body to be the Grand Ancestral Divine Body!”
 “Wow, Elder Nie is in third place!” Tang Chi, Ji Qinglan, Su Mu, and the others were also pleasantly surprised.
 They did not expect Elder Nie’s body to have such a powerful physique.
 “Hahaha, this is too awesome. Our sect has actually dominated the rankings too!”
 Everyone was overjoyed. Not only did they dominate the Immortal Martial World’s rankings, but they also occupied many key positions on the Myriad Worlds Rankings, especially the top few.
 It was as if a person thought he was the richest man in the village, only to discover that he was also the richest man in the world.
 Although the Heavenly Physique Rankings had already ended, many people in the Immortal Realm could not calm down for a long time.
  Initially, there would not be any intense emotional fluctuations when they looked at the rankings. However, they did not expect the effect of the rankings to be so good.
 Not to mention that the rankings were slaughtered by an unknown faction in the lower realm.
 The first place’s human body was also a shocker.
 It made them feel restless.
 Moreover, judging from the current situation, the owner of the strange number one bloodline on the Bloodline Rankings was likely Li Yu. After all, their styles were uniform.
 It might even be an ordinary mortal bloodline.
 However, they could not understand how the most ordinary human body and bloodline could be ranked first by the Heavenly Dao.
 
 Even if he really cultivated his physical body to a high level through a certain cultivation method, how strong could a mere mortal body be?
 It was like an ant versus a divine dragon. If an ant’s body was cultivated to the extreme, could it suppress a divine dragon’s body?
 They could not understand.
 Of course, most people were only watching the show.
 In any case, it did not matter to them who got on the rankings. They could just laugh it off.
 What’s the point of thinking so much? They were not doing scientific research or writing a thesis here!
 Furthermore, there were all kinds of strange things in the world that did not follow logic.
 If he had to take it seriously, he would probably have to ask the heavens why they made themselves look so mediocre.
     

 After the Heavenly Physique Rankings were announced, the Bloodline Rankings were not announced immediately. Everything seemed to have settled temporarily.
 Immortal Martial World, Qingyun Sect.
 Li Yu felt comfortable bathing in the golden light of the Heavenly Dao. The reward from the Heavenly Dao Rankings was the Great Dao Golden Body.
 This golden body could absorb the power of all Great Dao and ignore all Dao technique attacks.
 At the same time, his body was the Great Dao that contained the true meaning of the three thousand Great Dao.
 It could be said that his body possessed the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree, the Dao Comprehension Stone, the Dao Comprehension Tea, the Great Dao auspicious cloud, and other functions. It was even superior to them.
 His body naturally emitted the power of the Great Dao, and rich Dao runes lingered around him.
 Any sound he made contained the true meaning of the Great Dao. Even his breath was the purest immortal energy in the world.
 If one came into close contact with it, the more one could comprehend the true meaning and mysteries of the Great Dao.
 ‘I keep feeling that I’ll be the center of attention in the future!’
 Countless people wanted to hug him to comprehend the Great Dao and imagine the scene…
 He could not help but sweat profusely.
 However, it had to be said that the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings were getting more and more explosive.
 The additional reward this time was also fragrant. It happened to form a perfect set meal with the Great Dao Golden Body.
 The additional reward was the Heart of Heaven and Earth.
  He could sense all the power in the world and control it. Coupled with the Great Dao Golden Body, he possessed the powerful ability to command the law.
 In the future, whoever Li Yu told to scram would never get lost.
 The Heavenly Physique Rankings were announced in less than two hours in the Immortal Realm.
 Meanwhile, two days had passed in the Immortal Martial World.
 With the generous rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings, Su Mu’s cultivation directly stepped into the peak of the Immortal Spirit Realm. He was already half a step into the Immortal Rankings.
 As for Ji Qinglan, he had also stepped into the Perfected Immortal realm. As for Gu Yuqi and Ye Qiu, they relied on the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings to ride the wind and directly broke through two major realms to enter the Golden Immortal realm.
 Elder Nie had also successfully stepped into the Heaven Immortal realm from the Perfected Immortal realm.
 …
 On this day, in the imperial palace of the Xi Liang Dynasty, drums, music, and flutes reverberated through the palace. Imperial maids with graceful figures fluttered and swayed.
 A man with sharp brows and starry eyes sat on the dragon couch with an extraordinary aura. As for the Xi Liang Dynasty’s Emperor, Ji Tianchang, and the ministers and the Ji family’s cultivators, they were kneeling at the side.
 This man was none other than one of the Golden Immortals sent by the Gongshu family to the Mystic Realm, Gongshu Dijie. Standing behind him were the few immortals who had followed him here.
     

 Gongshu Dijie reached out and picked up a spirit fruit from the fruit platter served by the palace maid. He took a bite and immediately spat it out.
 Then, he threw the fruit back into the fruit bowl.
 He glanced at the swaying palace maids below with a bored expression.
 “Alright, send these ordinary women down! There are no surprises in the lower realm!”
 After Gongshu Dijie arrived in the Jingxing Realm, he happened to appear in the Xi Liang Dynasty.
 Therefore, he went straight to the Xi Liang Imperial Palace and prepared to let these native mortals run errands for him to find clues about the Sons of Destiny.
 At the same time, he could enjoy the joy of being a tyrant. However, he did not expect that the lower realm was the lower realm. The food was not delicious, the wine was not delicious, and the women were all ordinary.
 He was really not interested, and the people who displeased him the most were the mortals in front of him.
 For some reason, he felt that the reactions and expressions of these mortals when they saw him were completely different from what he had imagined.
 It was as if something was missing in their eyes.
 Although they were all kneeling respectfully in front of him, there was no fear or shock in their eyes. They were even calm.
 It was like the difference in the way a young girl looked at a man.
 Did they get so scared that they forgot about their fear??Gongshu Dijie thought to himself.
 Regardless, he still felt a little unhappy.
 If he did not need these native mortals to help him obtain information, he would really like to let them experience how terrifying the power of a Golden Immortal was.
 It made them tremble in front of him.
 “Mortal Emperor, let me ask you something!”
 Gongshu Dijie looked at Ji Tianchang angrily.
 “Did you see the natural phenomenon not long ago? Thousands of golden clouds surfaced, and various wonders were faintly discernible. In the end, the multicolored light slowly gathered into a giant scroll, and countless obscure and complicated golden characters transformed into flowing lights that filled the sky and flew away!”
 “I see it. You’re talking about the Sons of Destiny, right?” Ji Tianchang asked.
  Upon hearing Ji Tianchang’s words, Gongshu Yujie felt uneasy again.
 He gave a long explanation, afraid that these mortals would not understand if he used professional terms.
 In the end, he knew about the Sons of Destiny.
 This made him seem a little foolish!
 “You know about the Sons of Destiny?” Gongshu Yujie was a little surprised, but it was a good thing. It seemed that this mortal emperor knew something.
 “Yes, but I also heard that the Great Xia Dynasty’s Qingyun Sect produced a Son of Destiny. I only found out about the Sons of Destiny after hearing this rumor!” Ji Tianchang said.
 This news was not a secret to begin with, and many surrounding countries knew about it.
 Furthermore, Ji Tianchang believed that these guests from the Immortal Realm had ill intentions. He could not deal with them anymore, so he could only send them into the tiger’s den.
    
Chapter 234: Kneel  “Really?” Gongshu Yujie was pleasantly surprised.
 He did not expect himself to be so lucky to find out about the Sons of Destiny is soon as he arrived in the lower realm.
 This was an auspicious sign, indicating that his trip to the lower realm would be smooth sailing.
 If he could keep going smoothly, he might find the most Sons of Destiny. Then, he would definitely be rewarded when he returned, and his status in the Gongshu family would surely improve in the future.
 This happiness came too suddenly, and he almost got carried away.
 “Mm, I shouldn’t be wrong!” Ji Tianchang confirmed.
 His two sons were in the Qingyun Sect. How could he not know about this?
  “Very good. Quickly send someone to inform the Qingyun Sect to bring that Son of Destiny over to see me!” Gongshu Yujie ordered.
 “This…” Ji Tianchang hesitated.
 He thought that they would head to the Qingyun Sect after he told them the news so that he could send these arrogant fellows away.
 He did not expect these guys to stay here and not leave.
 “What? You can’t even do such a small thing?” Gongshu Yujie’s expression turned cold.
 He was a Golden Immortal from the Immortal Realm. Wouldn’t it be too embarrassing for him to personally visit?
 Furthermore, in his opinion, even if that person was the chosen one, he was only a mortal from the lower realm.
 If this Golden Immortal wanted to see him, he would definitely come over excitedly.
 “Alright, I’ll send someone to send the news now!” Ji Tianchang was helpless.
 He could only pray that the two sides did not fight. His palace had only been repaired for less than a year.
 Furthermore, the ones who came this time were from the Immortal Realm. If Li Yu really attacked, not only would these immortals be gone with a single strike, but his palace might also be gone.
 Gongshu Dijie looked at Ji Tianchang unhappily. It was his honor to let him run errands, and this mortal emperor still looked unwilling.
 This person from the lower realm really didn’t know how to respect immortals at all.
     

 Ji Tianchang called Yu Feng over and asked her to deliver the news to the Qingyun Sect. After all, Yu Feng was familiar with the route to the Qingyun Sect.
 After receiving the order, Yu Feng immediately rushed to the Qingyun Sect as soon as possible. She successfully met Ji Qinglan and informed him of the news.
 Knowing that guests from the Immortal Realm had occupied their Xi Liang Imperial Palace, Ji Qinglan was worried.
 “Is my father alright?” Ji Qinglan asked.
 “His Majesty is fine. They didn’t harm His Majesty! However, this group of people seem to be high and mighty. Even His Majesty has to kneel in front of them and serve them. I’m very displeased. These people are too arrogant. They simply treat us from the lower realm as ants!” Yu Feng said with a displeased expression.
 In her opinion, so what if he was an immortal? It was not like there were none in the Immortal Martial World.
 ‘Do you have to pretend like that? As if I’m a god who must be worshiped by mortals?’
 Yu Feng did not know when her opinion of immortals had changed.
 “Don’t worry, I’ll report this to the sect master now. He’ll definitely deal with it!” Ji Qinglan assured.
 Ji Qinglan quickly reported this matter to Li Yu, who was not surprised at all.
 After all, this was within his expectations.
 “Haha, you’re faster than I thought. A fish has taken the bait so quickly!” Li Yu laughed.
 He had asked Feng Xian to release the news that day precisely for this day.
 Li Yu’s words puzzled Ji Qinglan. He did not know what Li Yu was up to.
  “Sect Master, can I go with you?” Ji Qinglan asked. He was worried about his father and family.
 Although he had regained his memories from his previous life, the kinship in this life was real. He would not forget it.
 “Yes, of course. Let Elder Nie come with us!” Li Yu did not know what level the other party was at this time, so he decided to make a trip personally.
 If Elder Nie and Ji Qinglan could handle it, he would watch from the sidelines.
 If the person was strong, he would come out and control the situation.
 Furthermore, only he knew about this plan at the moment. It was too troublesome to let only Elder Nie and the others go while he had to explain to them.
 Li Yu quickly called for the purple lightning flood dragon and prepared to bring Elder Nie, Ji Qinglan, and Yu Feng to the Xi Liang Dynasty.
 He chose to ride the purple lightning flood dragon because this fellow had been to the Xi Liang Dynasty before and was familiar with it.
 Standing on the purple lightning flood dragon, Yu Feng had mixed feelings.
     

 She had experienced a similar scene before. At that time, she and her master had brought Li Yu to the Xi Liang Dynasty to capture him.
 However, times had changed. Looking back, it was really laughable.
 Now, everything had already changed drastically, and her state of mind was completely different. Other than reverence for Li Yu, she had no other feelings for him.
 The purple lightning flood dragon’s flying speed was very fast. It arrived in an instant.
 This time, the purple lightning flood dragon flew above the Xi Liang Imperial Palace, and Li Yu and the others jumped down.
 Then, he followed Yu Feng to the hall where Gongshu Dijie and the others were.
 “Your Majesty, Immortal Venerables, the Qingyun Sect has arrived for you!” Feng Yu walked into the hall and bowed with cupped hands.
 However, Gongshu Dijie, who was sitting on the dragon bed, instantly focused his gaze on Li Yu, Elder Nie, and Ji Qinglan, and his eyes immediately revealed surprise.
 The three people in front of him were simply too extraordinary.
 The moment he saw them, he suddenly felt as if he had seen his son and the elites of the sequence.
 After sensing the other party’s aura with his divine sense, Gongshu Dijie, who was sitting on the dragon bed, stood up.
 One of them was a Heaven Immortal, and the other was a Perfected Immortal.
 As for the person in the lead, he looked ordinary like a mortal from the aura.
 However, he was the most extraordinary one among the three.
 He emitted the power of the Great Dao around him, and there was even a dense Dao rune lingering on the surface of his body. He stood there silently, but he was still like the center of the world, impossible to ignore.
 Furthermore, facing Li Yu now gave him the illusion that he was facing the Heavenly Dao embodiment.
 In fact, they were even more nervous and afraid than facing their master.
 He even felt that he was like an ant in front of him. He felt his legs go weak, and he was filled with fear.
  Li Yu’s gaze swept around indifferently before finally stopping on Gongshu Yujie.
 On the way here, he had heard that Gongshu Dijie was the same as a certain Asgardian God. He liked to make mortals kneel in front of him and enjoy the feeling of being high and mighty and being worshiped.
 At the moment, everyone was kneeling in the hall. Even Ji Qinglan’s father was kneeling there.
 As Ji Qinglan’s senior brother and a member of the Immortal Martial World, he felt the need to avenge Ji Qinglan and the people from the lower realm.
 He wanted to give this self-righteous guest from the Immortal Realm a show of strength so that it would be easier for them to talk.
 “Kneel!” Li Yu’s voice was indifferent, but his words were law. The terrifying power of heaven and earth and the laws of the Great Dao instantly enveloped Gongshu Dijie.
 It was as if the sky was pressing down on him, causing his heart to tremble and his soul to leave his body. He knelt on the ground with a plop.
 The sound of the Great Dao made him dizzy and cold. His eyes were filled with shock and fear!
    
Chapter 235: I Must Be in the Wrong Place  Gongshu Dijie was completely dumbfounded. He knelt on the ground, his eyes filled with shock and fear.
 He felt that Li Yu was like a god, and he was that ant, that speck of dust.
 The instinctive reverence made his heart tremble in fear.
 The few immortals who accompanied him did not face Li Yu’s pressure directly.
 However, they were also shocked by Li Yu’s extraordinary appearance until their faces turned pale. Their legs went limp as they stood at the side and trembled.
 Furthermore, they could sense the extraordinary auras of the two people behind Li Yu. They were immortals countless times stronger than them.
 Li Yu was satisfied with Gongshu Dijie’s reaction, and he was also satisfied with his new ability. It was simply necessary to show off.
  He looked at Ji Tianchang and the others, who were still kneeling, and said, “No one says that mortals have to kneel to immortals. All of you, stand up!”
 Ji Qinglan hurriedly stepped forward to help his father up.
 Ji Tianchang was grateful. He knew that with Li Yu around, everyone in the Immortal Martial World could stand tall and live.
 This was also the reason why they could remain calm even when facing this group of immortals.
 Li Yu was the backbone of all life in this world.
 At this moment, the hearts of the Ji Family members present were heavy.
 Although they knew that Li Yu was extraordinary, it was satisfying to see that the high and mighty man, who had been bossy not long ago, was frightened to the point of kneeling on the ground by a single word from Li Yu.
 Li Yu looked away, and the pressure on Gongshu Dijie weakened significantly.
 Gongshu Dijie, who had recovered from his shock, only had one thought in his mind.
 I must be in the wrong place. This can’t be the lower realm.  How can there be such an extraordinary and terrifying expert in the lower realm?  Am I crazy? Or is the world crazy?  “Who are you?” Li Yu looked at Gongshu Dijie and asked.
 “We, we are members of the Gongshu family of the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm’s Ancient Family. We are here today to find the Sons of Destiny. Our family is willing to invite all the Sons of Destiny to become our Gongshu family’s retainers!” Gongshu Yujie replied with a trembling voice.
     

 “What level is your family in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm?” Li Yu asked.
 His words confirmed that this person was not from the Immortal Realm. This was even more shocking. How could there be such an extraordinary person in the lower realm?
 ‘Did times really change?’
 ‘Is the lower realm already filled with Golden Immortals and Saints?’
 However, he suddenly understood something.
 Why did those mortals not look at him with any shock or fear?
 They had already seen immortals and immortals stronger than him.
 “Immortal Venerable, our Gongshu family is one of the strongest families in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm. It’s also the top family!” Gongshu Yujie replied truthfully.
 He was not bragging. The Gongshu family was definitely the top family and one of the strongest factions in the current Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 “Hmm, not bad. Is your family searching for the Sons of Destiny?” Li Yu asked.
 “Indeed. Our master appreciates talent and is willing to recruit talented people to develop the family together…”
 “Yes, I admire talent too!” Li Yu nodded. “Which one of you has the lowest status in the family?”
 Li Yu’s unreasonable words puzzled everyone. They looked at each other. Who was willing to admit that their status in the family was low?
 However, in the face of Li Yu’s question, they immediately pushed out someone. “Him! He has the lowest status!”
 Li Yu looked at the guy who looked like a punching bag and said, “Go back and tell your family head that I want to make a deal with him. Now, there are one, two, three… five people here, so I’ll stay. Please invite him to bring the Sons of Destiny over for the exchange. One for each person, the time limit is… three months. Our sect doesn’t raise idle people. If it’s late, I’ll clean up the sect!”
 Li Yu’s words delighted the person who had been pushed out, and the expressions of Gongshu Yujie and the others changed drastically as they turned pale with fright.
 You call this a deal?  This is kidnapping and blackmail, okay?  What kind of trick is this?  Gongshu Dijie was stunned for a moment and could not react in time.
 Ji Qinglan, Elder Nie, Ji Tianchang, and the others looked at each other in surprise.
 They finally understood Li Yu’s intention for releasing the news. He also wanted to find those Sons of Destiny, but he was unwilling to search for them himself.
 Therefore, he took the opportunity to attract these powerful and well-connected Immortal Realm factions to serve as free labor for him.
 This method of getting something for nothing was really in line with his style.
     

 For some reason, Ji Tianchang and Yu Feng found this scene familiar.
 “Immortal Venerable, w-what do you mean by this?” Gongshu Dijie was dumbfounded. Were the tricks of the mortals in the lower realm so deep?
 Am I getting robbed instead of robbing?!  Furthermore, Gongshu Dijie was panicking. He knew that if the family head heard this news, he would definitely be furious and might even think that they were incompetent.
 He might become an abandoned son of the family and die here.
 “Shut up!” Li Yu’s order was repeated, and Gongshu Dijie was instantly silenced by an invisible force.
 “Did you hear what I said?” Li Yu looked at the Gongshu family’s punching bag and asked.
 “Remember, let our family use the Sons of Destiny to exchange for them. Don’t worry, Immortal Venerable. I’ll definitely report your words to our family master!” The punching bag suppressed his laughter, feeling like he was about to laugh out loud in the next second.
 “Okay, you may leave!” Li Yu said.
 The punching bag rushed out of the hall in high spirits and disappeared into the sky in the blink of an eye.
 Li Yu looked at the trembling Gongshu Yujie and the others with ugly expressions. “Don’t just stand there. Come with me!”
 Gongshu Dijie wanted to cry but had no tears. He was a Golden Immortal. He thought that he could dominate the lower realm and enjoy the benefits of power and status.
 In the end, he had not even enjoyed himself for three minutes before he became a prisoner who could not even keep his life.
 I have to think of a way to escape. I can’t just wait for death here!  He was well aware that the family head would never use the Sons of Destiny to exchange for them.
 The best outcome would probably be to send a Pseudo-Saint to save them.
 However, Li Yu’s strength might only be possible if the family head and the top few in the family came personally.
 Would the family head descend to the mortal world for a group of nobodies like them? Obviously not.
 Therefore, there was a high chance that they would be destroyed by Li Yu.
 Gongshu Dijie and the others were brought back to the Nine-tailed Mountain by Li Yu, but he did not bring them into the sect. Instead, he brought them to the mountain gate.
 After all, he did not want these people to know how extraordinary his sect was.
  “All of you can just stand here without moving!” Li Yu’s words were law.
 Their bodies instantly stiffened as if they were restrained by an invisible force and could not move at all. It was as if their bodies were no longer theirs, and even their eyeballs could not move.
 Other than his consciousness, he could not control any magic power or divine sense.
 They stood on the spot like statues.
 Ji Qinglan and Elder Nie were shocked by the changes in the few of them, but they knew that Li Yu had probably obtained another unbelievable reward from the Heavenly Dao.
 After all, they naturally sensed Li Yu’s extraordinary change.
 Li Yu nodded in satisfaction when he saw Gongshu Dijie and the others become statues. The combination of the Heart of Heaven and Earth and the Great Dao Golden Body was really interesting.
 It would be even more fun if he could obtain the Creator’s ability at some point. With a thought, he could turn these guys into pendants or bonsai plants.
    
Chapter 236: Bloodline Rankings  Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family, Stone Plain City’s City Lord Manor.
 “Heavenly Venerable Li Huo said that if the Flower Realm is really in the Jingxing Realm, he can agree to your request!” A man bowed and said.
 Upon hearing the man’s words, a smile surfaced on the City Lord’s face.
 “Very good! I, Gongshu Shituo, have finally found the day to hold my head high!” Gongshu Shituo was in a good mood.
 Gongshu Shituo was the city lord of one of the many cities controlled by the Gongshu family.
 As a direct descendant of the Gongshu family, his status in the family was not high. Their Stone Plain City was also the most remote and weakest among many cities.
 However, he was an ambitious person who valued power and status.
  Although his strength and ambition were not compatible, he had never been willing to give up. Fortunately, he had finally found an opportunity this time.
 A chance to prove himself to his family and turn things around.
 Furthermore, being able to establish a relationship with Heavenly Venerable Li Huo this time was what made him the happiest.
 …
 In the Qingyun Sect’s spirit herb garden, a group of beautiful demons chatted while watering the spirit herbs.
 “Haha, when I looked at the sect master’s left hand yesterday, I actually comprehended a very powerful palm technique divine art. I named it Fast Hands!” A beautiful cat girl said excitedly.
 “Fast Hands, it’s not nice. You should pick something like Dragon Claw Hand, Wandering Dragon Hand, Thunderbolt Claw, or something like that!” Another little butterfly demon remarked.
 “Sister Gu Yue, I heard that you comprehended the Great Bewitching Art from the sect master’s eyes. That’s awesome!” A little fox demon said enviously.
 “It’s a pity that no matter how powerful the charm technique is, it’s useless against our sect master!” Gu Yue said with a smile.
 She was too embarrassed to say that apart from comprehending the charm technique, she had also comprehended a water-type divine power.
 “I also comprehended a divine power with devouring power from the sect master’s mouth yesterday!”
 “All of you are so powerful. I didn’t comprehend any divine power, but when I looked at the sect master’s back, I comprehended a special concept. It was as if a voice was telling me, ‘I’ll buy a few oranges…'”
 “Speaking of oranges, I remember now. Do you know? I heard that Sister Mandarin was fortunate enough to serve the sect master in the Immortal Spring that day. She actually comprehended the art of blowing from the sect master.”
 “That’s right. I heard that Sister San Hua was fortunate enough to run to the sect master’s bed to sleep that day and comprehended the uniform sleeping technique in her sleep.”
 “I’m so envious of you guys. When will I be lucky enough to approach the sect master?”
     

 “Good news, good news! The sect master is soaking in the hot spring at the back mountain!” A golden-haired cat girl suddenly ran in and shouted.
 “Really? That’s great! Sisters, hurry up!” The demons were instantly excited!
 “Look at all of you. You’re about to drool!” The blonde cat girl had a teasing smile on her face. “I’m teasing you! Hahaha, hey, Little Qing, your skirt is wet!”
 Achoo!  Li Yu sneezed.
 He actually spat out a small bug. To Li Yu’s surprise, that small bug was still alive.
 It flew away at an extremely fast speed.
 ‘This little bug is really bold to crawl into my nose to cultivate. These demons are getting more and more impudent!’
 At the moment, Li Yu was sitting with Murong Xingqiao under the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree in the courtyard.
 They chatted as they drank the Dao Comprehension Tea.
 “The various large factions of the Immortal Realm have mobilized a large number of people and wasted money searching for the Sons of Destiny. Looks like this Great Dao inscription is extremely tempting to them!” Li Yu remarked.
 He was well aware that while these Immortal Realm factions claimed to recruit talents, they were probably scheming something.
 Perhaps some factions really wanted to recruit these children of the Heavenly Dao.
 However, humans were greedy. Those so-called immortals in the Immortal Realm were nothing much.
 They were not immortals who were truly detached from worldly matters. Their hearts were like clear mirrors, clear and lofty.
 Otherwise, he could find a mountain to cultivate in and ignore the outside world. He could enjoy peace alone.
 Establishing sects, family clans, and factions. On the surface, it was a competition for the Great Dao, but it was all driven by desire.
 Therefore, greed was inevitable. And when the temptation was big enough, everyone might develop inner demons.
 “Yes. After all, it’s a Dao Fruit Dharma Body. People in the Immortal Realm have cultivated for countless years, and that’s all they pursue. However, with billions of living beings cultivating painstakingly, they might only be able to chat with a few people. In the end, they might obtain the Great Dao and the Dao Fruit Dharma Body. Now that the Heavenly Dao has sent down a shortcut, who wouldn’t be tempted?” Murong Xingqiao said calmly.
 Li Yu’s expression remained the same, but he nodded to himself.
 These words were not like Murong Xingqiao.
 His guess was right. Murong Xingqiao had indeed changed. Her understanding and state of mind were no longer the same as the previous prince.
 Although this was related to his fusion with the Great Dao inscription, Li Yu could tell that Murong Xingqiao’s gaze had changed recently. Even her aura and expression had changed.
 This feeling was similar to Ji Qinglan back then, so Li Yu vaguely felt that Murong Xingqiao should have remembered something.
     

 Of course, the reason he paid attention to these was mainly because of the system mission notification.
 Murong Xingqiao’s Mystic Bird Palace mission had already begun, and there was more information about her character.
 Therefore, Li Yu guessed that Murong Xingqiao must have awakened the memories of her previous life.
 “Do you want to return to the Immortal Realm to take a look?” Li Yu suddenly asked for no reason.
 “Hmm! Hmm?” Murong Xingqiao was stunned after answering subconsciously.
 “Sect Master, you?” Murong Xingqiao was a little surprised.
 Li Yu smiled. “I remember something. Is it convenient to talk?”
 “Indeed, nothing can escape the sect master’s eyes!” Murong Xingqiao smiled, and then she told Li Yu some of the memories she had awakened.
 Ever since she fused with the Great Dao inscription and broke through to the Immortal Spirit Realm, some blurry memories had begun to appear in her mind.
 In fact, some vague memories had appeared in dreams in the past, but they only became clearer recently.
 As Murong Xingqiao told Li Yu about the memories she had, the power of heaven and earth fluctuated again.
 The golden light of the Heavenly Dao Rankings flourished.
 “The Bloodline Rankings are about to begin!” Li Yu and Murong Xingqiao looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 Their eyes were filled with anticipation. They wanted to see who could be on the rankings, and they were also looking forward to seeing how many people from their sects could be on it.
 At the same time, in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, the golden scroll of the Heavenly Dao Rankings also flourished with golden light. Countless people from the Immortal Realm focused their gazes on the Heavenly Dao Bloodline Rankings again.
 “The Bloodline Rankings are out too!”
 “The Bloodline Rankings shouldn’t be slaughtered by that strange faction in the lower realm again, right?”
 “Yes, most physiques are bestowed by the heavens. Lucky mortals might be lucky enough to obtain special and powerful physiques, but these bloodlines on the rankings require extraordinary opportunities to obtain!”
 “These bloodlines are the rarest and most powerful, especially the Ancestral Magus Bloodline. That’s a bloodline that not many people in our Immortal Realm possess!”
 “I can look forward to it again! I want to see which extraordinary people are on the rankings!”
  “Hmm, this ranking is also a silent competition between the various large factions!”
 As countless people discussed, golden light gathered below the 50th on the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings, and a name slowly surfaced.
 Bloodline Rankings # 50:?Yingzhao1?Bloodline
 Owner: Meng Xueqi
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Silence rang out.
 Countless people in the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm widened their eyes again.
 …
    
Chapter 237: Dominating the Rankings Again  Bloodline Rankings # 50:?Yingzhao1?Bloodline
 Owner: Meng Xueqi
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Low
 Reward: 100 years of cultivation, 30% increase in bloodline purity, 100% increase in bloodline power.
 Seeing that the first person on the Bloodline Rankings was from that lower realm faction, countless people from the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm could not remain calm anymore.
 He felt that this scene was familiar. Previously, the faction from the lower realm was ranked last on the Physique Rankings, and it was the same for the Bloodline Rankings.
  They suddenly had a feeling that history was about to repeat itself.
 “Another faction from the lower realm. Are they not going to let go of the Bloodline Rankings?”
 “What kind of faction is this? Why does it feel richer than those top factions in our Immortal Realm!”
 “Could this be the legendary hidden tycoon among the commoners?”
 “Did they dominate the rankings again this time?”
 “It can’t be, right? That would be too much!”
 “Don’t panic. It might not be as bad as we think. It might only be those in the back!”
 Seeing the strange and extraordinary name “That’s Quite a Large” again, countless living beings in the myriad worlds were interested again.
 This was especially true for many creatures of the lower realm, who were filled with anticipation and excitement.
 As mortals of the lower realm, they naturally hoped to see the powers of the lower realm crush the various heavens of the Immortal Realm.
 He hoped to see Li Yu’s mortal body shock the heavens and the myriad of immortals again.
 In the Qingyun Sect, Li Yu withdrew his gaze from the rankings.
 Seeing Meng Xueqi on the rankings, he could basically confirm that as long as one fused a drop of blood essence and obtained a portion of the bloodline power, he could enter the rankings.
 However, according to the amount of blood essence fused, there would be a difference in the purity of the bloodline.
 In that case, the Bloodline Rankings would definitely be their sect’s stage again.
 “Let’s continue!” Li Yu looked at Murong Xingqiao.
 Murong Xingqiao continued to talk about the memories that appeared in her mind.
 Li Yu roughly understood what was going on. As the system had introduced Murong Xingqiao, she was the master of the Mystic Bird Palace in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 However, according to her broken memories, the Mystic Bird Palace should have been destroyed. She could not remember the exact reason.
 Furthermore, she did not have a clear understanding of what kind of power and existence the Mystic Bird Palace was.
 After all, the memories she could remember now were still fragmented.
     

 “And this Mystic Bird Jade Pendant should have always existed in the depths of my soul. I only sensed it recently.”
 With a thought, golden light bloomed between Murong Xingqiao’s brows. Immediately, a Mystic Bird Jade Pendant flew out and landed in her palm.
 It was an ancient dark red jade pendant with a Mystic Bird carved on it. There was nothing special about it.
 “In the past, I once saw this jade pendant in my dream. It seemed to be floating in a dark void that could not be grabbed no matter what! Now, I can finally control it! In my broken memories, this jade pendant should be the key to a certain place in our Mystic Bird Palace!” Murong Xingqiao added.
 Li Yu nodded slightly. It seemed that this jade pendant was the key to this mission, just like how Ye Qiu obtained the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s treasure.
 The Bloodline Rankings continued to announce the owners of the various bloodlines on it.
 The various immortal realms took turns to enter the rankings, but no one from the lower realm entered.
 Furthermore, many of them had multiple people at the same time, with the highest number having more than ten.
 However, the purity of everyone’s bloodline was different.
 “Senior Brother, why are there so many people on each bloodline ranking?” Su Mu asked in confusion.
 Ji Qinglan explained, “Bloodlines are different from physiques. A person only needs to refine and fuse a portion of the blood essence of a divine beast or an Ancestral Magus to obtain the power of their bloodline. However, the purity will be different according to the amount of blood essence fused.
 It was clear that one could enter the rankings by possessing a portion of the bloodline power. That was why there were many people who possessed a particular bloodline.
 “Of course, a person can also fuse many bloodlines at the same time, but a person can only have one physique, and it’s a complete one. If it’s not complete, it won’t be on the rankings.”
 “Oh, so the purity of that bloodline is complete means that you’ve obtained a complete bloodline?”
 “That’s right. If you can fuse with a complete soul essence, you can basically obtain the complete bloodline power!” Ji Qinglan added.
 As time passed, the Bloodline Rankings gradually reached 35th place.
 Bloodline Rankings # 35: Suan Ni Bloodline
 Owner 1: Xin Ba
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
  Bloodline Purity: Complete
 Owner # 2: Mo Ai
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Mo Family
 Bloodline Purity: Low
 Owner 3…
 “As expected, this faction from the lower realm is on the rankings again!”
 The name of That’s Quite a Large appeared on the rankings again.
 Countless people in the Immortal Realm no longer seemed surprised, but they could not help but feel emotional.
 “It actually has a complete bloodline. This means that it’s a divine beast, the Suan Ni!”
 “I really suspect that this is a primordial faction from some Immortal Realm that went to the lower realm to play the pig to eat the tiger!”
 “It’s really possible!” Countless people from the Immortal Realm kept finding support for their mentality. Otherwise, they really felt that their understanding was about to collapse.
 They could never believe that a power from the lower realm could really have such an extraordinary person.
 However, when the bloodline rankings were announced to 30th place, they suffered another violent blow to their hearts.
     

 Bloodline Ranking # 30: Chao Feng Bloodline
 Owner 1: Tang Chi
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: High
 Reward: Complete bloodline, 500 years of cultivation…
 Owner 2: Huo Xing
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Phoenix Ancient Cave
 Bloodline Purity: Low
 Reward: Bloodline Purity increases by 50%, 300 years of cultivation…
 “It’s already the third one. That lower realm faction is already the third person on the rankings!”
 “And it actually has the high-purity divine beast Chao Feng bloodline. Even the ancient royal family only has low-purity bloodlines!”
 “Look at Tang Chi’s reward. It’s a complete bloodline. This lower realm faction has a second divine beast!”
 “It’s over. I suddenly feel that this lower realm faction is about to start slaughtering the rankings again!”
 Countless people in the Immortal Realm discussed, and their hearts ached.
 These bloodlines on the rankings were divine beasts that had appeared in ancient times. Many were born from heaven and earth, and most of them were already extinct.
 It was not easy to awaken or obtain the bloodline power and blood essence.
 It was something that could only be encountered by chance. Usually, only those top ancient families and eternal factions that had existed for countless years could obtain it.
 This was also why almost everyone on the rankings came from the top factions of the Immortal Realm.
 That was, apart from That’s Quite a Large.
 Bloodline Ranking # 20: Qilin Bloodline
 Owner 1: Guo Qilin
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Complete
 Reward: Bloodline power increases by 200%, three bloodline divine arts, bloodline limit increase by 200%
 Owner 2: Fire Qilin
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family
 Bloodline Purity: Complete
  Reward: Bloodline power increases by 200%, two bloodline divine arts, bloodline limit increase by 100%
 Owner #3: Jun Wanjie
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Jun Family
 Bloodline Purity: Medium…
 “Oh heavens, another one with a complete bloodline!”
 “This is unbelievable. This lower realm faction actually possesses an ancient divine beast Qilin!”
 “Have you noticed why Guo Qilin’s reward is so much better than the Fire Qilin’s? Why is the reward so pure?”
 …
    
Chapter 238: Collapse of Common Sense  Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family.
 Seeing that Guo Qilin’s reward was clearly more generous than their Fire Qilin, everyone from the Gongshu family was unconvinced.
 They were both divine beast Qilins, so why were their rewards so different? The difference in the purity of their bloodlines was the reason for the difference in rewards.
 Why was there a difference this time?
 “Is the reward divided according to the owner’s strength?”
 “Even so, our Gongshu family’s Fire Qilin should be stronger. A divine beast Qilin from the lower realm is restricted by the laws of heaven and earth and spiritual energy. No matter what, it can’t be stronger than our Immortal Realm’s Qilin!”
 “That’s right, the difference in rewards is too great!”
  Everyone from the Gongshu family was filled with resentment.
 The Fire Qilin was standing behind Gongshu Qitian, its eyes filled with unwillingness.
 As the guardian divine beast of the Immortal Realm’s Ancient Family, he was naturally unconvinced that he had lost to the Qilin from the lower realm.
 However, even if he was dissatisfied, there was nothing he could do. After all, that was the Heavenly Dao. What could he do?
 “Are you unwilling to accept this?” Gongshu Qitian looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings expressionlessly and asked.
 “Yes!” The Fire Qilin nodded.
 He seemed to understand the unwillingness in his son’s heart when he saw the Physique Rankings.
 “I’m guessing it’s probably the difference in bloodline level. Although you’re both Qilin, there are differences in bloodline registration between divine beasts of the same type. For example, there are also different levels of azure dragons. This is like how we humans have a myriad of differences in talent despite being the same person!” Gongshu Qitian said.
 The Fire Qilin nodded slightly. In that case, he felt much better.
 “However, my Gongshu family’s Qilin must be the strongest. I’ve already sent people to search for that strange faction in the lower realm. When I find them, Guo Qilin’s bloodline will be yours!” Gongshu Qitian’s voice was indifferent, but his eyes were cold.
 He would never allow a power from the lower realm to trample on the dignity of the Gongshu family.
 In the inner hall of the Gongshu family.
 After Gongshu Jin heard the report of his subordinates who had just returned from the Jingxing Realm, his face darkened and his eyes were cold.
 “A sect in the lower realm has a saint? That’s impossible!” Gongshu Jin snapped, but he suddenly thought of that door.
 They wondered if Gongshu Dijie and the others had encountered that strange lower realm faction.
 However, even that strange lower realm faction could not have a Saint Realm expert.
 The spiritual energy and the laws of heaven and earth in the lower realm could never produce a Saint.
 Even a Perfected Immortal was already a chosen one who had seized the fortune of heaven and earth.
 Otherwise, the people of the lower realm would not have preferred to come to the bottom of the Immortal Realm and still choose to ascend there.
 “What’s that sect’s name?” Gongshu Jin asked.
     

 “It’s called the Qingyun Sect!” the man replied. He would remember this name even if he turned into ashes.
 ‘It’s not that strange faction? I must be thinking too much. This probably wasn’t done by the lower realm.’
 He knew that this child was worried that he would reprimand them for not doing their job properly and deliberately exaggerated it.
 However, the other party probably had a Heaven Immortal. Otherwise, Gongshu Dijie would not have been captured.
 However, even if it was a Heaven Immortal, it was impossible for him to be from the lower realm. Therefore, he guessed that it was most likely another immortal realm faction that was also from the lower realm to find the Sons of Destiny.
 In order to compete for the position of the chosen ones, he used despicable methods.
 “Master, they also said…” The man hesitated to speak and looked at Gongshu Jin’s expression.
 “What did you say? Stop hesitating!” Gongshu Jin said angrily.
 “They said that they wanted our family to use the Sons of Destiny to exchange for Lord Gongshu Yujie and the others. One Son of Destiny for one person!”
 “What!” Gongshu Jin slammed the table and stood up, his eyes widening in anger. “Who do they think they are? How dare they threaten my Gongshu family!”
 Upon hearing this, Gongshu Jin was even more certain that the other party was definitely a faction from an Immortal Realm pretending to be from the lower realm.
 Otherwise, how could the factions of the lower realm dare to be so presumptuous as to kidnap their Gongshu family and extort them?
 Furthermore, the ones who had the courage and strength to challenge the Gongshu family were likely some ancient families and eternal factions of the Luo Heaven Immortal Realm and the Mixed Heaven Immortal Realm.
 “Hmph, no matter who it is, you must be tired of living to blackmail my Gongshu family. You may leave first. I’ll send someone to the Jingxing Realm to settle this matter later!” Gongshu Jin said coldly.
 The dignity of the Gongshu family could not be trampled on. He did not care which family or faction the other party was from. Anyone who dared to offend their Gongshu family would only die.
 …
 The Bloodline Rankings in the sky was still updating new names.
 Bloodline Ranking # 18: White Tiger Bloodline
 Owner 1: White Emperor Heavenly Venerable
 Origin: Four Spirit Worlds
 Bloodline Purity: Complete
 Reward: Bloodline power increases by 200%, three bloodline divine arts, bloodline limit increase by 200%
 Owner 2: Mandarin
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Complete

 Owner #3: Dao Xuanzi
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Primordial Dao Immortal Sect
 Bloodline Purity: Medium
 Reward: Bloodline Purity increases by 50%, one bloodline divine art, 600 years of cultivation.
 “Another lower realm faction!” Countless people watching the rankings in the Immortal Realm were stirred up again.
     

 “This is already the fifth one, right? And this time, it’s a complete bloodline. The divine beasts, Suan Ni, Chao Feng, Qilin, and White Tiger. Is this really a faction from the lower realm?”
 “I feel like my common sense of the past five million years is about to collapse. So many divine beasts are actually in the hands of a lower realm faction.”
 “Impossible, absolutely impossible. This is definitely not a lower realm faction. The Heavenly Dao must have made a mistake!”
 “Yeah, how can a lower realm have so many powerful divine beasts!”
 Many people from the Immortal Realm could not believe this fact. They felt that their past knowledge had failed them.
 Netherworld Heaven Immortal Realm, Fallen God Palace.
 Fallen Divine Child stuck out his dark red tongue and licked his purple lips as he looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings with a drooling expression.
 “So many tempting bloodlines. That’s Quite a Large. I must find this faction. My Fallen God Palace is going to be rich this time!” Fallen Divine Child said greedily.
 …
 In the Qingyun Sect, a group of cat girls surrounded the brown-haired cat girl and cheered when they saw her name on the rankings.
 “Sister Mandarin, you’re on the rankings!”
 “Is this the bloodline the sect master gave you? Divine beast White Tiger, Sister Mandarin, you’re so awesome!”
 “Alright, alright. You guys should work hard in your cultivation too. You should contribute more to our sect and be filial to the sect master. In the future, you will also become immortal and be rewarded by the sect master!” Mandarin said with a sweet smile.
 Her temperament was already very different from the other cat girls. Her entire figure had already become that of a fairy, but her figure was still very evil.
 As soon as she finished her sentence, the Heavenly Dao reward had already descended on her body. A dazzling golden light enveloped her graceful figure.

 Upon seeing the three thousand worlds, the people from That’s Quite a Large were on the rankings again. Countless people watching the rankings could not help but open their mouths again.
 They felt as if something called common sense had collapsed in their minds!
 …
    
Chapter 239: A Lower Realm Faction Challenging the Myriad Factions  This time, everyone from the Immortal Realm was at a loss for words.
 They felt as if a large rock had been stuck in their throats.
 The stone was called ‘That’s Quite a Large’.
 Their sense of superiority as people from the Immortal Realm had stepped on a big foot. The soles were cold, hard, and painful!
 For a moment, they were like soft persimmons that had been pinched. The wild horses that had been subdued could no longer stand still.
 They were filled with frustration.
 At this moment, any language seemed pale and meaningless.
  No words could explain what they had seen.
 They had no choice but to believe that the lower realm faction that dominated the Physique Rankings was also going to rule over the Bloodline Rankings this time.
 There were already six people from their factions on the rankings, and they were basically all complete. This was a little shocking.
 They could not understand why this was the case. Even with their countless years of experience and knowledge, they could not understand what they had seen.
 No one could explain everything clearly.
 Either the Heavenly Dao Rankings were joking with them, or everything they saw was an illusion.
 However, before they could recover from the impact of the Azure Dragon Bloodline.
 The new information about the person on the rankings ruthlessly attacked their souls and sense of superiority again.

 Owner 3…
 Blast!
 At this moment, everyone from the various Immortal Realms felt like they were about to split apart.
 This was especially true for the ancient families and eternal factions. They were already so jealous that they were about to turn sour.
     

 A mere lower realm faction already had seven people with complete bloodlines on the rankings. Five of them had complete bloodlines, and one had been rewarded with a complete bloodline.
 Even the top factions of the Immortal Realm, who thought they were rich and had plenty of talent, could not catch up.
 This caused their minds to explode.
 At this moment, the entire Gongshu family, the Situ family, the Qin family, the Ye family, the Mo family, and the other ancient families were silent. The word ‘bad’ was written on everyone’s faces!
 At this moment, the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings seemed to have become a one-man show for That’s Quite a Large.
 The other owners of the rankings seemed to have become accessories and punctuation marks.
 Even someone with a noble status like the Heavenly Venerable or the Realm Master seemed to be reduced to a green leaf under the dazzling light of that absurd sect.
 Everyone’s attention was focused on That’s Quite a Large.
 They were amazed by its extraordinary wealth.
 Bloodline Ranking # 14: Responding Dragon Bloodline
 Owner 1: Ao Ying
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Dragon King Hall
 Bloodline Purity: High
 Reward: Complete bloodline, three bloodline divine arts, 1000 years of cultivation. Bloodline limit increased by 200%
 Owner 2: Little Purple
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Low
 Reward: Complete bloodline, three bloodline divine powers, 2000 years of cultivation. Bloodline limit increased by 200%
 “Gasp!”
 When they saw the name again, countless living beings were already numb to it. Countless people in the Immortal Realm seemed to be used to it.
 However, when they saw Ao Ying and Little Purple’s rewards, they instantly exploded.
 This was especially true for the Dragon King Hall. Their voices of surprise and dissatisfaction were simply about to shatter the nine heavens.
 If anyone present could collect negative emotions to cultivate, they would probably reach the maximum level in one second.
 “On what basis? The rewards for our Divine Son’s high-level bloodline are inferior to that low-level bloodline from that lower realm faction!”
 “Yeah, there is a mistake with the Heavenly Dao Rankings!”
 One had a high-grade bloodline purity, while the other had a low-grade bloodline purity. Yet, they were both rewarded with a complete bloodline.
 Furthermore, that fellow from the lower realm had more cultivation rewards than Ao Ying by a thousand years.
 This was simply making things special.
 They could not understand.
 Could it be that the Heavenly Dao Rankings’ rewards depended on one’s identity besides bloodline?
 Even so, how could the mighty Young Master of the Dragon King Hall and the current Divine Son, Ao Ying, be inferior to a person from the lower realm?
     

 At the moment, Ao Ying felt uncomfortable as if she had eaten a fly. Her heart was in turmoil.
 He had already accepted the fact that someone from that faction in the lower realm was on the rankings at the same time as him.
 Furthermore, the other party had a low-grade bloodline purity while he had a high-grade bloodline purity. This made him heave a sigh of relief.
 He was not inferior to this person from the lower realm.
 Who would have thought that something would go wrong with the reward?
 This was simply equivalent to publicly humiliating him for being inferior to a fellow with a lower realm bloodline purity. Where would his face go?
 Wouldn’t he become the laughing stock of the world in the future?
 “Damn it, why!” Ao Ying’s fists cracked, and her eyes seemed about to spit fire.
 However, everyone from the Qingyun Sect was pleasantly surprised. They were also surprised by the reward given by the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 After all, his reward was indeed abnormal.
 “Haha, is Little Purple also favored by the Heavenly Dao?”
 “It’s probably our sect master’s blessing!”
 “Mm, that must be the reason. The Heavenly Dao might think that only true divine beasts are worthy of being our sect master’s mount!”
 …
 “Master, the rewards this time are really strange. Can you tell what’s going on?” A disciple asked in confusion.
 “There’s only one reason!” The Deva Sect Master stroked his beard and said confidently, “Because Little Purple is human, and Ao Ying’s original form is a black dragon!”
 “The Heavenly Dao blesses the human race, especially those who cultivate diligently. Think about Ao Ying. He came from a noble background, and he relied on the family’s resources to obtain his current achievements. I’m afraid that the Responding Dragon bloodline was exchanged with his family’s effort, and he only enjoyed the spoils of war.
 As for Little Purple, it was a mortal being who had to cultivate painstakingly to have the chance to fight against fate and obtain the fortune of heaven and earth. It had experienced countless life and death trials to obtain the blood essence of the Winged Dragon. As the saying goes, the Heavenly Dao rewards the diligent. That was why the Heavenly Dao Rankings gave it a reward even greater than the Black Dragon Race!
 “Therefore, you must work hard in your cultivation in the future. The heavens do not disappoint those who work hard. The Heavenly Dao Rankings are the best proof!”
 “Yes, we will follow your instructions!” All the disciples of the Immortal Cult replied in unison with excited expressions.
 …
 “Next is the Ancestral Magus Bloodline. Does that mean the lower realm also has the Ancestral Magus Bloodline?”
 “It’s hard to say now. I already suspect that our Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm is the lower realm!”
 “Here it comes. It’s time to announce the owner of Ancestral Magus Fu Zi’s bloodline.”
 Golden light gathered on the Heavenly Dao Rankings, slowly condensing new information.
 Bloodline Rankings # 13: Ancestral Magus Fu Zi’s Bloodline
 Owner: Feng Xian
  Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Medium
 “Indeed, we’re probably living in a fake Immortal Realm!”
 Countless people from the Immortal Realm could only laugh at themselves bitterly.
 There were already a few bloodline owners who were from That’s Quite a Large Sect. Even their people were on the rankings for the rarer Ancestral Magus bloodline.
 Furthermore, there was only one owner this time.
 This time, it was really a one-man show. They could only look up to it.
 …
    
Chapter 240: Tragedy in the Mortal World  Chaotic Star Domain, Demon God Hall.
 The Demon Lord Ji Xingzi stood on the Demon Abyss Platform with the Demon Venerables and Demon Sons of the various Demon God Halls.
 They waited for the next bloodline owner to be announced.
 Yesterday, he had just completely fused with the Xuanming blood essence that his beloved disciple, Mo Fei, had obtained from the Primordial Battlefield.
 The next 12th place was the owner of the Xuanming Ancestral Magus Bloodline.
 This time, the names of Ji Xingzi and the Demon God Hall would definitely enter the rankings and shine.
 To the Demon God Hall, this was a moment of glory that would enter the annals of history.
  “It’s all thanks to Mo Fei that I can obtain the blood essence of the Ancestral Magus Xuanming this time!” said the Demon Lord Ji Xingzi in a low voice.
 Then, he looked at Mo Fei, one of the Demon Sons, and said, “In the future, the Demon Seeking Hall will be under your control. I will officially confer you the title of Demon Venerable Fei Qiu. Don’t disappoint me!”
 “Thank you, Your Majesty. I will not disappoint you and bring our Demon God Palace to greater heights!” Mo Fei was overjoyed and immediately knelt and kowtowed in thanks.
 The other Demon Sons were also jealous. Unfortunately, they did not have the ability to obtain the blood essence of an Ancestral Magus from the Primordial Battlefield like Mo Fei.
 He could even appease this suspicious master of his. Now that he had successfully become a hall master, his future would definitely be limitless.
 “The person on the rankings is about to be announced!” A faint smile surfaced in Ji Xingzi’s eyes.
 Everyone held their breaths and focused their attention on the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings as they began to think of the congratulatory words.
 Bloodline Ranking # 12: Ancestral Magus Xuanming Bloodline
 Owner: Jun Wuhui
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Jun Family
 Bloodline Purity: Medium
 Reward…
 Bloodline Ranking # 11: Ancestral Magus Gonggong Bloodline
 Owner 1: Mo Chen
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Mo Family
 Bloodline Purity: Medium
 Reward: Bloodline Purity increases by 50%, Cultivation increases by 1000 years, Bloodline Power increases by 200%
 Owner 2: Tian Yunzi
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Nameless Sect…
 At this point, everyone from the Demon God Hall swallowed the congratulations they were about to say. All of them had strange expressions and were silent.
 They looked at each other and then at the gloomy Demon Lord Ji Xingzi.
 Mo Fei’s face was filled with panic as he looked at the rankings in disbelief.
 “Why isn’t the Demon Lord’s name here? Impossible!” Mo Fei’s expression was ugly as he panicked.
     

 He knew that Ji Xingzi was suspicious by nature, had a bad temper, and loved face.
 He was already skeptical when he offered his blood essence previously. Furthermore, it was strange. After fusing with the blood essence, not only did his strength not improve, but he also felt uncomfortable.
 If he was not his most trusted disciple, he would probably not have survived until now.
 Now that the owner of this bloodline did not have his name, he would probably not be able to explain himself.
 Sensing the pressure of Ji Xingzi locking onto him, Mo Fei’s expression changed drastically as he knelt on the ground. “Lord, please calm down. Listen to me…”
 Blast!
 A terrifying magic power instantly swept toward Mo Fei. His expression changed drastically, and he wanted to dodge, but it was too late.
 The Demon Lord was too powerful. Now, this furious strike had directly destroyed Mo Fei’s body and soul.
 Upon seeing this, everyone knelt on the ground in fear, trembling and not daring to make a sound.
 Some Demon Sons glanced at Mo Fei’s body that had turned into ashes, and the corners of their mouths twitched as they trembled.
 As the saying went, accompanying a ruler was like accompanying a tiger. This was especially true for the hot-tempered Ji Xingzi.
 It was a pity that Mo Fei’s flattery had hit the nail on the head and cost him his life.
 …
 Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, Ancient Family—Mo Family.
 When they saw their son, Mo Chen, on the rankings, the Mo Family residence was in an uproar, even though they knew this was the truth.
 Meanwhile, Mo Chen was in the study. He held a Mystic Bird Jade Pendant in his right hand and examined it carefully with a complicated expression as if he was examining a beauty.
 If Li Yu and Murong Xingqiao were here, they would definitely recognize that this jade pendant was almost identical to Murong Xingqiao’s Mystic Bird Jade Pendant.
 “Lord Divine Son!” A figure appeared out of thin air in the study. He wore a mask and black clothes as he bowed with cupped hands.
 “You brought it back?” Mo Chen asked casually, his gaze still fixed on the jade pendant.
  Although Mo Chen’s limelight and strength could not compare to Gongshu Qitian and Qin Feng, he was still an extraordinary person.
 Furthermore, he kept a low profile and rarely interacted with the disciples of the various families and factions.
 If not for the appearance of the Sons of Heaven Rankings, almost no one would have known his true strength.
 “My lord, we’ve brought the items back. According to your instructions, we’ve killed all the mortals and living beings in the Azure Sky Sect and the surrounding 5,000 kilometers. No one survived!” the black-robed man reported.
 “Very good. You may leave!” Mo Chen said and continued to examine the Mystic Bird Jade Pendant in his hand.
 This was the jade pendant he had obtained by chance. This was the jade pendant that had appeared in his dreams countless times. There was also the person wearing this jade pendant. Her appearance could not be seen clearly, but it always tugged at his heartstrings, as if it was an unforgettable beautiful figure.
 Everything was waiting for him to slowly unravel.

 Owner #3: Heavenly Venerable Li Huo
 Origin: Li Fire Realm
 Bloodline Purity: Medium…
 When they saw the people from That’s Quite a Large on the rankings again, everyone from the various immortal realms was already expressionless, and their minds were numb.
 The Bloodline Rankings had already been dominated by this lower realm faction. It was as if the various factions of the myriad worlds were competing with this lower realm faction.
 However, they seemed to be inferior.
 If not for the Heavenly Dao Rankings, they might never have imagined that a group of high and mighty Immortals, Saints, and Heavenly Venerables would be robbed of their limelight by a group of mortals from the lower realm.
 The number of powerful physiques and bloodlines possessed by a lower realm faction was almost surpassing the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 If they had not seen it with their own eyes, they would not believe it even if their father told them.
 What was happening in front of them was definitely the most unbelievable and shocking unsolved mystery they had ever seen in their lives.
 It was even more incomprehensible than the appearance of the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 However, they could only accept what they could not understand. This was the process of living beings adapting to the world.
 Just like how humans could not understand the existence of heaven and earth and the passage of time, they could only accept this setting for the time being.

 Reward: Bloodline Purity increases by 60%, Cultivation increases by 1200 years, Bloodline Limit increases by 200%

 “R-Ruler is on the rankings!”
 When they saw Ji Xingzi’s name appear on the rankings, everyone from the Demon God Hall had complicated expressions and fell silent.
 The corners of Ji Xingzi’s mouth twitched, and his gaze was complicated as if his heart was being stabbed.
 It turned out that Mo Fei did not lie to him. He did not give him the fake blood essence that wanted to harm him, but the blood essence had the wrong name.
  He really regretted it now. No matter what, Mo Fei was the most loyal among his many disciples and the only one he could trust.
 Yet, he had killed him personally.
 ‘I… I was too impulsive.’
 ‘My beloved disciple! I’ve let you down!’
 Ji Xingzi wailed in his heart and cried with regret, but he still pretended that nothing had happened.
 He had to finish the path he had walked no matter what.
 “Men, bury Mo Fei properly. He will keep the title of Demon Venerable Fei Qiu and be added to the position of the Demon God Hall!” Ji Xingzi ordered.
 …

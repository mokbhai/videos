“I know him, but who was he talking about just now? Did I hear wrongly?” “He’s shouting for the Qinling Emperor!”  “The Qinling Emperor was at least hundreds of thousands of years ago. Why would he appear here?”  “Is this what an Emperor is like? They can fight across hundreds of thousands of years?”  “The battle between Emperors is extremely powerful. It can tear the sky apart and shatter the earth. We have to be careful.”  The people engaged in heated discussions and felt that it was very terrifying. Two Emperors who had been separated by hundreds of thousands of years could actually fight?  Immortal Plane, Central Region, the Great Zhou Dynasty, Forbidden Land.  In this place, a man with disheveled hair, with an air of calm and composure, exuded a natural grandeur that traversed the vast universe. With his unrivaled authority, he possessed the demeanor that only those who occupied the highest divine position could have.  He was the Emperor of the Great Zhou.  He was the youngest Emperor in the Immortal Plane.  After him, no one in the Immortal Plane had broken through to the Immortal Emperor Realm in the past 10,000 years.  Therefore, he was also the youngest Emperor in the Immortal Plane.  His ascension to the Immortal Emperor Realm established the supreme status of the Great Zhou Dynasty and made it one of the top powers in the Immortal  Plane.  Sensing the arrival of the Qinling Emperor, he felt a surge of excitement, wanting to see how he compared with someone from hundreds of thousands of years ago, and how great the difference was.  Or perhaps, how much he surpassed the other.  The Emperor of Great Zhou looked on with fervent eyes.  In the Outer Domain Sky, the Qinling Emperor, who was just about to leave, stopped in his tracks when he heard this. He stood on the Natural Dao  Scripture. His gaze penetrated the world and faced the Emperor of Great Zhou.  “Come to the starry sky!” The Qinling Emperor’s voice was majestic, responding to the Emperor of the Great Zhou.  The world was instantly in an uproar. The Qinling Emperor was really going to engage in an Emperor’s battle with the Emperor of the Great Zhou!  “Hahaha, good. Even so, it doesn’t matter if I lose!” The Emperor of the Great Zhou laughed loudly and was in a cheerful mood. He took a step forward and descended into the starry sky, encountering the phantom of the Qinling Emperor.  “A single virtual image makes me feel palpitations. Truly worthy of being the number one figure in the mortal world back then!” The Emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty felt genuinely shocked from the bottom of his heart.  Boom!  The Qinling Emperor remained silent. Facing the Emperor of the Great Zhou, he raised his hand and an ancient city appeared in his palm. It instantly expanded and towered into the stars. Numerous meteorites surrounded the ancient city, twinkling with starlight. This was the Qinling Emperor using immense divine power to connect the stars into one entity. In the next second, the ancient city was smashed out.  Bang!  The Emperor of Great Zhou was also formidable. A wrought iron rod appeared in his palm. This was his weapon in his early years. A rod that dominated the world. As he advanced to the Emperor Realm, it also became a Great Path Weapon with immense power..  Boom!  The Emperor of Great Zhou wielded his iron rod and smashed it down fiercely, tearing hundreds and thousands of cracks in the universe. Dazzling light exploded in all directions with the point of destruction as the center, blocking the ancient city.  The battle between the two emperors stunned everyone in the Immortal Plane.  With their individual strength, they manipulated the stars, stirred the Great Path, roared the will of heaven and earth, and wielded Great Path Weapons.  The ancient city and the iron rod collided, emitting a sharp sound.  Rumble!  In an instant, countless stars were directly annihilated, and the Milky Way was resplendent. The Emperor of the Great Zhou held his iron rod and resisted the pressure of the ancient city with a solemn expression.  The ancient city and the iron rod emitted boundless light and produced a shockingly loud sound that almost shattered the universe. However, this persistence didn’t last for a few seconds.  Thump!  The ancient city of the Qinling Emperor directly crushed the starry sky around the Emperor of the Great Zhou and sent him flying.  The ancient city remained suspended in the Chaos, fluctuating without further attacks.  The Emperor of Great Zhou looked at the cracked iron rod with a shocked expression. The Qinling Emperor from hundreds of thousands of years ago was only a phantom when he descended into this world. However, he was completely no match for him in a real fight.  “I’ve lost,” The Emperor of the Great Zhou said.  “The Path of an Emperor is filled with hardships, you still have a long way to go.” The Qinling Emperor gave pointers to the Emperor of Great Zhou.  “Thank you, Qinling Emperor!” The Emperor of Great Zhou admitted defeat. His arrogance had been extinguished. The difference was too great, and he didn’t even have the heart to be jealous. He wanted to leave the starry sky in the next second. He had already been defeated and had no face to continue staying.  However, as soon as he left, an ancient mirror immediately suppressed him.  “Chi! ”  This ancient mirror was extremely terrifying. The moment it appeared, it condensed the universe and condensed tens of thousands of Path.  The surface of this ancient mirror was warm and crystal clear. It shone with a light that pierced through the ages and shot towards the Qinling Emperor.  This light seemed to possess eternal power. As soon as it shone out, all the light in the world gathered together. A war song sounded in the starry sky, destroying all obstacles.  “It’s the Monster Emperor Mirror of the Monster Clan. The Monster Emperor is here too!” In the sky, the Taoist Dragon saw this ancient mirror and shouted out in shock.  Li Qingshan also watched without blinking. The second Emperor had descended to seek guidance from the Qinling Emperor.  The Monster Emperor remained silent and directly attacked the Qinling Emperor.  At this moment, the phantom of the Qinling Emperor shone brightly and displayed peerless divine techniques. An Immortal light surged behind him and rushed into the ancient city. It fused with the ancient city and pressed forward.  Rumble!  In an instant, chaos surged, the world shattered, and the stars collapsed as if opening up a universe where all tangible matter ceased to exist.  The intense collision caused the eternal immortal light shot out by the Monster Emperor Mirror to hit the ancient city. It was a huge impact, but it didn’t shake the ancient city at all.  Despite the Monster Emperor Mirror’s full exertion, it was still ineffective.  The ancient city suppressed everything.  The Qinling Emperor looked on calmly, unmoved.  An ancient city had crushed the contemporary Emperor. The gap between them was really huge.  Clang!  At the critical moment, another Great Path Weapon emerged from the Immortal Plane, shocking everyone. It was a giant axe that swept over with great force. It collided with the ancient city. Instantly, energy poured out like an unstoppable torrent, sweeping through the starry sky, and causing the universe to tremble.  The giant axe slashed down and joined forces with the Monster Emperor Mirror to confront the ancient city.  However, it only made the ancient city tremble for a moment before it stood there steadily.  This was a world-shattering battle. The Immortal Plane was shocked, and all the races trembled. No one had expected that this battle would involve the simultaneous use of two Great Path Weapons, shocking the world.  The two Great Path Weapons represented that there were two Immortal Emperors behind them. They had joined forces to deal with the Qinling Emperor from hundreds of thousands of years ago.  When the world saw this scene, they were shocked beyond words. They could only discuss crazily and vent their shock.  Even those who weren’t good at conversing had their faces flushed red as they discussed excitedly.  “That’s the Monster Emperor Mirror, the Great Path Weapon of the Monster Emperor. It’s indeed terrifying. A single beam of immortal light can destroy everything. ”  “The Monster Emperor has been in seclusion, dormant. I didn’t expect him to make a move now.”  “That giant axe is the Great Path Weapon of the Ancestral Sacred King of the God Race. It’s indeed terrifying.”  “Ancestral Sacred King has also awakened. Judging from the situation, it seems that he has returned to his peak. The God Race is going to rise again.” “Even if the Jade Emperor and the Ancestral Sacred King attacked together, they still couldn’t do anything to the ancient city of the Qinling Emperor.”  “Moreover, the Qinling Emperor is only a phantom, not his true body. His true body was hundreds of thousands of years ago.”  “Too terrifying. This is the number one Emperor of the past. It makes people tremble from the bottom of their hearts.  “Qinling Emperor is invincible!”  The people of the world discussed intensely, expressing their excitement.  Li Qingshan and Taoist Dragon were also shocked.  Especially Li Qingshan.  He had just experienced the oppression of a few so-called Omnipotent Experts and was helpless. He was extremely aggrieved.  Now that he had witnessed the great battle between Emperors, the invincible stance of the Qinling Emperor made Li Qingshan yearn for it from the bottom of his heart.  “A man should aspire to such heights, and he can be replaced!” Li Qingshan’s heart ignited with raging flame. He wanted to break through, to become a top-notch expert, to be invincible in the world!  The galaxy trembled, and the stars exploded. Everyone trembled. The ancient city, which was suppressed by the two Great Path Weapons, suddenly shook. A ferocious sword qi slashed out from the ancient city.  As this sword Qi was swung out, killing intent surged for a hundred thousand miles and swept across the world. The vast waves of sword energy seemed like an endless ocean.  It directly drowned the Monster Emperor Mirror and the Ancestral Sacred King’s giant axe.  Bang! Bang! Bang!  The Monster Emperor Mirror cracked open and flew into the Immortal Plane.  The Ancestral Sacred King’s giant axe directly cracked open and retreated.  The two Emperors joined forces and were defeated by the phantom of the Qinling Emperor.  The ancient city was still floating in the Chaos.  Everyone watched in shock, and their breathing quickened. They marveled at the might of the Qinling Emperor and couldn’t extricate themselves.  The phantom of the Qinling Emperor stood on the Natural Dao Scripture as if waiting for the next Emperor to make his move.  However, no Emperor made a move. T/his chapter is updat/𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.c/o/m  After seeing the Qinling Emperor effortlessly defeat the two of them, the Emperors in the Human World knew that they were no match for him, so they didn’t attack.  Only then did the Qinling Emperor slowly dissipate.  At the last moment, he looked at Li Qingshan with a very gentle gaze, as if he was asking Li Qingshan.  Li Qingshan knew that the Qinling Emperor was worried about his sister.  He nodded firmly. He would definitely help his sister.  Only then did the Qinling Emperor dissipate with relief. He returned to hundreds of thousands of years ago and continued to walk his life that had already been fixed.  Meanwhile, Li Qingshan stood in the Outer Domain Sky, looking around and letting out a long sigh.  “Jerk Dragon, the teleportation formation is destroyed. How are we going to go back?” Li Qingshan asked.  “Directly tear open space,” Jerk Dragon replied..  Li Qingshan naturally knew about tearing space. However, he was only in the Primordial Immortal Realm and was unable to tear the Outer Domain Sky, so he didn’t think of it for a moment.  But Jerk Dragon could.  His intrinsic magic treasure, the silver momentum, suddenly shook and directly split open this world. A black hole appeared and connected to the Celestial Court Academy in the Immortal Plane.  “Let’s go, I’ll take you back to the Celestial Court Academy!” Jerk Dragon said.  Li Qingshan looked at the Natural Dao Scripture floating in the air and reached out to take it. Then, he strode into the torn space and returned to the Celestial Court Academy.  The storm in the torn space was very strong. Ordinary Immortals wouldn’t dare to enter, and even a Primordial Immortal would find it difficult.  However, Li Qingshan wasn’t afraid. He went in directly, endured the baptism of the storm, and then arrived at the Celestial Court Academy.  From a battlefield to a school.  From a slaughter area to a place of learning.  For a moment, Li Qingshan relaxed.  Back at the Celestial Court Academy, the first person Li Qingshan saw was Taoist Dragon.  The old man was no longer attached to his natal magic treasure. He dragged his wizened body and walked toward Li Qingshan. He clicked his tongue in wonder. “I really didn’t expect you to have such a wonderful encounter.”  Li Qingshan glanced at him and ignored Jerk Dragon.  “How did you get to know the Qinling Emperor?” Taoist Dragon asked.  “Isn’t it spreading like wildfire outside? You should already know,” Li Qingshan said.  “It feels different to hear it from the outside and from your mouth.” Taoist Dragon shook his head.  “What the outside world says is basically the truth. After all, thousands of geniuses accompanied me and experienced that Time Reversal. If you want to know the truth, just take those introductions about me and multiply them by them. That’s basically my true state,” Li Qingshan said seriously.  “Multiplying it by ten?” Taoist Dragon looked at Li Qingshan with disdain.  “You’re even more shameless than me.”  “That’s not right. I don’t dare to compare with you. Your skin is the thickest.” Li Qingshan joked and turned to leave. He wanted to return to his small courtyard and have a good rest. Then, he would organize his gains from the Prodigy Battlefield.  “Are you cursing me?” Taoist Dragon looked at Li Qingshan angrily but didn’t stop him from leaving. He murmured, “I’ll let you rest first. I’ll come back to settle the score with you later.”  Before returning to his small courtyard, Li Qingshan rushed into the waterfall to wash away his fatigue and dust.  The cold water from the waterfall poured over his head and Li Qingshan said comfortably, “It was really dangerous this time. I almost died.”  If the Qinling Emperor hadn’t crossed hundreds of thousands of years to save him, he would have died without a doubt. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)c/o/m  That fellow, Jerk Dragon, would definitely not be able to save him. Even his intrinsic magic treasure would be damaged.  After all, there were too many opponents.  After this difficult situation, Li Qingshan deeply realized that his strength was too low.  Compared to those 300-year-old geniuses, Li Qingshan’s strength was indeed formidable, capable of suppressing them, a Primordial Immortal suppressing Ancestral Immortals.  However, Li Qingshan wasn’t enough to deal with the real experts of the Immortal Plane.  In front of those so-called Omnipotent Experts, Li Qingshan was like a puppet, easily manipulated.  Under the rumbling sound of the waterfall, Li Qingshan was submerged in water and pondered silently.  “Taoist Dragon said that those Omnipotent Experts are Inherited Immortal, which means, after breaking through to the Monarch Immortal Realm, they became Inherited Immortals!”  “The last expert from the Eagle Clan was said by Jerk Dragon to be condensing an era, extremely powerful. So after the Inherited Immortal, it should be the Era Immortal.”  “As for the realm after Era Immortal, it should be the Immortal King Realm!”  “After the Immortal King Realm, it should be the Immortal Emperor, which is the Great Emperor Realm.”  “In the Emperor Realm, there should also be disparities. Otherwise, with the  Qinling Emperor being so powerful, other Emperors would appear weak.”  “I’m only in the Primordial Immortal Realm. There’s still a huge gap between me and the Immortal Emperor Realm. In the past, I was complacent and thought that I was already very powerful by breaking through to the Primordial Immortal Realm in such a short time after coming to the Immortal Plane. However, this Prodigy Battlefield has taught me a profound lesson.”  “It’s meaningless to surpass geniuses of the same level. My goal is the entire  Immortal Plane. If I can dominate the Immortal Plane and become an Emperor, becoming an expert like the Qinling Emperor and becoming the number one in the world, that will be my greatest achievement.”  Li Qingshan, who was being washed by the cold water of the waterfall, had these thoughts flow through his mind.  He had a clear understanding of his own strength.  Among his so-called peers, Li Qingshan was like the Qinling Emperor in the Immortal Emperor Realm.  However, this was a real world. There had never been a fight between Primordial Immortals or Ancestral Immortals.  All of them were attacks that reduced one’s dimensions. When they are crushed down, one wouldn’t be able to fight back at all.  Li Qingshan knew this very well.  “I need to break through. I need more things that can activate my comprehension. Or, I need a place like the Repentance Cliff in the Human World to improve myself.” Li Qingshan carefully analyzed his current advantages.  First, the 3,000 Great Paths (currently missing one).  Second, the Trikaya Buddhist Scriptures.  Third, maxed-level comprehension skills!  Especially maxed-level comprehension skills, this was Li Qingshan’s greatest advantage. It was his magic treasure that had helped him win all the way from the Human World to the Immortal Plane.  “I want to continue breaking through quickly. I have to use my maxed-level comprehension skill!” Li Qingshan said firmly in his heart..  Upon arriving in the Immortal Plane, the stimulation of the maxed-level comprehension skill wasn’t as mundane as it had been in the Human World.  Ultimately, Li Qingshan hadn’t found a place like the Repentance Cliff in the Immortal Plane.  For Li Qingshan, the Million Stele Forest of the Repentance Cliff was a unique advantage.  If he wanted to improve himself now, he had to work hard in this area.  More activation of maxed-level comprehension skills, more self- improvement.  What he needed wasn’t to fight and kill. What he needed was to calm down, learn things, and improve himself.  Boom!  Li Qingshan rushed out of the waterfall. The water evaporated instantly, and the Immortal Energy gathered, coalescing into a white robe. His black hair was draped behind him. He came to the courtyard.  He calmed his mind, brewed tea, and watched the scenery.  Li Qingshan calmly pondered how he could further stimulate maxed-level comprehension skills.  “Previously, in order to let me enter the Prodigy Battlefield, Jerk Dragon promised me a huge profit. He said that if I made a name for myself, he would reward me.”  “In that case, I’ll go look for him and ask if there’s a place suitable for me to stimulate my maxed-level comprehension skills.”  Li Qingshan thought to himself.  Although Jerk Dragon was sometimes not very reliable, his strength was still not to be underestimated.  During the previous battle, the Inherited Immortal had said that Jerk Dragon was a capable general under the Emperor of the Celestial Court.  His true body couldn’t enter the Outer Domain Sky. He could rely on his Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are p/u/blished on no/vel(/bin(.)c/o/m  Intrinsic magic treasure and control it remotely to suppress several Inherited Immortals. If it weren’t for the fact that there were too many reinforcements later, including one that was infinitely close to the Era Immortal, Jerk Dragon would have had no problem.  If they really came to the Immortal Plane, Li Qingshan would still prefer Jerk Dragon to be stronger in the confrontation between Jerk Dragon and the expert of the Eagle Clan.  Li Qingshan had just arrived in the Immortal Plane and didn’t know many people. Among these few people, there were only two top-notch experts.  General Bai and Jerk Dragon.  General Bai was far away at the Emperor’s Pass and couldn’t help him.  The only one left was Jerk Dragon in front of him.  With this in mind, Li Qingshan finished the tea in his cup in one gulp. Suddenlv. he saw someone coming.  As he looked closely, it was Taoist Dragon.  “I was thinking about you just now, and here you are. It saved me the trouble of looking for you,” Li Qingshan said with a smile.  Taoist Dragon walked over and sat down. He reached out and took the tea Li Qingshan handed him. He said in embarrassment, “I didn’t want to disturb your rest. It’s just that this time, the commotion was too big. I had no choice but to come.”  Li Qingshan raised his eyebrows and said, “You said ‘too big.’ Are you referring to the appearance of the Qinling Emperor?”  Taoist Dragon nodded and said seriously, “Not only the Qinling Emperor but also the Emperor Scripture.”  Li Qingshan smiled and looked at the Taoist Dragon with a playful look. “Earlier, in the Outer Domain Sky, you said that you didn’t intend to interfere with the Natural Dao Scripture.”  Taoist Dragon raised his hand and said sternly, “Stop there! Don’t count me in. I came here only to convey certain people’s thoughts to you.”  Li Qingshan looked at the Taoist Dragon and said, “You mean you’re just a messenger?”  “You can understand it this way.” Taoist Dragon nodded.  “You’re already so powerful, yet you’re still willing to be someone else’s messenger. Then, can I afford to provoke the other party?” Li Qingshan frowned.  Taoist Dragon pondered for a moment and replied, “At your current level, you indeed cannot afford to provoke them.” Taoist Dragon spoke very artfully.  He said, “Now”!  He had personally witnessed Li Qingshan’s journey from being an Earthly  Immortal upon entering the Celestial Court Academy to his current state as a Primordial Immortal. He had even caused quite a stir along the way, involving the Qinling Emperor from hundreds of thousands of years ago.  Therefore, the future Li Qingshan should be able to afford to provoke them.  Li Qingshan also understood. He poured himself a cup of tea, not at all in a hurry, and looked at Taoist Dragon, saying, “It seems that there are also problems within the Celestial Court.”  Taoist Dragon smacked his lips, not knowing what to say.  “You don’t have to think about how to explain it. I can understand. A huge force like the Celestial Court, which has been passed down for millions of years, has a complicated internal structure and a bloated operating system. There are many different voices. I can understand that.” Li Qingshan wasn’t angry at all. Instead, he understood. He wouldn’t let anger cloud his judgment. He knew how to think.  Taoist Dragon Long sighed and said, “You’re right. The Celestial Court is a whole to the outside world, but internally, there are countless cliques. These cliques have always been restraining each other to ensure that the other party can’t be strong enough to suppress everyone. Power struggles are even more fervent than cultivation. This is also the reason why the Celestial Court is declining. They put all their thoughts into researching, nurturing ner forces, and vying for power and profit. These things are of no help to the Celestial Court at all.”  Li Qingshan looked at the Taoist Dragon. He clenched the cup with his fingers and spun it gently. He said, “You are very reluctant, but you still came to ask me. The person who made you do this must be very powerful. However, from the fact that they sent you to ask me instead of coming over directly and forcefully taking away the Natural Dao Scripture with the rules of the Celestial Court, it can be seen that they can’t go through the proper channels.”  “In other words, I can ignore them.” Li Qingshan smiled and carefully analyzed the situation, which surprised the Taoist Dragon.  “Aren’t you afraid that they’ll use force after diplomacy fails?” Taoist Dragon asked.  “Then aren’t they afraid that I’ll summon the Qinling Emperor again?” Li Qingshan retorted, which stumped Taoist Dragon instantly. He thought about it carefully and realized that the Celestial Court was definitely more panicked than Li Qingshan.  Upon this realization, the Taoist Dragon gave Li Qingshan a thumbs-up, showing his admiration.  He hadn’t expected Li Qingshan to analyze so many things after he came.. “You know, there is a group of people who want to get their hands on the Natural Dao Scripture, but they can’t pressure you through the Celestial Court.  So, someone came to me.”  “I once had a good friend who I met when I was young. We spent more than a hundred years together and he saved me. However, after that, our ideological differences grew, so we parted ways.”  “But he saved me. I have to return the favor.’  “So in the past eight thousand years, I helped him a total of eight times. All eight times were life-and-death situations.”  “Later on, I got tired of living in the outside world, so I came to the Celestial Court Academy and became an elderly gatekeeper.  “This time, he came to me, hoping that I could persuade you to hand over the  Natural Dao Scripture and make a contribution to the revival of the Celestial  Court.”  “I wanted to refuse, but then I thought about it and came anyway. I knew you wouldn’t agree.”  “I’ve repaid him nine times for saving my life. That’s enough.’  Taoist Dragon narrated his story.  Li Qingshan nodded and sneered. “For the future of the Celestial Court, they dare to say anything. I can’t afford to be labeled as such.”  Taoist Dragon sighed, “There are indeed significant internal problems in the current Celestial Court.’  “Since there’s such a big problem, why don’t the several Emperors take action to rectify them?” Li Qingshan asked in confusion.  “Because… The Emperors who created the Celestial Court are different from before.” Taoist Dragon hesitated for a moment and said in a low voice.  “The current bloated state of the Celestial Court is caused by the descendants of the Emperors. No one dares to manage it.”  Li Qingshan suddenly realized that this was another story of a dragon slayer becoming an evil dragon.  This was an ancient topic.  In youth, full of vigor and determination, one stares at the evil dragon, brimming with killing intent.  In middle age, gradually becoming stable, one stands on the corpse of the evil dragon, enjoying the worship of all.  In old age, the youth has sailed through a thousand sails. Upon turning around, they find themselves with an enormous dragon tail.  Very few people could see through fame and fortune, see through everything in the world. and persistently pursue their own goals.  Therefore, after Taoist Dragon said that, Li Qingshan immediately understood.  “This matter ends here. Tell them my attitude truthfully. Then, let’s discuss our own affairs.” Li Qingshan sealed the topic, looked at Taoist Dragon, and said seriously. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)c/o/m  Taoist Dragon blinked and asked, “What affairs do we have?”.  Li Qingshan smiled and said slowly, “I remember someone enticing me to the  Prodigy Battlefield, promising generous rewards for achieving a good rank.”  “Now that I’ve obtained a ranking, it should meet someone’s definition of a good rank, right?” Li Qingshan stared at Taoist Dragon.  Taoist Dragon suddenly understood. He clapped his hands and said, “You’re talking about this matter? No problem. What kind of reward do you want?”  Li Qingshan said with satisfaction, “I hope you can help me go to Boiling Water Prison and rescue a girl named Hua Yun.”  The agreement between Li Qingshan and Hua Yun was for twenty years.  Twenty years were still early, but Li Qingshan already had a way to rescue her.  If he could rescue her, he would definitely do it now. Li Qingshan wouldn’t let Hua Yun stay in Boiling Water Prison for the sake of the 20-year agreement.  Coming out a day earlier was a good thing for Hua Yun.  Seeing this, Taoist Dragon immediately agreed. “No problem. It’s a small matter. Boiling Water Prison seems to be a very small prison. I’ll arrange for someone to bring Hua Yun out later!”  Li Qingshan’s face lit up with a genuine smile. It came from the bottom of his heart. Hua Yun could finally come out.  “Also, you need to help me check if these people are among the new members of the Celestial Court.” Li Qingshan immediately told Taoist Dragon the names and information of Little Nine, Little Fox, A’wei, and Five Ghosts.  He wasn’t sure if they had entered the Immortal Plane, so he asked Taoist Dragon to check.  “It’s a small matter!” Taoist Dragon agreed immediately. To him, it was indeed a small matter.  Naturally, someone would run errands.  “However, are these people you mentioned your relatives?” Taoist Dragon asked curiously.  “Yes, they are my closest friends and relatives.” Li Qingshan nodded.  Taoist Dragon immediately paid more attention to these two matters.  “You don’t have to worry about these two small matters. What other wishes do you have?” Taoist Dragon took a sip of tea and asked.  Li Qingshan asked earnestly, “Is there any place in the Celestial Court that is quiet and filled with knowledge, such as the cemetery or the stele forest?” “Cemetery, stele forest?” Taoist Dragon frowned and thought.  He quickly filtered through a lot of information. Suddenly, he had a flash of inspiration and asked, “You want to comprehend some of the Great Path information left behind by the predecessors. right?”  Li Qingshan nodded decisively. That was what he thought.  He had the maxed-level comprehension skill, so it was extremely easy for him to comprehend it.  “In my memory, there really is such a place,” said Taoist Dragon.  Li Qingshan looked at Taoist Dragon expectantly.  “However, this place doesn’t belong to the Celestial Court. It belongs to the entire Immortal Plane. People from all forces can enter. It doesn’t fit your description of a quiet place,” said Taoist Dragon.  “Where is it?” Li Qingshan frowned and asked.  “The Starry Sky Cemetery!” said Taoist Dragon.  “What is the Starry Sky Cemetery?” Li Qingshan asked in confusion.  “In this world, when one’s cultivation reaches the realm of Inherited  Immortals, after they die, some of the remaining Dao Rhymes flow into the Starry Sky Battlefield. Some will become a tomb, some will become a wandering soul without consciousness, and some will disappear and change randomly..”  “The Starry Sky Cemetery isn’t affiliated with any force. It is open to the entire Immortal Plane, but there is a requirement that the threshold is the Ancestral Immortal Realm!”  “After breaking through to the Ancestor Immortal Realm, you can enter and see if you can comprehend some of the Dao Rhymes left behind by predecessors or discover ancient skills.”  “This should meet your requirements, right?” Taoist Dragon asked.  Li Qingshan’s eyes lit up and asked, “In the Starry Sky Cemetery, there are Dao Rhymes of Inherited Immortals, Era Immortals, and Immortal Kings? What about Immortal Emperors?”  “There should be. Someone once comprehended the Emperor Scripture inside. Although it’s incomplete, it proves that they exist.” Taoist Dragon thought for a moment and said.  “Since it’s open to the entire Immortal Plane, wouldn’t it be noisy?” Li Qingshan frowned and asked.  “That won’t happen. You have to understand that the threshold to enter the Starry Sky Cemetery is the Ancestral Immortal Realm. They are very confident in themselves, and very few of them go to the Starry Sky Cemetery.” Taoist Dragon shook his head.  “Why do very few go?” Li Qingshan didn’t understand.  “People who go to the Starry Sky Cemetery to comprehend those lingering souls and incomplete Dao Rhymes spend a lot of time and gain very little. Some people go out of curiosity, but after seeing it once, very few return. Besides, the Starry Sky Cemetery is vast. You can stay in a corner undisturbed,” Taoist Dragon explained.  Li Qingshan’s eyes lit up and he immediately decided, “That’s the one.” “But you haven’t reached the Ancestral Immortal Realm,” said Taoist Dragon.  “I’ll break through very soon!” Li Qingshan said confidently. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are p/u/blished on no/vel(/bin(.)c/o/m  “You’ve just broken through to the Primordial Immortal Realm. Is it possible to break through so quickly?” Taoist Dragon looked at Li Qingshan in shock.  “Are you even human? Why is there such a huge gap between you and others?”  “That barbarian brat who came in with you is only at the peak of the Earthly  Immortal Realm. He hasn’t even broken through to the Heavenly Immortal  Realm yet. And you’re about to break through to the Ancestral Immortal  Realm. ”  “You are really a monster!” Taoist Dragon said from the bottom of his heart. He was also shocked by Li Qingshan’s speed.  “When you have accumulated enough and comprehended enough Great Paths, you can do it too.” Li Qingshan smiled sincerely and told him the secret of his breakthrough.  Taoist Dragon couldn’t be bothered to talk to Li Qingshan. It would be nice if enlightenment could be as simple as Li Qingshan described.  “I’ll go help you deal with the first two matters. As for you, you should break through to the Ancestor Immortal Realm as soon as possible. Don’t go out for the time being,” Taoist Dragon reminded Li Qingshan.  Li Qingshan nodded. He knew that he was now a popular person and many people were keeping an eye on him.  He didn’t want to go out at all. It would be better to stay quietly in the Celestial Court Academy, comprehend the Great Path, and breakthrough to the Ancestral Immortal Realm.  “This time, you finally didn’t trick me,” Li Qingshan said with a smile as he watched Taoist Dragon’s departing figure.  He looked at the rolling white clouds, the waves of the bamboo sea, and the sunset that dyed the sky red. He yawned comfortably and waved his hand. All the tea sets and tables were put away.  Li Qingshan sat in the rocking chair, swaying gently in the night breeze. Soon, he fell asleep.  The night breeze blew the leaves off, swaying them as they landed beside Li Qingshan’s feet, spinning.  The sunset glow was like a quilt, draped over Li Qingshan’s body.  The sun set, the moon rose, the stars moved, and the black clouds covered the white clouds. Everything was passing slowly.  Li Qingshan really seemed to be asleep.  However, if one looked closely, one would find that once the fallen leaves entered Li Qingshan’s surroundings, the falling speed slowed down significantly.  This falling speed wasn’t proportional to the surroundings.  Li Qingshan comprehended the Dao in his dream. He started to comprehend it unconsciously. He seemed to be asleep, but in fact, he was actually freely roaming in the Great Path.  The Great Path began to circle around Li Qingshan.  The body that had been soaked in the Great Path Spring had already been contaminated with the aura of the Great Path and was treated as one of its own. Therefore, Li Qingshan could easily absorb and comprehend these Great Paths.  His power and his cultivation level were also pushing forward..  On the mountain peak, Li Qingshan enjoyed the night breeze and progressed contentedly.  Amidst the external turmoil caused by the appearance of the Qinling Emperor and several other emperors making their moves, and the uproar stirred by the Emperor Scripture.  Li Qingshan ignored all of this.  He remained within the Celestial Court Academy, inaccessible to outsiders. Even if they tried to coerce or entice him, they couldn’t even catch a glimpse of Li Qingshan.  He had a sense of “hiding in a small building, indifferent to the seasons.”  As long as he stayed inside, the external turmoil couldn’t disturb him.  As time passed, no matter how big the matter was, it would be accepted by the world and become ordinary.  Therefore, within the Celestial Court Academy, Li Qingshan cultivated quietly and contentedly, striving to break through to the Ancestor Immortal Realm as soon as possible, and then enter the Starry Sky Cemetery that Taoist Dragon mentioned.  Time passed. Three days passed in a flash. Li Qingshan had been comprehending the Dao for the past three days. The 3,000 Great Paths were immense, and he needed to comprehend them at all times.  During these three days, Taoist Dragon didn’t show up. He was busy with some matters.  Three days later, he came to find Li Qingshan.  On the mountain peak where the breeze was gentle, white clouds gathered like cotton candy. They scattered in the sky but also seemed to have fallen into the water. The sky was as clean as a mirror, reflecting countless light shadows on the mountain peak. It was beautiful.  During this period, Li Qingshan enjoyed the beautiful scenery leisurely. Sometimes he drank tea, and sometimes he wrote. He cultivated his temperament and washed away his previous fatigue.  He regained the tranquility and mindset he once had in the Human World, on the Repentance Cliff.  In these peaceful days, he grasped every trace of emotion and made his cultivation improve. In a corner that no one knew about, he quietly became stronger.  These days made Li Qingshan’s temperament even more indifferent, imbued with the demeanor of an immortal, and deepened his understanding of the Dao.  “Tsk, tsk, tsk. Your life is more leisurely and happy than mine,” Taoist Dragon said enviously.  Li Qingshan was dressed in a black robe with white clouds interweaving on the hem. His temperament was as calm as a breeze.  “You’re old, but you’re still strong and energetic. How can you compare to me?” Li Qingshan said calmly.  “You don’t have the passion of a young man at all.” Taoist Dragon curled his lips. He couldn’t stand Li Qingshan’s behavior.  “If you count the time I’ve spent in seclusion, I’m already close to a hundred years old. In the Human World, mortals live for a hundred years. I’m already an ancestor. It’s not normal for me to still have the passion of a youth,” Li Qingshan said clearly.  “Nonsense. I’m almost 10,000 years old, yet I’m still vigorous. Every morning when I wake up, it’s like holding up the sky.” Taoist Dragon snorted at Li  Qingshan’s words. A hundred years old was only a child in the Immortal World.  “Then you should find a girl who’s ten thousand years old and get married. It’s not good for your health to keep holding it in,” Li Qingshan calmly added a provocative remark.  “Can’t I go find a younger one?” Priest Long said indignantly.  “Then you should find a divine doctor to tighten up that sagging skin. There will be a glimmer of hope,” Li Qingshan said.  “I haven’t seen you for a few days and you’ve become so sarcastic,” Taoist Dragon gritted his teeth and said. Li Qingshan’s words made his blood pressure rise, and he was grinding his teeth.  Li Qingshan continued to gaze calmly at the sea of clouds and said, “Lies don’t hurt people. The truth is the sharpest knife!”  Taoist Dragon begged for mercy. He realized that he couldn’t win Li Qingshan in a good argument. “Let’s not talk about this. Let’s change the topic. I have the information you asked me to inquire about regarding the Boiling Water Prison and the new members of the Celestial Court.’  This revelation stirred Li Qingshan. His eyes shifted and asked curiously,  “What have you found out?”  Taoist Dragon said, “Things are a bit out of your expectation.”  Li Qingshan lowered his eyes. His heart sank, but he said calmly, “Go ahead. I can take it very well.”  “Didn’t you ask me to go to Boiling Water Prison and bring out a woman called Hua Yun?” Taoist Dragon said.  Li Qingshan nodded. It was a piece of cake for Taoist Dragon.  Taoist Dragon continued, “It’s a piece of cake for me. Three days ago, after I  left, I immediately gave an order to Boiling Water Prison. I asked them to send me Hua Yun in one piece. I asked them to be respectful.” After saying that, Taoist Dragon looked at Li Qingshan.  Li Qingshan looked at Taoist Dragon calmly and said, “Go on.”  Taoist Dragon went on, “Unexpectedly, today, I received a message from the highest administrator of Boiling Water Prison.”  “He told me that Hua Yun is no longer in Boiling Water Prison,” Taoist Dragon added.  Li Qingshan frowned slightly. He stood with his hands behind his back. His fingers touched each other slightly. He said in surprise, “Why isn’t Hua Yun in the Boiling Water Prison?”  When he was in the Human World, Hua Yun had mentioned that it would be hundreds of years before she could come out.  Moreover, Hua Yun was just an unremarkable little girl in the Boiling Water  Prison. She came from the Human World and her cultivation was not strong. She could only hide in a corner and not get into conflict with others to protect herself. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)c/o/m  Therefore, she was able to find the loophole and communicate with Li Qingshan.  Everything was fine before. How long had Li Qingshan been in the Immortal Plane? Hua Yun was no longer in Boiling Water Prison?  There must be a problem here.  Li Qingshan stared at Taoist Dragon, his gaze gradually turning stern.  He remained silent. His face was terrifyingly calm, and his gaze made Taoist Dragon’s heart tremble.  Facing Li Qingshan’s expression and gaze, he, a peerless expert of the Celestial Court, couldn’t help but lower his stance. Subconsciously, he was actually afraid of Li Qingshan..   Perhaps it was the 3,000 Great Paths that Li Qingshan held in his hands…  Perhaps it was because Taoist Dragon had personally witnessed the Qinling Emperor travel through time and descend into the future to save Li Qingshan…  Or perhaps it was because he knew that Li Qingshan’s future would definitely far surpass his, reaching an extremely terrifying level…  Although Li Qingshan was only in the Primordial Immortal Realm, Taoist Dragon didn’t feel that way at all. Instead, he felt that Li Qingshan’s aura was stronger than some Immortal Kings.  Li Qingshan’s face turned cold and he lowered his voice unconsciously, saying, “The overseer of the Boiling Water Prison told me that not long ago, you caused a huge commotion in the Prodigy Battlefield, stirring up the entire Immortal Plane. At the same time, a group of people broke into Boiling Water  Prison and released many prisoners. Among them, Hua Yun was one of them.” Upon hearing this, Li Qingshan frowned and asked, “Do you know who it was?”  “I don’t know. The person in charge only said that they were suspected to be from the God Race, but there was no evidence because that group of people was too powerful and fast. They fought until the Boiling Water Prison collapsed and the prisoners escaped.” Taoist Dragon shook his head and explained to Li Qingshan carefully.  Li Qingshan looked at Taoist Dragon and said, “Do your best to find Hua Yun for me. I need to know her whereabouts.  Taoist Dragon looked at Li Qingshan in surprise. He didn’t expect Li Qingshan to care so much about Hua Yun. He asked, “Who is this Hua Yun to you?”  “Unless there are any accidents, she’s the mother of my child!” Li Qingshan said firmly.  “Alright, I’ll go right away. I’ll use all the resources and connections I have to help you find her.” Taoist Dragon immediately became serious. At this moment, Hua Yun’s status in his heart had risen infinitely.  “By the way, do you have an image of Hua Yun? If we use Immortal energy to evolve it, we will have a concrete picture. The probability of finding her will be very high,” Taoist Dragon asked.  Li Qingshan shook his head slowly and said, “No…”  “You haven’t met the mother of your future child?” Taoist Dragon was shocked and speechless. He had no idea how Li Qingshan had fallen in love.  Li Qingshan emphasized, “What matters between us is our feelings. Do you understand feelings? I’m not a superficial person who only cares about appearance. I’m different from you.”  Taoist Dragon sighed, “Without a picture, it’ll be much more troublesome to find her.’  “It’s like finding a needle in a haystack.”  Li Qingshan coughed. He knew that it would be difficult. He said, “Hua Yun has a beautiful voice. She has a younger sister. Her name is Hua Xiangrong. She has also entered the Immortal Plane. I only know this information. I don’t know anything else.”  Taoist Dragon said reluctantly, “Well, having one more sister makes it not just finding a needle in a haystack, but finding two needles.”  Li Qingshan sighed. He hadn’t expected the Boiling Water Prison to have such a problem.  “What does Boiling Water Prison have to do with the God Race?” Li Qingshan asked.  “How would I know? Even Boiling Water Prison’s overseers are confused. They’re still investigating the cause. I’ll let you know when there’s any new progress,” said Taoist Dragon.  “Thank you,” Li Qingshan said gratefully.  “You better watch your mouth in the future, and consider yourself lucky.” Taoist Dragon waved his hand.  Li Qingshan sat there, ignoring Taoist Dragon’s words. He was still wondering where Hua Yun was.  “I have to continue cultivating. When I cultivate the Great Search Technique to an extremely high realm, I’ll be able to search for desired things instantaneously across the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. I should be able to trace Hua Yun’s traces then,” Li Qingshan resolved. He was determined to focus on his cultivation.  “The Boiling Water Prison was breached, and Hua Yun disappeared. Have there been any news about the other few people?” Li Qingshan inquired.  “No news either.” Taoist Dragon sighed and said.  “I’ve asked someone to check the people who joined the Celestial Court recently. None of them fit your description.”  When Li Qingshan heard this, he let out a long breath. He didn’t panic. This could only mean that Little Nine and the others hadn’t ascended.  Thinking about it carefully, it had only been less than a year since he ascended to the Immortal Plane.  In less than a year, many things had happened. Li Qingshan had been through many things and had become stronger.  From the defensive battle in the Emperor’s Pass to the Celestial Court Academy, then to the Prodigy Battlefield, and finally back to the Celestial Court Academy to cultivate quietly.  It was indeed impossible for Little Nine and the others to come to the Immortal Plane. They still had to wait a few more years.  However, Xia Wuji, the Heavenly Emperor, and Immortal Northstar should have entered the Immortal Plane. They were currently hiding somewhere and cultivating.  “No news is actually the best news. Sorry to trouble you,” Li Qingshan said to Priest Long.  “It’s not troublesome. I didn’t help you but don’t worry. I’ll keep an eye on these two things for you. If there’s any news, I’ll inform you immediately,” Taoist Dragon promised.  Li Qingshan nodded lightly.  “Oh right, I have something to tell you.” Taoist Dragon suddenly thought of something.  “What is it?” Li Qingshan asked.  “A friend of mine asked me to pass you a message,” said Taoist Dragon. Li Qingshan frowned. “Is it about wanting the Natural Dao Scripture again?” Last time, he had made his stance clear. Taoist Dragon’s friends were a bit annoying.  Taoist Dragon shook his head and said, “No, it’s another friend of mine.”  “Actually, we can’t be considered friends because we’re only acquaintances. We’re not very familiar with each other. I was also very surprised that he asked me to pass a message. But after thinking about it carefully, I still decided to tell you,” Taoist Dragon added. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)c/o/m  Li Qingshan frowned. “Since you’re not very familiar with this friend, then don’t bother telling me..”  His mood was very frustrated because of Hua Yun’s disappearance. He wasn’t interested in listening to some stranger’s words.  Taoist Dragon looked at Li Qingshan with a suppressed smile, “Are you sure you don’t want to listen?”  Seeing him like this, Li Qingshan’s expression turned cold, and he asked, “Who is it?”  Immediately, Taoist Dragon obediently said, “It’s General Bai, who guards the  Emperor’s Pass. He couldn’t find you, so he asked me to pass you a message.”  “Big Brother Bail” Li Qingshan was stunned. He didn’t expect that the person who asked Taoist Dragon to deliver the message was Big Brother Bai, whom he recognized as Big Brother since arriving in the Immortal Plane.  General Bai was indeed good to Li Qingshan, to the point where he didn’t expect anything in return.  Li Qingshan truly regarded him as a Big Brother. He immediately looked at  Taoist Dragon and asked, “What did Big Brother Bai ask you to convey?”  Taoist Dragon chuckled and said, “I knew you two were close. He recommended you after all. If it was someone else who asked me to deliver a message, I would have rejected him directly. But since he asked me to deliver a message, I have to think about it carefully.”  “You’re talking too much nonsense,” Li Qingshan said impatiently.  Taoist Dragon immediately continued, “Your Big Brother Bai said that you’re famous now. He’s happy for you and isn’t surprised at all. You’re a real genius. It’s only a matter of time before you become famous.”  Li Qingshan listened quietly.  “Your Big Brother Bai also said to keep your heart steady amidst all the fame and fortune, not to waver. He advised you to settle down for a while, wait for the storm to pass, and then come out again. During this time, focus on cultivating peacefully in the Celestial Court Academy and learn more knowledge,” Taoist Dragon said.  Hearing this, Li Qingshan felt warm inside. General Bai’s words were very simple, and they were all ordinary concerns. It was like a big brother who wasn’t good with words was reminding his younger brother.  “Your Big Brother Bai also said that after five years in the Celestial Court  Academy, you can go to the Emperor’s Pass to visit him,” said Taoist Dragon.  Then he concluded, “That’s it, that’s all he said.”  Li Qingshan nodded and walked to his desk. Then, he spread out the white paper and wrote. His handwriting was strong and powerful. Every stroke was sharp.  Li Qingshan wrote seriously.  He wrote words of gratitude and then reminded Big Brother Bai to take care of his health. Finally, he promised to visit him at the Emperor’s Pass in five years and have a good time over drinks.  After Li Qingshan finished writing, a breeze blew over and dried the ink. He folded the letter and handed it to Taoist Dragon, saying, “Please deliver this to Big Brother Bai.”  “There’s teleportation formations in the Celestial Court. Now the tension in the Emperor’s Pass has eased a lot. It seems that there’s no need for war. You can take the teleportation formation and go there to take a look. You even wrote a letter. It’s so old-fashioned,” Taoist Dragon mumbled, but still took the letter.  “Nothing else, right? If so, then leave. I’m going to cultivate.” Li Qingshan immediately chased Taoist Dragon away.  “Not even a cup of tea?” Taoist Dragon popped his eyes and looked at Li Qingshan. “Last time I came here, I was treated with good tea. Even though I didn’t handle things well this time, I still walked a lot. You wouldn’t refuse to give me even a cup of tea, would you?”  Seeing this, Li Qingshan immediately picked up the teapot and handed it to Taoist Dragon, saying, “Take it with you. Drink as much as you want.” In the end, Priest Long left with the teapot.  After seeing Taoist Dragon off, Li Qingshan sat down and pondered quietly.  “Boiling Water Prison has been breached, and Hua Yun has disappeared. I don’t know if she’s good or bad. I’m very worried.”  “If they say that it was done by the God Race, then it’s impossible for them to go after Hua Yun. She might have friends in the Human World and the N/nêw n0vel chap/ers are published o/n n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m  Dimensional Battlefield, but she doesn’t have any friends in the Immortal  Plane, let alone the God Race.”  “There’s a high chance that someone from the God Race was imprisoned in the Boiling Water Prison, so they broke through the Boiling Water Prison. Hua Yun took advantage of the chaos to escape.”  Li Qingshan thought silently. He preferred to think positively. Hua Yun escaped on her own. She was now in the Immortal Plane, hiding and cultivating. In the future, Li Qingshan could meet her.  Li Qingshan never entertained negative thoughts, as that would only make him anxious.  “If I go out searching now, it’ll be like looking for a needle in a haystack. I won’t be able to find her. Therefore, I have to work hard and break through to the Ancestral Immortal Realm as soon as possible. I’ll enter the Starry Sky Cemetery and activate more of my maxed-level comprehension skills. I’ll cultivate the Great Search Technique to a higher level. That way, it’ll be relatively easier to find Hua Yun.” Li Qingshan thought of the best way. He wasn’t blinded by concern. After a calm analysis, he decided on the best path.  “Little Nine and the others haven’t ascended yet. I reckon they won’t be able to ascend in the short term. So, I’m not worried about that. They’re very safe in the Human World.”  “And Big Brother Bai. He cares so much about me and doesn’t ask for anything in return. I want to treat him as my own big brother. I’ll write a letter to check up on him,” Li Qingshan pondered seriously.  General Bai couldn’t always be the one caring about him.  Sometimes, one needs to respond to the kindness of others.  “Therefore, my top priority now is to break through from the Primordial Immortal Realm and enter the Ancestral Immortal Realm. Only then can I enter the Starry Sky Cemetery.” After thinking calmly, Li Qingshan decided on the direction he should work towards.  He would continue to comprehend the Dao and continue to cultivate and improve himself.  Strengthening oneself was always the best way to deal with all storms.  Once he determined his direction, Li Qingshan wasted no time. He used his affinity with the Great Path to become a hermit, placing his feelings in the mountains and rivers. During the day, he was friends with the sun, and at night, he was company by the moon.  He danced with the breeze.  He toasted with the sunset..  He conversed with the mountains and forests.  He was intimate with the Great Paths.  Li Qingshan refrained from conversing with others, ignoring worldly affairs. His heart was focused on comprehending the Great Paths.  Or perhaps, it was the Great Path that accepted Li Qingshan.  He could comprehend it at any time. These Great Paths entered his body and were absorbed and controlled by Li Qingshan.  During this period of time, the 2,999 Great Path Dragons in his sea of consciousness expanded and became even more powerful.  Now, it should be said that they were Great Path True Dragons.  With a vigorous momentum, akin to thunder, they surged within his sea of consciousness, causing no issues whatsoever.  This also propelled Li Qingshan’s power to break through by leaps and bounds.  Just like that, three months later.  Rumble! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m  Torrential rain poured down as if the sky had torn open, and the water of the Heavenly River cascaded down.  Li Qingshan stood in the corridor of his courtyard, holding a cup of tea, steam rising, watching the rain outside as it fell with a swoosh.  Thud!  Thud!  Thud!  A drop of rain fell and hit the floor tiles. It splashed and became a rainflower. It was extremely short. In the next moment, it merged into the heavy rain and disappeared without a trace.  This rain was formed by thousands of raindrops falling together.  In the distance, the waterfall received the help of the rain and roared angrily. The pouring rain seemed to be washing away the world.  The loud sound of a waterfall falling into the water was drowned out by the thunder.  In the sky, white clouds churned, lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled. Bolts of lightning shuttled through the clouds as if lightning dragons were swimming in the sea. They were very happy.  The entire world was being washed by the rain.  The mountains were washed, and a new round of vitality flourished. All things grew, and the soil emitted a fragrant smell that permeated the air. Li Qingshan took a deep breath and felt the power of nature.  “Rainwater is a method used by the Great Path to cleanse the world,” Li Qingshan murmured.  In this rain.  Within this thunderous atmosphere.  In this sea of clouds.  On this night.  With a boom, the Great Path True Dragons in Li Qingshan’s body broke through the shackles in his sea of consciousness and opened the door to the Ancestral Immortal realm.  Boom!  At this moment, Li Qingshan’s mind opened up to a new world. The energy pouring down was even more terrifying than the violent waterfall outside with the help of the rain.  Ancestor Immortal Realm.  On this night, Li Qingshan held a teacup and silently broke through.  No one knew that he had broken through to the Ancestral Immortal Realm while holding a cup of tea and listening to the wind and rain.  Li Qingshan wasn’t surprised. After breaking through, he took a sip of hot tea and said softly, “I can go to the Starry Sky Cemetery now.”  On this rainy night, Li Qingshan reached out, and space rippled in front of him then expanded into a channel. At the end of the channel was Taoist Dragon’s residence.  His True Dragon of the Great Path of Space was extremely terrifying. The ability to open a Space Channel was something that Li Qingshan couldn’t do in the Primordial Immortal Realm. However, he could do it in the Ancestral Immortal Realm.  At this moment, on the other end of the Space Channel, Taoist Dragon looked at Li Qingshan in a daze. He asked dumbly, “It’s only been three months and you’ve already broken through to the Ancestor Immortal Realm?”  Without Li Qingshan saying anything, he could tell at a glance that Li Qingshan had broken through to the Ancestral Immortal Realm. Otherwise, Li Qingshan, who was in the Primordial Immortal Realm, would definitely not be able to create such a terrifying Space Channel.  Li Qingshan opened the Space Channel but didn’t go over. He calmly replied  Taoist Dragon, “Yes, I broke through by luck.”  The corners of Taoist Dragon’s mouth twitched. He said inwardly, “Broke through by luck?”  “I can’t open a Space Channel as quickly and accurately as you can now,” Taoist Dragon said enviously.  “You don’t specialize in the Great Path of Space like I do. Why are you competing with me?” Li Qingshan said.  “I really can’t compare to you. Comparing a human to a monster is asking for trouble.” Taoist Dragon shook his head and comforted himself. Li Qingshan asked, “Tell me, how do I get to the Starry Sky Cemetery?”  Taoist Dragon exclaimed, “You want to go now?”  Li Qingshan nodded and said, “It’s just nice to go now!”  “You use your Divine Consciousness to look up at the sky. In the vast galaxy, you should be able to sense a floating cemetery. That is the Starry Sky Cemetery. You only need to elevate your primordial spirit into the sky and you will be able to enter it. This is why the Starry Sky Cemetery requires people in the Ancestral Immortal Realm to comprehend it. Unless you are an Ancestral  Immortal, your primordial spirit cannot comprehend such a distant location,” Taoist Dragon explained to Li Qingshan.  Li Qingshan nodded after listening and said, “Alright, I understand. You can rest now.”  After saying that, Li Qingshan reached out his hand and wiped the Space  Channel away, as if it had never existed.  Li Qingshan’s control of space had improved to another level.  He closed his eyes quietly and, as Taoist Dragon had instructed, began to comprehend.  His primordial spirit continuously explored the starry sky, ascending higher and higher, searching within the radiant galaxy beyond the sky.  Gradually, Li Qingshan sensed a floating cemetery.  Like an island, Li Qingshan felt a deep sense of familiarity the moment he laid eyes on it.  The Graveyard of the Sages in the Celestial Court Academy was modeled after the Starry Sky Cemetery..

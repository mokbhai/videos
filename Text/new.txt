About the King of Soldiers who time travels to the Southern Song Dynasty, Huashan Sword I Rule: King Leng Feng, the special forces soldier, was ambushed by the enemy during a mission and ended up traveling to the end of the Southern Song Dynasty. He became a poor young man. Faced with the plans of his uncles who were seeking wealth and death, he used strategies to kill them. In this turbulent era, facing the competition for property and political power, develop your power from a manor to conquer the world. His personal strength has gone from being unable to tie a chicken to being unparalleled in martial arts, and he dominates the world in swordsmanship at Mount Huashan. The game played among many heroes and beauties, and finally became the common master of the world, and then returned to the real world forcefully, kicking off the human expedition to the stars and sea.

There were two groups of people standing outside the Leng family's house, one group of men was menacing, and the other group of women were cold-eyed. If you look closely, there is still a look of grief and indignation on the faces of these women.       On the man's side, an old man stepped out of the crowd and said, "Lady of the Leng family, now that the men of your family are cut off, Dalang's industries will be taken care of by Erlang and Sanlang!" ”
       After the old man finished speaking, a middle-aged man beside him said: "Sister-in-law, what the clan elder said is right!" Now that the eldest brother is cut off, you can't keep those properties, rather than being taken by outsiders, it is better to hand it over to our two brothers, and you can still ensure that you have something to eat in the future! ”
       "It's so high-sounding, isn't it just to see that our orphans and widows are easy to bully! Now that my son's bones are not cold, you are not afraid of retribution, and you are forced to come to the door?"       As an angry woman's voice came, Leng Feng opened his eyes slowly, he frowned and looked around, finding that this place was very unfamiliar. Lying on a wooden bed with an old wooden cabinet at the head of the bed, there was no trace of modernity in his eyes.       Everything, very quaint!       But where is this and how did you get to this place!       By Leng Feng's side, there was also a teenage girl. The little girl's eyes were red, and she seemed to have just cried. With a look on his face, he can't see the collagen that a girl of this age should have.       Seeing Leng Feng looking at her, the little girl showed a look of surprise on her face.       "The young master is alive! The young master has come back to life! With that, the little girl ran out like a gust of wind.       Leng Feng struggled to get up, but found that he didn't have any strength, it was difficult to move a finger, and only a faint sound came out of his throat.       Seeing the scene in his eyes made Leng Feng feel confused, and he clearly remembered that he was going through a special military operation. In that primeval jungle full of dangers, Leng Feng and his team members encountered an enemy ambush, and during the battle, Leng Feng was unfortunately shot in order to protect his teammates.       "What's going on?"       But this situation and this scene are contrary to memory.       What the hell is going on! Didn't you get shot? Why doesn't my body feel any pain at all?       "Young Master Feng is really alive!"       "My hard-working edge is alive!"       Under Leng Feng's puzzled gaze, the little girl from before ran back again, and at this time she was followed by a group of women. The women's eyes were red, and they looked like they had cried before.       "The master has a spirit in the sky, keep Ruo Feng'er safe and sound!" A middle-aged woman ran up to Leng Feng and grabbed Leng Feng's hand and said.       Looking at the woman's concerned expression, Leng Feng was stunned, and still asked unconsciously, "Where is this?" ”
       "Feng'er, this is home, I'm my mother!" The woman who grabbed Leng Feng's hands said.       "Home! Mother! ”
       Leng Feng was puzzled in his heart, and suddenly his head hurt, and a chaotic stream of information poured into his mind. I felt like I had been hit hard in my head, and I snorted, and my eyes rolled and I fainted again.       A large number of memory fragments filled his mind, and he didn't know how long it had taken before Leng Feng understood what was going on. It turned out that in reality, he was really sacrificed, but he did not die, but his soul was reborn.       Leng Feng's soul was reborn in another time and space, in this time and space, the original owner of this body was also called Leng Feng, a fourteen-year-old boy. This age is half less than in the previous life.       Earlier, when the boy was riding across the bridge, the horse lost control and fell into the river with him. The cold front of this world can't swim, and he was out of breath when he was fished up.
This young man Leng Feng is also sad enough, two years ago he still had a family fortune, and his father was a well-known wealthy man from far and near. However, his father, Leng Da Rich, went to the north to do business, and he was never heard from again, and according to rumors, he was killed by the Jin people.       Since then, Leng Feng's family's property in Linjiang City has been taken over by his uncles, and his orphans' children and widows have returned to live in the countryside manor.       In the memories of the original owner of this body, his father married four wives and had five children. Leng Feng's mother is the eldest wife, who has a son and a daughter, and the other three wives are all daughters.       In this patriarchal era, and Leng Feng is the eldest son, he is naturally pampered in all kinds of ways, and he has been pampered since he was a child. By the time he was 14 years old, he still didn't learn and didn't know how to do it, and he was very stubborn.       Before, the business of the Leng family was taken care of by Leng's father alone, Leng Feng's mother and aunts didn't ask about this, and Leng Feng was a young master, so he didn't know anything about it.       Now, under the auspices of the Leng family elders, on the grounds of preserving the family industry, all the shops under Leng Feng's father's name are handed over to his two brothers to take care of together, saying that they will be returned to them after Leng Feng is crowned.       At the beginning, the two brothers of the Leng family would give the Leng Feng family a little money, but later they simply said that the shop business was losing money and they would not give them a penny.       Fortunately, Leng's father had bought some land in the countryside before, but now the Leng family is in trouble, so he can only rely on these fields to survive. Over the course of three years, all but Fluttershy and Chaibo, the old butler, have been left behind.       In recent years, natural disasters have been encountered, crops have not been harvested, and various harsh taxes and miscellaneous taxes have made life difficult for the landlord's family.       Although Leng Feng has experienced the difficulties of falling in the middle of the family, even when he returned to the countryside, his mother and aunts have not suffered for him. It's just that the school environment has changed from the city to the countryside, and he is still the most beautiful boy in the private school.       Because of the love of Leng's father and his mothers, Leng Feng has no concept of money since he was a child, and it is not an exaggeration to describe it as spending money.       At that time, the children competed to throw stones, and Leng Feng threw silver directly. When he sees someone who is not pleasing to the eye, he will use money to smash people screaming and jumping, and he just laughs. Even, he asked beggars to form a group to visit the green building.       After the fall of the family road, his great achievements are still circulating in Linjiang City.       Little master, there is more to this chapter, please click on the next page to continue reading, the back is more exciting!       Leng Feng is fourteen years old this year, and according to the era in which he lives, a man can be crowned after the age of fifteen. In other words, after a period of time, Leng Feng will be able to get back his own property according to the previous agreement. In Leng Feng's mind, it won't be long before he can live the life of a freshly dressed angry horse again.       The young man is not only worried, he is talking about people like Leng Feng.       Yesterday when he entered the city, Leng Feng went to discuss the matter with the second and third uncles.       Unexpectedly, the two uncles changed their normality, not only warmly received Leng Feng, but also promised to return the store to Leng Feng.       When Leng Feng heard that the two uncles had promised to return the property, he was naturally happy. So under the warm hospitality of the two uncles, they didn't care about the uncrowned and can't drink at all, and they rode home on a thin horse in a drowsy state.       When passing by the small bridge outside the ancient road, the horse suddenly lost control, so the cold front of this world drowned.       Knowing all this, Leng Feng knew that the soldier king of his special combat team had crossed over, and he had crossed over to this broken young master who had no knowledge or skills.       Leng Feng, a young man in this world, is too wasteful, and after reading books for a few years, he has a limited understanding of the situation in the world, but he only knows that the current imperial court has lost half of the northern country. The north was occupied by the Jin people, and the imperial court set the capital of Lin'an.       Based on these poor memories, Leng Feng could deduce that this era was the Southern Song Dynasty.       "I didn't expect that I actually traveled to the Southern Song Dynasty, and the owner of this body is still such a waste material, I really didn't get a good hand at the beginning!"       Leng Feng was powerless to complain in his heart.After reading the memories of the original owner, he had already smelled a smell of conspiracy from the drowning incident, and realized that the waste material Leng Feng fell into the water too strangely.       When the two uncles saw Leng Feng before, they were all cold and cold, and yesterday's abnormal behavior was definitely greasy. According to Leng Feng's analysis, those two uncles definitely had the motive to kill themselves in order to completely occupy the Leng family's industry.       "Eat the house!"       Leng Feng thought of a legend that in some families, if the male of the family died, then no matter how much property was left, it would be occupied by the people of the same clan.       Leng Feng opened his eyes again, but this time he didn't move, just looked around calmly.       Now Leng Feng has understood his situation, and even though he is reluctant to give up on the world he lives in, he also knows that he can't go back.       The dead are long gone, and the survivors are sad! Leng Feng can think of the pain of his parents after learning of the death, once he was the pride of his parents, and then he was the sadness of his parents.       But Leng Feng can't do anything about it, fortunately, he also has a younger sister who goes to school, which can be regarded as the love of his parents for the rest of his life.       "Feng'er, Feng'er!"       After he became conscious, Leng Feng heard a group of women shouting again.       Leng Feng's lips moved, but he didn't make a sound. He didn't know how to speak, and although he understood what it was all about, he hadn't adapted to the role in this world.       "Feng'er, don't scare your mother!"       Seeing Leng Feng wake up again, the middle-aged woman who had already cried into tears said.       It's a touching scene, but there are always people who don't open their eyes to spoil the atmosphere.       "Humph! A man is dead, can you weep him alive? ”
       "Sister-in-law, let's hurry up and take care of the aftermath, let my nephew be buried in the ground!"       "Today, we are here to inform you on behalf of the family that the property in the city will be taken care of by Erlang and Saburo. The land here will be yours, and it will be enough to feed you women! ”
       Those people outside the door also rushed in, and they didn't even glance at Leng Feng lying on the bed, in their eyes, Leng Feng was already a person who had been dead for a long time.       Although these people are all members of the Leng family, they don't care about the feelings of the same clan at all, and want to take the property left by Leng's father for themselves. Among them, Leng Feng's two uncles were the leaders, and they encouraged the elders of the Leng family, and after learning that Leng Feng had drowned, they immediately forced the door.       Leng Feng now occupies this body, and he has also obtained the original memory of this body, so he has seen through all this. Seeing the ugly faces of these people, Leng Feng also saw through their sinister intentions, and naturally it was impossible for them to succeed in their plan.       Of course, with his current ability, it is obviously unrealistic to want to face these people head-on.       However, although the current Southern Song Dynasty court is decaying, the basic social system still exists. As long as he is alive, these people will not be able to blatantly occupy their family's property for the time being.       This is also the reason why Leng Feng's two uncles want to harm him, only when Leng Feng dies, the male of Leng's father's line can be considered severed, and they have a reason to occupy the property left by Leng Feng's father.       "If you want to harm me, you are destined to be disappointed, the master is not that waste!"       A wave of anger surged in Leng Feng's heart, not to mention that he was reborn as a good person, and he was still thinking of being killed by people's hearts. However, Leng Feng also understands that anger cannot solve the problem, and the first thing to settle is the bad thing in front of him.       Of course, he will not sit still, first deal with the matter in front of him, and then his counterattack."Second uncle, third uncle! Are you going to return my inheritance? At this time, Leng Feng suddenly sat up and spoke.       When he opened his mouth, everyone was immediately startled. Even the group of women around him were the same, not to mention, the Leng family who already thought he was dead.       "Ahh Ghost! ”
       In the crowd of the Leng family opposite, someone screamed in fright. The people who didn't scream also had a panicked look on their faces. After all, what these people dare to blatantly come to the door to seize the Leng family's property is that they have determined that Leng Feng is dead.       Unexpectedly, a person who had been dead for most of the day could still sit up and speak.       Yu You Leng Feng drowned, and his face was even more white and terrifying. Even though Leng Feng had been reborn, there was still not much blood on his face.       People in this era are superstitious, and what they do is wrong, and if they have ghosts in their hearts, they are naturally afraid of ghosts.       Seeing everyone's reaction, Leng Feng couldn't help but sneer: "Second uncle, third uncle, I remember that you said yesterday that you would return my father's property to me." I didn't expect you to be so trustworthy, and I couldn't wait to invite all the clan elders today, so I thanked the two uncles! ”
       Leng Feng's words stunned everyone, how could they have ever seen Leng Feng speak like this. In the past, Leng Feng, that is, an iron-headed baby, didn't know what the etiquette was, and those who didn't like it were directly hard work.       "Leng Feng, why didn't you die!" After the second uncle heard Leng Feng's words, he calmed down. Since Leng Feng can speak well, it proves that Leng Feng is not a ghost.       "Am I still alive to disappoint you?" Leng Feng stared at the second uncle and said.       "My nephew is alive, and the second uncle is naturally very happy!"       The corner of Leng Feng's second uncle twitched, and he said with a smile on his face.       At this time, he felt as if this nephew had changed, giving him a sense of incomprehension. Although Leng Feng was very sloppy before, he was completely pinched in the palm of his hand by them, but today's look at Leng Feng made him feel frightened.       "Well, the old and young masters of the Leng family are here today, take this opportunity to return all the industries in Linjiang City to me!" Leng Feng looked around again and said.       "O nephew! You may have drunk too much yesterday, and your second uncle and I didn't talk about it, or according to the previous agreement, we can rest assured that we can hand over the eldest brother's property to you after you are crowned. ”
       At this time, Leng Feng's third uncle said with a far-fetched smile.       They also understand that Leng Feng is not dead today, and the plan to directly occupy the Leng family's industry will not work. Now stabilize Leng Feng first, anyway, Leng Feng is only fifteen years old in a few months, and they have a chance to kill Leng Feng.       "San Lang's words are reasonable, let's wait until Leng Feng is crowned before talking about property!"       Seeing that Leng Feng was unharmed, the Leng family knew that today's plan had failed, and it would be bad for them to entangle it any longer, so they jumped out and ended up.       "According to the elder of the clan, my two brothers are absolutely selfless, and everything they do is to keep the inheritance left by the eldest brother. Please also be a witness to everyone present, after Leng Feng is crowned, we will return the big brother's property to him! ”
       Leng Feng's second and third uncles expressed their sincere attitude in front of everyone, and looking at their appearance, people who don't know the truth will definitely think that they are good people.       Leng Feng also knew that these two people were acting, and he didn't know what method he was trying to use to calculate himself. However, Leng Feng didn't demolish them, just quietly watched them perform.       At the same time, he also knew that these were all appearances, and now that he had just been reborn, he did not have the strength to deal with these people. The two uncles wanted to stabilize Leng Feng, but in fact, Leng Feng didn't want to stabilize them first.       Since they want to act, then accompany them to act.After the Leng family and his party left, Leng Feng was surrounded by a group of women again.       When facing everyone in the Leng family before, Leng Feng was all performing alone. In their impressions, Leng Feng is still the kind of young master who doesn't learn or know, and only knows how to eat, drink and have fun.       But today's performance has made these women refresh their understanding of Leng Feng.       Could it be that this drowning has made Leng Feng grow!       The most excited thing is that it is Leng Feng's mother, at this time her hands are constantly pinching Leng Feng's body, and she has not recovered from the surprise of Leng Feng coming back to life. As for Leng Feng's performance just now, she didn't care too much.       In the eyes of the eldest lady Leng Li, her son has always been so good.       Instead, it was the girl Fluttershy, with a pair of big flickering eyes that kept looking at Leng Feng, and she always felt that the young master was so strange today, as if he had changed as a different person.       The three aunts were also similar to Leng Feng's mother, and their hands kept checking Leng Feng's body, wanting to make sure that Leng Feng was safe and sound.       As for Leng Feng's five little sisters, although there was surprise in their eyes, they didn't dare to move forward, they just followed behind the mothers and watched them. Leng Feng learned from his memory that the original owner of this body often teased these cute little sisters, so these little girls were very afraid of him.       Leng Feng is also a person with a sister, but in reality he is a spoiled sister maniac, so he thinks that the original owner of this body is really a bastard!       However, in the face of such a battle, Leng Feng still couldn't stand it. His soul comes from the 21st century, although he is the king of special combat teams, but at this time, he really can't cope with the care of his mother and three aunts.       "I want to be quiet!"       Leng Feng dropped a sentence and staggered out of the pile of women.       "Fluttershy, who is Quiet?" Leng's mother looked at her son's back and asked with some doubts. Fluttershy is Cold Front's maid, and Fluttershy knows more about Cold Front's business outside than the ladies at home.       "Which girl is Jingjing?" The three aunts also asked.       It's a really hard question for Fluttershy, and although she knows a lot about Leng Feng outside, she really doesn't know who Jing Jing is.       Fluttershy shakes her head and says she doesn't know.       "Young Master Feng is about to be crowned, we have to let him get married as soon as possible, so that he can regain his temperament and spread the branches for the Leng family."       Looking at Leng Feng's figure running out, these women of the Leng family are ready to arrange family affairs for Leng Feng. In this era, a man can be crowned at the age of 15, and then he can marry and have children.       Before, they thought that Leng Feng had encountered an accident, but now seeing Leng Feng running like flying, they naturally turned their worries into joy, and began to worry about Leng Feng's lifelong events.       "I'll go see the young master!" Fluttershy says hello to the others and chases them out.       Leng Feng's mother pondered for a while, as if she had made up her mind, and said, "Three sisters, you don't know, the master has ordered a family affair for Feng'er before. Now that he has arrived in such a field, the master is gone, and he can only count on Feng'er's family business! ”
       Through Leng Feng's mother's words, the three aunts also knew the general outline of this marriage.       It turned out that 15 years ago, when Leng Feng was still in his mother's womb, the Southern Song Dynasty court organized an army to go on a northern expedition, but it ended in failure. The city of Linzhou, not far from the front line, poured in a large number of refugees, and Leng Feng's father took in a down-and-out scholar and his family while doing business abroad.       Three months later, the situation stabilized, and this down-and-out scholar turned out to be a lifter. Coincidentally, not long after Leng Feng was born, the lady of the scholar's family also gave birth to a girl. In order to repay Leng's father for saving his life, the two sides set up a baby kiss.       Later, this old man was assigned to be an official in other places, and now he has become the prefect of Jiankang Mansion, and his official residence is from the third grade. It can be regarded as the great history of the Southern Song Dynasty's feudal territory. Jiankang Mansion is today's Nanjing, the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty, second only to the military town of Lin'an, the national capital.The scholar who was rescued by Leng's father was named Huang Mingli, and he still had contact with the Leng family when Leng's father was alive, but in the past two or three years, there has been no contact.       Although Leng Feng's mother is a woman, she also knows that the second and third uncles of the Leng family want to steal her family's property, so they will inevitably harm Leng Feng. In this case, I can only hope that Huang Mingli can remember the old love and help them. Of course, the biggest hope is that Huang Mingli can recognize this family business.       When Leng Feng's mother told the matter, she received strong support from the three aunts, and they decided to wait for Leng Feng to participate in the academy selection before letting him rush to Jiankang Mansion with the marriage certificate to propose.       Leng Feng didn't know what his mother and others were discussing, even if he knew, he wouldn't care.       At this time, he was lying under a tree outside the backyard, looking at the sky of this world and thinking about life. According to the memory of the original owner, all the information that was sorted out was unfavorable to him.       The era I am in now belongs to the late Southern Song Dynasty, and it seems to be different from the history in my memory. Based on what he learned, it can be seen that there are many literati and celebrities who have not appeared in this history. What can coincide is the direction of each dynasty.       The other is that the social environment I am in now seems to be very safe, but it is actually very dangerous. In terms of the overall environment, the Southern Song Dynasty court was already in danger of being destroyed at any time.       The worst thing is that the two uncles of this body are always ready to kill him.       Since you are reborn in this troubled world, if you want to settle down, you must have strong capital. And for him now, he has almost nothing, and everything has to start from scratch. Lewd development is crucial for a reborn, but his time seems to be running out.       Fortunately, he has mastered the advanced knowledge of the 21st century, and he has grown from a national defense student to the captain of the special combat team, as long as he is given enough time, he can completely stir up storms in this world.       Little master, there is more to this chapter, please click on the next page to continue reading, the back is more exciting!       But that's all for later, and the problem now is how to survive the calculations of the two uncles.       At this time, Leng Feng's two uncles were also discussing how to deal with Leng Feng as he thought.       "Third child, aren't you sure that kid Leng Feng is dead?"       "My people saw him fall into the water with their own eyes, and when he caught it, he was sure he was out of gas!"       "So what's going on now?"       "Maybe it's Leng Feng's fate!"       While Leng Feng was thinking about life, the second and third uncles of the Leng family were discussing how to plot to harm him.       "Second brother, according to me, it's better to kill him directly!"       "Third child, how many times have I been with you, this is the last resort. Leng Feng must die in an accident, and we won't have a problem if we take these properties of the eldest brother. And although the eldest brother has been missing for two years, you and I know that the news of his death was deliberately spread by us, what if the eldest brother hadn't died! ”
       "Then what should I do, Leng Feng is still a few months away from being crowned, will we return the eldest brother's property to him then?"       "Also, then he has to have his life to take it!"       "Second brother, do you have anything to do again!"       "The last time I used my hands and feet on a horse, since I let him escape. So let him fall into the water again, I don't know if this good luck can avoid it? ”
       After speaking, a hideous sneer appeared on the second uncle's face.In this world, the cold front is a landlubber, and drowning is the best way to cause accidental death.       If you can't make a plan, then set up another plan. Leng Feng's two uncles recognized this and made up their minds to let Leng Feng die from drowning.       Although Leng Feng didn't know the plans of the two uncles, he knew that the two uncles would definitely not treat him in order to seize the family property
       Soft-hearted.       He still knows the truth that open guns are easy to dodge, but hidden arrows are difficult to prevent. If you want to be fearless of other people's calculations, improving your own strength is the last word. Leng Feng didn't know the force value of the current world, and he didn't know if there were legendary martial arts masters.       As a former king of soldiers, he advocates personal strength, if there are really martial arts masters in this world, then do you have the opportunity to learn from a teacher!       Of course, that's all for later. For now, the most feasible thing is to create some self-defense weapons that are not available in this era.       Of course, the most important thing is the issue of developing forces. In troubled times, only by mastering a certain amount of power can we have the capital to settle down. Otherwise, even if you have the wealth of a country that rivals the rich, you will only become someone else's fish.       If you don't want to dominate the world, you must at least be able to protect yourself.       Leng Feng also understands that although it is a bit far away to plan these things now, people must have near-term worries without long-term concerns, and these are the foundations for him to be able to live well in this world.       As he was thinking about this, a thin figure ran up to him, none other than his maid Fluttershy.       As soon as the little girl ran over, she asked Leng Feng, "Young Master, which girl are you talking about!" Why hasn't Fluttershy seen it? ”
       "Jingjing, who is Jingjing?" Leng Feng was confused by the question, the key is that he doesn't know Jing Jing either!       "Young Master, didn't you say you wanted to be quiet just now?"       "Hahaha!" Leng Feng couldn't help but laugh as he watched Fluttershy blink with a pair of big eyes, it seems that the people of this world still don't understand the stalk of my want to be quiet.       Rubbing the little girl's head, Leng Feng smiled and said, "Be quiet!" He can't see or touch, he can only think in his heart. ”
       With that, Leng Feng smiled again at Fluttershy's puzzled look. At this moment, he felt extremely relaxed, and it seemed that it was not bad to live in this world.       The next day, Leng Feng got up early in the morning. From now on, he wants to be a happy person, go to bed early and get up early to exercise well. After all, in this era of cold weapons, physical fitness is very important, and many things cannot be done without a good body.       In his previous life, he was the captain of the special combat team, and he was naturally very clear about how to exercise. And he also has a special set of body forging techniques, and the reason why Leng Feng can become the captain of the special combat team has a lot to do with the body forging techniques he has practiced since he was a child.       After running around the house twice, calculating the distance, it was about two thousand meters, and Leng Feng had a feeling that he was about to collapse. He couldn't complain about this body anymore, if it was in his previous life, this level of exercise would not even count as an appetizer.       After gasping for breath in the courtyard for a while, Leng Feng felt relieved again.       The set of training methods in the army in the previous life is not suitable for this body at present, and only the family set of body forging techniques can fundamentally change the weak state of this body.       There are nine sets of movements in the family forging technique, and the difficulty of each set increases exponentially. In the previous life, Leng Feng's physical fitness was considered the top in the Wolf Tooth Special Combat Team, but he only trained the second set of movements.It can be seen how difficult this kind of body forging technique is. However, the effect on improving physical fitness is very obvious. The Leng family all have a long life, and few diseases find them, which is also related to this set of body forging techniques.       Leng Feng made a gesture in the middle of the courtyard, his hands in the sky and then straight behind him, while his legs were also bent backwards in an upright position. This is the starting style of the first set of movements, and it is considered qualified to be qualified if it is like a full bow, and it is considered complete to grasp the foot and neck with both hands.       However, the quality of this body is too poor, and I can't do the first movement, let alone last long. But Leng Feng never lacked perseverance, and his military career in his previous life brought him an iron will.       Hang on!       Twenty minutes later, sweat soaked Leng Feng's whole body, and his vision became blurred. I can feel that this body has reached its limits. This kind of body forging technique tests perseverance, Leng Feng has the experience of the previous life, and knows that the moment he breaks through the limit, it will bring qualitative changes to the body.       Just as his body trembled more and more, and he was about to fall, an inexplicable force suddenly rose from his body.       In an instant, Leng Feng felt that his eyes became clear, and his brain was as happy as a fish swimming into the water again.       "Whew!"       Leng Feng let out a long breath of turbidity, and a refreshing feeling of Tongtai was fed back to the flesh.       This is the benefit of pushing the limits of the body, and it is obvious that I feel that my physical fitness has improved a lot, and my thinking and actions have become more agile.       "Huh!" A puzzled sound came out of Leng Feng's mouth.       This feeling is different from the first breakthrough in the previous life, and the benefits brought by the Body Forging Technique are obviously stronger than in the previous life. I don't know if it's because of this body, or if there's something special about this era. However, Leng Feng was only puzzled for a moment and did not delve into it.       "Young Master, it turns out that you are here!" Just then, Fluttershy panted and ran over.       Fluttershy knows best what her young master's virtues are. What day didn't she get up until after three o'clock in the morning, and getting up so early today had never appeared in her memory.       Looking at the little girl running over, Leng Feng couldn't help laughing. When he first arrived in this world, he was not used to the feeling of being served, and his personal little maid, although he looked a little malnourished, looked cute and stupid.       It can be seen that although the little girl looks yellow and thin, she is also a beautiful embryo. However, Leng Feng doesn't have the bad taste that a girl has cultivated, he just treats the little girl as a sister.       "The day is in the morning, how can you waste this great time!" Leng Feng laughed.       Leng Feng's words once again made the little girl feel a kind of weirdness. Because in her impression, the young master is not like this. Although the young master in the past was quite good to her, the way he smiled never made her feel like this? Heart.       "Young Master, today is the day of the academy's selection, you can't be late!"       Fluttershy remembers what she is doing and quickly suppresses the strange feeling. She knew that with Leng Feng's temperament, she wouldn't take this matter to heart at all.       Sure enough, Leng Feng really forgot about it.       Only then did he remember that Leng Feng in this world still has no fame, and he is not even a real talent. remembered that when I was a student in my last life, I was a scholar, and my identity in this life is really wasteful.The examinations of this era were different from those of other eras, and there was no such thing as a child or a talent, and the only way for a scholar to excel was to take a formal examination, or to take the academy selection test before the age of fourteen.       Leng Feng is exactly fourteen years old this year, and this is his last chance to participate in the selection. Of course, at the level of the cold front in this world, it is the bottom of the market every time.       Although Leng Feng in the previous life was a scholar, the knowledge systems of the two worlds were different, and his knowledge of this world was still obtained from the memory of the original owner. However, Leng Feng found a strange phenomenon, that is, his memory was extremely clear, and he could now clearly remember the plausible things in the memory of the original owner, or the content that had been forgotten.       In other words, his current knowledge is much higher than that of the original owner.       "Okay, isn't it just a selection spot? The young master will take it down for him today! Leng Feng smiles at Fluttershy.       Seeing Leng Feng's confident appearance, Fluttershy shakes her head, thinking that she has another illusion.       At this time, it was bright and bright, and Leng Feng didn't plan to exercise anymore, he was going to clean up, and then go to the academy after eating something. This is the first exam since he was reborn, and although the original owner of this body is a scumbag, he also wants to see what the world is like with exams.       At this time, Leng Feng's mother Leng Li and the three aunts also came over, and they saw that Leng Feng had already gotten up early and finished exercising, and their faces showed the same surprised expressions as the little girl.       "Feng'er, why did you get up so early! Look at your sweaty body, go and wipe your body to keep it from the cold! ”
       Surprise is surprise, Leng Li's most concerned about Leng Feng's body.       "Yes! Young Master Feng just fell into the water yesterday, so he has to rest more! ”
       "The tonic has been stewed, Young Master Feng's body needs to be replenished!"       Leng Feng felt this feeling of being overwhelmed by doting again, and he finally understood why Leng Feng in this world was so wasteful.       Loving a son is like a harmful child, which refers to this kind of doting. Of course, these women don't understand either, and perhaps in their opinion, this is just a way to express their feelings.       In the chattering concerns of this group of women, Leng Feng's heart inexplicably rose a little? It was as if he had seen his mother in the real world. In his mind, his mother in the real world and his mother in this world seem to be slowly overlapping.       Leng Feng didn't know if this was an illusion or if he was affected by the original owner of this body after being reborn.       He smiled and saluted his mother and three aunts, and then finished wiping his body with the help of the little girl. In the process, there is also a small episode.       "I'll do it myself, you can go out first!"       Leng Feng took the towel from the little girl's hand, and then subconsciously waved his hand to the little girl. This is normal for the 21st century Leng Feng, since he was in middle school, the personal hygiene problems are all solved by Leng Feng himself.       Let a little girl wipe herself, Leng Feng has never experienced it.       "Master, you dislike Fluttershy!"       Fluttershy didn't move at all, and she looked like she was about to cry, which left Leng Feng speechless. Even if he is the king of soldiers in the 21st century, he can't understand the brain circuits of people in this world.       In the end, Leng Feng just asks Fluttershy to wipe his back and change into a pair of dry underwear.       When eating, I found that a porcelain urn had been placed on the table, and inside it was a large tonic soup made of cordyceps and old mountain ginseng. The corners of Leng Feng's mouth couldn't help twitching, aren't you afraid of overdoing this thing you drank in the morning?       "Gollum! Grunt! ”
       In the end, Leng Feng drank the bowl of tonic soup in one go under the gaze of a group of women.       When the hot soup enters the stomach, I only feel a stream of heat spreading out from my body, and the heat rushes straight to my brain. Leng Feng secretly said in his heart: Sure enough, it is not enough to make up for it!       But at this moment, his body absorbed the heat like a sponge.       "Humph!" Leng Feng snorted lightly, and he could clearly feel that the strength of his body had increased a little.       He had also drunk this kind of tonic soup many times before, and at most he felt a little irritable and occasionally had nosebleeds. For people, his physique has not improved significantly, but this time it is different, and it can be clearly felt that his physique has become stronger.This is the benefit of body forging, which can perfectly absorb the medicinal power in the Great Tonic Soup, and there will be no deficiency and no replenishment.       "Feng'er, what's wrong with you?" Leng Feng's appearance surprised Leng Li.       "Well, this soup tastes good!" Leng Feng said with a slight smile.       "If you like it, it's fine! When I come back, my mother will stew a bowl for you. ”
       Leng Li's face showed a happy smile, she didn't expect that Leng Feng would say that this soup was delicious. In the past, Leng Feng didn't like this kind of big tonic soup, and he always disliked the strong smell of medicine.       After drinking the soup, Leng Feng rushed to the county seat in a carriage driven by Fu Bo under the gaze of all the women in the family. Fluttershy was also with him, and the little girl had already brought everything Leng Feng needed to eat, and it was inconvenient to travel in this world, so she had to prepare everything by herself.       At this time, many students in Linjiang Academy had already gathered. Two years ago, Leng Feng also studied here, and these people were all his former classmates.       "I heard that this time it was the Lord of Jiankang Mansion who came in person, so I have to behave well!"       "The imperial court is at the time of employing people, as long as you enter the eyes of the Lord of the Dao this time, you will have the opportunity to enter the Lin'an Face Saint!"       "I heard that there are a total of ten face saints this time, and the chances are still very good."       Although there is no first martial arts and no second, and the literati have been inferior to each other since ancient times, these scholars are hypocritical enough, and they are discussing the things of the world as if they are reading without going out, and they are also observing words and looking for news.       Little master, there is more to this chapter, please click on the next page to continue reading, the back is more exciting!       "Brother Wang, with your talent, there must be a place for you this time!"       "Brother Li Liao Zan, it's still slightly inferior to Brother Li!"       The two scholars of the same age as Leng Feng hugged each other, although they were not very old, their words and actions revealed a sour meaning.       If Leng Feng was here, he would find that these two guys were both guys who had been smashed with silver by him before, and the reason was because he couldn't get used to seeing these two guys sour and rotten.       "This time for the state capital selection, we all have a chance. Even if you can't enter the top ten, you still have a great chance of fame. ”
       "I waited ten years of hard work to get my chance. But I heard that Leng Feng's stubborn guy actually came to participate in the selection, isn't this disgusting? ”
       Just as everyone was touting each other, someone suddenly said.       "What, Leng Feng can also participate in this kind of selection!"       "Yes, I heard that the mountain chief and the forest master jointly protected it."       "Why is this, how can the mountain chief and the forest master be so stubborn in order to protect it?"       "It's not that Leng Feng has a good father, the mountain chief and Lin Shi both received the kindness of Leng Father back then. Now that Leng Father is no more, I heard that it was Leng Feng's mother who found the mountain chief, and used Leng Feng's father's favor back then to exchange this opportunity for Leng Feng! ”
       Someone said sourly, but there was a sense of disparagement and schadenfreude in the words.       "People like Leng Feng, I'm ashamed to be with him!"       "Yes, this is a disgrace to us!"       "When he comes, I'll give him some color."       For a while, everyone no longer discussed the selection, but became angry with Leng Feng.       Seeing the reactions of the scholars, one of them had a sneer on the corner of his mouth, and this person was the person who deliberately revealed Leng Feng's information before.At this time, Leng Feng didn't know that these former classmates were saying bad things about him behind his back, but even Leng Feng wouldn't care about these people's faces here.       Leng Feng in his previous life was the Demon King of the Mixed World in the eyes of these people, so he would not be used to these people, and if he didn't like it, he would do it directly. It is precisely because of this character that he is very unsociable in the academy.       As for this life, he didn't take this kind of selection to heart, Leng Feng knew what his specialty was. If he wants to compare with Sour Confucianism in this era, he doesn't have any advantage.       The reason why I came to participate in today's academy selection is purely to see the world and go through the motions.       There is another reason, that is, Leng Feng's mother used a lot of connections to win the place for him this time. In Leng Li's view, he didn't expect Leng Feng to grab one of the ten places, but only hoped to use this opportunity to gain a fame.       Scholars, peasants, industrialists, and merchants, the class concept of this era has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Fame is the dream of all people, and having fame in the body is equivalent to having a talisman.       For this reason, the little savings left by the Leng family have been used up this time. Leng Feng also knew this, so he wanted to come over to see if the banknote ability could be invincible in this era.       Leng Feng had already calculated in his heart that if he wanted to survive in this world, he had to do his old job, focusing on the development of force. After all, he knows that the world will soon be chaotic, and in troubled times, big fists are the last word.       Although this era emphasizes literature over military force, and the temple is also dominated by civil officials, Leng Feng knows that it is precisely because of the emphasis on literature and light on military force that the Song Dynasty will be defeated repeatedly.       Lengjia Villa is located on the outskirts of Linjiang City, not far from Linjiang Academy. At three o'clock in the morning, Leng Feng and his party had already come to the outside of Linjiang Academy.       Under the watchful eyes of Chai Bo and Fluttershy, Leng Feng walks into Linjiang Academy. Not much has changed here from when I left two years ago, and Linjiang Academy is still the same.       "Cold Front!" Someone shouted.       When Leng Feng just walked into Linjiang Academy, he was recognized by the scholars who were talking together before.       Two years have passed, and the young man's appearance and body have undergone some changes, but everyone still recognizes Leng Feng at a glance. The main reason is that the original owner of this body was too famous before, and the scholars here have a deep memory of him.       After all, as the son of the richest man in Linjiang City, the scholars here have more or less had some stories with him before, which should be an accident to be precise.       Leng Feng swept over at a glance, and the memories of the original owner instantly flooded into his heart. He knew most of these people, and they were all former classmates of Linjiang Academy.       Everyone's eyes invariably looked at Leng Feng, although they already knew that Leng Feng was coming to participate in the selection, but when they really saw Leng Feng himself, they still showed a look of surprise.       After all, hearing is false, seeing is believing, they know what kind of goods Leng Feng is, and where does he get the confidence to participate in the selection on the same stage with them!       That is, after a moment, most people's eyes were retracted, and they were still talking together. However, the flash of disdain in these people's eyes could not hide it.Only a few did not withdraw their gaze, but they did not hide their contempt. These people are all people who think they are talented, and they naturally despise people like Leng Feng who come in by relying on relationships.       After seeing Leng Feng, the other two glanced at each other, their eyes flashed with inexplicable meaning, and then they said with a smile on their faces: "Leng Dashao, I haven't seen you for a long time, but I want to be a brother!" ”
       Leng Feng saw that it was these two people, and a sneer immediately appeared on the corner of his mouth.       These two people used to be Leng Feng's doglegs, and their parents were all shopkeepers in the industry under Leng Feng's name. But since it was rumored that Leng Feng's father was killed in the north, the two immediately turned into serfs and sang and took the lead in bullying Leng Feng.       In the past, Leng Feng didn't understand the reason, but now it seems that this is with the tacit approval and even support of their fathers. Seeing Leng Feng now, although the two of them greeted each other with a smile, it was obvious that the weasel was not happy to greet the chicken.       The performance of these people was fully seen by Leng Feng, and they were a vivid image of all beings in the world.       From the memory of the original owner, Leng Feng already knew the virtues of these people very clearly. Although the original Leng Feng boy was a gentleman and didn't learn anything, he was not stupid, but very smart, but he was too lazy to use his brain in most cases.       At the beginning, each of these people had taken a lot of advantage from him, even those few guys who pretended to be high-minded, and they had also teamed up to deceive him of his money.       At that time, Leng Feng had no concept of money, and in the eyes of others, he was an image of a stupid person with a lot of money. Later, Leng Feng's family fell into the middle of the road, and there were not many of these people who really fell into the trap for him, after all, everyone is a scholar, and they still have to be cheeky.       The happiest thing about bullying Leng Feng is the two guys with a smile on their faces, and sure enough, they are biting dogs who don't bark.       "Two dogs, three dogs, long time no see!" Leng Feng also said with a smile. These two people are the second and third in the family respectively, and Leng Feng has also called them this before.       At this time, Leng Feng's face immediately revealed an uninhibited appearance, and the image of a second ancestor who was alive appeared in front of everyone again.       "Ahem! Everyone is a scholar, two years have passed, how can Leng Dashao still be so vulgar! ”
       "In the past, I was young and ignorant of the world, and my brothers and I did some ridiculous things with Leng Dashao, but now I am very ashamed to think about it. In the past two years, I have been reading the books of sages and sages, so that I can understand things very well, and I will greet Leng Dashao with a smile when I think of the old feelings, but I didn't expect Leng Dashao to humiliate the two of us as before, which is really shameful! ”
       Hearing Leng Feng call the two of them two dogs and three dogs, the two scholars immediately changed their faces, putting on a look of deep understanding of righteousness and sanctimoniousness.       "Sure enough, it's a dog that can't be fed, weren't you proud of that title back then? This kind of treatment is not enjoyed by ordinary people, and this is not forgetting the old feelings! ”
       Leng Feng's words made the faces of these two guys turn green, they didn't expect Leng Fengxian's words to be so sharp. Originally, they wanted to put a trap on Leng Feng, first give Leng Feng a hand, and then trick Leng Feng into ordering something, and after making sure that Leng Feng had no oil and water to squeeze, they would humiliate him.       But I didn't expect that now Leng Feng didn't play cards according to the routine at all, so they had to change their strategy and directly suppress Leng Feng.       These two people were also instructed today, and if Leng Feng wants to make a fool of himself here, it is best to make Leng Feng unable to participate in the selection. However, at the level of these two people, they can only be a pawn at most.These two doglegs, who were Leng Feng before, now seem to have hugged their thighs again, become other people's doglegs, and start barking at their former masters.       "Leng Feng, call you a cold boy, that's lifting you, don't take yourself too seriously!"       "Little thief, who do you say is a dog! If it weren't for the day of the selection today, I would have to teach you a lesson! ”
       The two completely tore off their disguises and began to attack Leng Feng.       "Brother Du and Brother Zhang, don't be like this kind of person, that's a shame for us and other scholars!"       "What Brother Wang said is very true, people like Leng Feng can participate in the selection, which is a shame for us. When the society meets the master of the Dao, we will protest together and cancel the selection qualification of this prank! ”
       For a while, Leng Feng seemed to have aroused the anger of the public, and some people even proposed to make a statement to the Master of the Dao and cancel Leng Feng's selection qualifications.       Looking at the righteous and awe-inspiring appearance of these people, Leng Feng felt funny in his heart. To be honest, he didn't pay attention to these people at all.       And with his character, there is no need to waste words with these people, he doesn't have the habit of fighting a group of Confucians. And Leng Feng also saw that someone was deliberately targeting himself. As for what the purpose is, it is naturally self-evident that he will not have the opportunity to participate in this selection.       It's actually very simple to deal with this group of scholars, isn't there such a sentence, so that Xiucai can't be justified when he meets soldiers, as long as he beats them, he will naturally be honest. Anyway, he has the image of the original owner as a cover, and beating people is also in line with the style of the once cold and young people.       Don't look at the joy of these people dancing now, one by one standing on the moral high ground and accusing Leng Feng, but what they are most afraid of is that Leng Feng will flip the table and fight with them regardless of his image.       In the thinking and cognition of these people, the reader must be like a reader, and they can strike at the cold front in words. But to actually get them to do it, especially on a day like today, that's absolutely impossible.       The most important thing for readers in this era is the external image, and once they do it, whether they can gain the upper hand or not, the deliberately created image of Sven will collapse. And the fists and feet have no eyes, once they leave a little scar on their face, they may completely miss today's selection.       This is a pain they can't bear!       Leng Feng had already seen this clearly, and he was just trying to have fun before. As a traverser, he was just venting for the former owner of this body.       Leng Feng's previous life had several years of experience as a special combat team soldier king, whether it was the law of the jungle or performing missions in a foreign country, his experience was quite rich. These scholars, who only read the books of sages with their eyes and don't know what is going on in the world with their ears, want to fight him, but they are still too tender.       When Li Fu and Zhang Lu were still pointing fingers in front of Leng Feng, Leng Feng directly slammed two punches and hit these two people in the face.       Sure enough, it was immediate, and the two punches immediately calmed the scene, and all the scholars were stunned. Someone swallowed the words that were about to come out of his mouth, and there were only two wails at the scene.       "Cool!"       Leng Shuang waved his fist and said with a smug face.The image of a gentleman is vividly expressed by him. In fact, all of this was deliberately done by Leng Feng, and he knew that there were shadows of those two uncles behind everything today. This kind of performance is in line with Leng Dashao's consistent style, and it also leaves an illusion for the two uncles.       For this group of scholars, Leng Feng's performance still scared them.       Although Leng Feng also had a fight with these scholars before, at that time, everyone was half a catty to eight taels, and they were also powerless, which was not very harmful, and at most they made their clothes messy.       Now Leng Feng's body has been strengthened a little, although the degree of this strengthening is minimal, but it has obviously gained the upper hand for this group of scholars.       Leng Feng made a sudden move, and coupled with the rich fighting experience in his previous life, before everyone could react, the two of them had already been knocked down by Leng Feng.       Even Du Fu and Zhang Lu didn't expect Leng Feng to suddenly make a move on them. Their memories are still stuck in two years ago, when Leng Feng liked to play tricks on people, but he rarely went straight to fight without saying a word.       It's a fight, and it depends on the two of them acting as thugs. They know Leng Feng's strength, and when they really make a move, Leng Feng can't do it for the two of them.       However, the results were always unexpected, and it was only after Leng Feng's fist hit them in the face that the two realized they were wrong. Not only did Leng Feng dare to hit them, but the force of his fist was far greater than they expected.       Just when everyone at the scene was surprised how Leng Feng dared to do something here, the scholar who took the initiative to reveal that Leng Feng was going to participate in the selection took a step forward.       This is a white-faced scholar dressed in white with a handsome face, revealing a feminine aura on his body. If it is placed in modern society, a proper piece of small fresh meat.       I saw that the corners of his mouth involuntarily outlined a sneer, all of this was what he was leading behind the scenes, and the purpose was to deliberately target Leng Feng on this occasion.       This person knew Leng Feng's character, so he deliberately arranged for Du Zhang and the two to take the initiative to approach Leng Feng, and then make provocative remarks.       With Leng Feng's violent temper, the former dog leg dared to show his teeth and claws in front of him, presumably Leng Feng would definitely not be able to withstand such a teasing. As long as Leng Feng's anger is ignited, he will definitely not choose to speak. And what he wants is this effect, as long as it is guided, so that everyone can squeeze out and suppress Leng Feng with the same hatred.       However, everyone didn't expect that it was Leng Feng who dared to hit someone. However, this was a surprise for him, and it was far better than what he had planned.       "Sure enough, it's too insulting to be so vulgar!" The white-faced scholar said coldly.       In fact, Leng Feng is not bad, but because of his handsome image, everyone automatically ignores his appearance.       However, compared with the white-robed scholar, whether it is in terms of bearing or dress, Leng Feng is not as good as this person.       This person Leng Feng also knows, his surname is Liang Mingdong, and this person has always regarded himself as a pillar. Liang Dong also has another identity, he is the maiden nephew of Leng Feng's second aunt.       The Liang family was originally a small family in Linjiang City, but this family was a family with poetry and books, and it was a declining scholarly family. At the beginning, Leng Feng's second uncle's family affair was still a dowry given by Leng Feng's father for him, and everything before and after was arranged by Leng Feng's father.       The Liang family also took a fancy to Leng Feng's father's financial resources that they married Miss Liang to the second uncle of the Leng family, who had no culture.Later, the Liang family, with the financial support of the second uncle of Leng Feng, donated a person to the eldest young master of the Liang family. However, the fame bought with money is not the same as the fame that is really obtained, although the eldest young master of the Liang family has become a lifter, he did not have a real errand at that time.       I waited like this for seven or eight years, and after checking up and down, I released a small official from a surrounding county.       However, in the past two years, due to the financial support of the second uncle of the Leng family, he has been promoted three levels in a row with a thigh, and it is said that he is already expected to be transferred to Linjiang County in the second half of the year to serve as the county leader.       This is also the plan of the second uncle of the Leng family, the reason why he dared to murder Leng Feng is also one of his reliance. And once his eldest brother is transferred to Linjiang County to take the position of county leader, then he will be more confident in acting. At that time, the property left by Leng Feng's father would be occupied by him alone, even if it was Leng Feng's third uncle, at most he could only drink some soup with him.       However, in any case, Leng Feng will not live to be crowned at the age of 15 in his plan.       Today's all of this was also instructed by Leng Feng's second uncle, he knew that Leng Feng's mother almost emptied her family in order to let Leng Feng participate in the selection, and also used the last bit of connections, in order to make Leng Feng famous.       Everyone knew that Leng Feng had no talents, so the second uncle was not worried at all that Leng Feng would be able to become one of the geniuses of the ten Face Saints. But he knew that with the funds that Leng Mu spent, he could buy Leng Feng a reputation.       Although whether Leng Feng has a reputation or not has little impact on his plan, he wants to make Leng Feng's reputation stink first, so that Leng Feng's accident will not be so noticeable.       Although Leng Feng didn't know the second uncle's calculations, he could also think that these must have nothing to do with him. After all, in this world, the only people who want to frame him the most are the second and third uncles.       The relationship between this white-faced scholar Liang Dong and his second uncle, Leng Feng knows.       "Sissy, you also want to taste the taste of Young Master Ben's fist!" Leng Feng glanced in the direction of Liang Dong and said, and at the same time waved his fist arrogantly.       Liang Dong couldn't help but twitch his face when he saw Leng Feng's movements, which made him subconsciously think of those unpleasant memories from a few years ago.       Although Liang Dong is a deep-minded person, when he encounters an unreasonable person like Leng Zhi, he is always the one who suffers in the event of a conflict.       In the past, Leng Feng looked at this Liang Dong very unpleasantly, and often found trouble with Du Zhang and the others to beat him.       Liang Dong seems to like to wear white clothes very much, often wearing a white long shirt, which does look forceful. But almost all of his clothes were splashed with ink by Leng Feng, and he even led people to block him halfway, beating him to the point that his nose was blue and his face was swollen.       Seeing Leng Feng's expression again at this time, Liang Dong naturally thought of the past in his heart. Although the anger rose in his heart, he also knew that he couldn't face Leng Feng head-on.       In Liang Dong's cognition, Leng Feng is the kind of character who doesn't hesitate, and he can't be rough with Leng Feng. Sometimes, soft knives can also kill, and they are the kind that kill without seeing blood.       However, Liang Dong's thoughts have been seen through by Leng Feng, and his plan is doomed to failure. Because Leng Feng at this time is no longer the Leng Feng he used to be, combined with the experience of his past and present lives, he knows what kind of method to use to deal with the group of talents in front of him is the most effective.       Ren Er's thousand words, I will break them with one punch!       "What Brother Liang said is very true, such a vulgar person should be expelled from the academy!"       "Such a vulgar person is not worthy of our company!"       "Yes, get him out!""Get out!"       Liang Dong's words really worked, and a group of scholars echoed their words.       However, despite the outrage, no one dared to take a step forward. It seems that the previous two punches did have a certain effect, bringing them some shadows.       It's okay for these people to let them move their mouths, but if they really want to do it, they really don't have the guts. Leng Feng also saw through this, so he didn't pay attention to the clamor of these people at all.       "A bunch of Sven lackeys!" Leng Feng pursed his lips disdainfully and said.       Sure enough, as soon as Leng Feng's words came out, he brought 100,000 critical damage points to the opponent. At this time, everyone's faces really made Leng Feng right, just like a group of Sven lackeys.       Most of these scholars are thirteen or fourteen years old, and they are no longer the kind of people who don't understand anything, so they can naturally understand what Leng Feng means when he scolds them. If you continue to shout, you will just wait for the appearance of a Sven lackey who cooperates with Leng Feng's words. If they do, they will be worse than eating flies.       Therefore, after Leng Feng's voice fell, the scene was quiet for a while.       Embarrassed, aggrieved, some people's lips are trembling, but they don't know how to speak.       "Ahh Bleeding! I'm bleeding! ”
       "I'm bleeding too!"       At this time, two panicked voices resounded throughout the audience, which alleviated everyone's embarrassment. When everyone heard the sound, they saw that the two people who had been knocked to the ground by Leng Feng before were wiping their noses with their hands, and two long blood stains flowed from their nostrils.       Seeing the appearance of the two of them, the faces of those scholars became even more ugly, so that they were not sympathizing with these two people, but couldn't help but think that if they were also hit like this, would they be as miserable as the two of them.       Sure enough, the friends of the dead path are not dead and poor, and they are universal in any situation.       People in this era pay more attention to the parents of the body, especially the readers. And it is about to participate in the selection exam, and the appearance image is also very important, once the two of them are broken by Leng Feng like Du Zhang, then today's selection may not be possible.       "Brother Du and Brother Zhang are so miserable, it is difficult to pass the selection if their image is ruined!" Someone couldn't help but sigh.       It was this sentence that stimulated Du Zhang and the others, they suddenly stopped howling, and looked at Leng Feng with red faces. If the gaze could eat people, then Leng Feng would already have no bones left after they had eaten.       "Leng Feng, what you are doing like this is ruining the future of my two brothers! Don't think about it! The two of them roared angrily, got up from the ground and rushed towards Leng Feng.       The jar is broken, and the two of them can't take care of it so much at this time, anyway, their image has been ruined, not to mention participating in the selection exam with such an embarrassed appearance, even if the ancestral grave is smoking.       Seeing Du Zhang and the others rushing towards Leng Feng, Liang Dong's little white face showed a sneer, in his opinion, Leng Feng was in a catastrophe now.       Although Du Zhang and the others are Liang Dong's pawns, they will not give up everything for Liang Dong. On a day like today, all scholars want to show something, and if they can gain fame, it will definitely be a matter of glory to their ancestors.Du Zhang and the others can attack Leng Feng, but they will not give up this selection for Leng Feng's sake.       But who would have thought that Leng Feng would attack them! Especially when the face is broken, it is even more uncomfortable than killing them. So after the two of them were frightened, their eyes were red, and their anger value skyrocketed, as if they had been turned by an eighty-year-old mother.       Even if they die, they will pull a cushion.       "Whew!" With two sounds, Du Zhang and the others collided with Leng Feng with their teeth and claws.       Then "Woohoo! Two rings rang, and the two went faster and came back faster. was kicked in the abdomen by Leng Feng alone, hunched over like a shrimp ball and wailed again.       In terms of dry fighting, the two of them together are not as good as half of Leng Feng's fingers. Leng Feng's fighting experience is so rich, that is, Leng Feng's physical fitness in this era is not good, but his rich combat experience in his previous life makes it impossible for him to beat these two people with his eyes closed.       The previous two punches on the front door were actually not very hurtful, and they were extremely insulting. Now these two kicks are on the lower abdomen, which is called real sourness, and the painful faces of both of them are distorted.       At this moment, everyone saw clearly how Leng Feng moved his feet, but although they saw it clearly, they were even more confused. Because from their point of view, it seems that Du Zhang and the two took the initiative to bump into Leng Feng's feet.       This made some people can't help but have a ridiculous thought in their hearts: Could it be that they are acting!       It's no wonder that some people have this kind of thought, after all, two years ago, Du Zhang and the others were still Leng Feng's loyal lackeys, who knows if these two people are difficult to change, and they got involved with Leng Feng again.       "Does anyone want to try it?" Leng Feng ignored these people, took two steps forward to the two Du Zhang who fell to the ground, looked around and said.       Everyone couldn't help but take two steps back, there seemed to be an invisible aura between the two sides, and everyone's movements were surprisingly consistent.       Seeing this, Leng Feng couldn't help but smile, the reactions of these scholars were indeed within his expectations. A group of guys who bully the soft and are afraid of the hard, as long as you are tough enough, then these people will not dare to argue with you, once you show your weak side, these will treat you as a soft persimmon.       "Don't come, don't come!"       Du Zhang and the others, who fell to the ground, immediately panicked when they saw Leng Feng walking towards them with a cruel smile on his face. Now they are finally scared, at this time, the pain in their lower abdomen makes them unable to straighten their waists, if Leng Feng gives them a few more blows, maybe their lives will be handed over here.       Others don't know Leng Feng, but they know what kind of virtue Leng Dashao used to be. Leng Dashao has a perverse personality, if you are good to him, he may not be good to you. If you are bad to him, he must be even worse to you.       "Huh! Two dogs, three dogs, aren't you long-lasting? Why is it still like this! ”
       "We will always bow down in front of Leng Dashao!"       "Yes, in front of Leng Dashao, we will always be the little brother!"       The two immediately confessed, and Leng Feng lost the interest in dealing with them. He stepped over them with his feet and walked towards the group of scholars in front of him.       Seeing Leng Feng's arrogant appearance, these scholars, you look at me, I don't know what to do when I look at you.       Mingzhe protects himself, and no one wants to follow in the footsteps of Du Zhang and the others at this time. The most important thing is that these scholars all think that they are high and Leng Feng is first-class, and they don't want to lower their status and fight Leng Feng.       "Brother Leng, all this is a misunderstanding, in fact, everyone still welcomes Brother Leng to study poetry and poetry with us."Seeing Leng Feng walking towards everyone step by step, feeling the increasing pressure, someone finally spoke.       "Yes! After all, Brother Leng used to be my classmate, and after two years, he and I participated in the selection on the same stage, this is fate! ”
       "What's more, today is the day of the selection, we should exchange more poems and songs, and show the spirit of my Linjiang scholars!"       At this point, these people finally changed their faces, at least on the surface, they seemed approachable.       "Finally able to speak well!" Leng Feng smiled.       Sure enough, some people just don't clean up, and only by showing thunder means can they be honest. At this point, Leng Feng's purpose has also been achieved, he is not trying to be an enemy of everyone, just to kill chickens and show monkeys.       The scholars present really had a strong relationship with Leng Feng, that is, there were two or three people, and most of the others had no contradiction with Leng Feng. Even if he was teased by Leng Feng before, it wasn't a big problem.       Besides, although Leng Feng was sloppy back then, he was willing to spend money. If you really calculate it, almost all of these scholars present have benefited from Leng Feng.       "Haha, all of you classmates are dragons and phoenixes among people, and there are furrows in your chests! I, Leng Feng, am fortunate to be able to get to know you! Leng Feng immediately seemed to have changed as if he had changed, and said with his hands clasped into fists.       This temperament has changed too quickly, and he was fierce and vicious a moment ago, but now he has become a humble gentleman. If it weren't for the fact that there were two people lying on the ground behind Leng Feng, this scene would be harmonious.       Everyone's eyes subconsciously glanced at the two people on the ground, and the corners of their eyes twitched involuntarily, and they thought: I believe in you as a ghost!       However, Leng Feng can speak well, which is exactly what they are happy to see. After all, at this critical moment, no one wants any accidents.       "Brother Leng Liao Zan! It's also a blessing for me to be able to be a classmate with Brother Leng! ”
       "Everyone is a classmate, the same people of the Great Song Dynasty, and there will be opportunities to serve the country together in the future, so we should advance and retreat together and support together!"       For a while, everyone seemed to selectively forget what had happened before, and there was a harmonious appearance. At this time, no one looked at Du Zhang and the two on the ground, even Liang Dong also showed the appearance of a humble gentleman.       Seeing that everyone seemed to have forgotten them, Du Zhang and the others instantly felt bored, and supported each other to find a place to tidy up their appearance.       "In a few days, a few of us will be crowned!"       "Yes, after being crowned, you can go out to study and make contributions to the country!"       "Brother Leng, if I'm not mistaken, you're about to be crowned!"       Everyone unconsciously talked about the crowning, and someone asked Leng Feng. At this time, everyone had an illusion, as if Leng Feng was also one of their fellow practitioners.       Who knows, this is a means for the cold front to penetrate the enemy's interior. In his previous life, as the king of special soldiers, Leng Feng was an all-round soldier, and this means were still difficult for him.       To get the other person to accept you quickly is to show that you are like-minded with the other person. However, the scholars of this era do not understand the key, they feel that the current cold front seems to have changed, and it is no longer so annoying.       "Yes, in a few days I will be crowned, and then I will take over the family business. Don't look at me now, I don't have much money, and once I take over the family property, I don't have a lot of money. I used to be young and ignorant, but I knew that I couldn't live up to my classmates. When I am crowned, I will compensate everyone. I don't have any other skills, but if you classmates need silver, I will support Leng Feng unconditionally! ”







Leng Feng took over the conversation and said, anyway, it is to draw a big cake, hit a stick and give a sweet date, and specially pick up what others like to hear, and he will not lose a hair.       "Brother Leng is really righteous, I used to say that Brother Leng is a man of temperament and worthy of deep friendship!"       "Indeed, Brother Leng is a person who values love and righteousness!"       The big cake drawn by Leng Feng really had an effect, these are all people from Linjiang County, and they naturally know how huge the Leng family's industry in Linjiang City is.       Outsiders are not clear about the plans of the second and third uncles of the Leng family, which is mainly due to the fact that the two uncles have managed their personalities very well, and many people who do not know the truth think that the second and third uncles of the Leng family are benevolent and righteous people. thought that the two of them were sincere in setting up the industry for Leng Feng, and when Leng Feng was crowned, they would return the industry to him.       Among these scholars, that is, Liang Dong knows the doorway here, but he will not say it. Even if it is Du Zhang and the others, their father may know the second and third uncles of the Leng family and the plan, but the two of them don't know the logic behind this at all.       Therefore, Leng Feng's words are still very credible among all scholars. And everyone has been with the same class for many years, although Leng Feng left here in the past two years and went to a private school to study, but Leng Feng's original inherent impression still exists in everyone's minds.       If Leng Feng has another advantage, that is, he never looks at the weight of more money. Although it has not reached the point of treating money as dung, it is absolutely unambiguous when it comes to spending money.       It is precisely because of the original cold style that the eyes of everyone present look much kinder.       After all, this era is at the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, and everyone is not rich, so if you want to get out of Linjiang County, you must have a certain amount of financial support.       The uncle of the Liang family was a good example before, although the Liang family was a scholarly family, but in recent decades, there has not been a decent scholar in the family. Only the uncle of the Liang family, with the funding of Second Uncle Leng, donated a meritorious name.       Everyone is not stupid, knowing that they can get benefits from getting along with Leng Feng, they will naturally choose what to do.       As a result, the next atmosphere was more harmonious, and the faint cold front seemed to be the focus.       This is the role of banknote ability, that is, Leng Feng himself sighed that the banknote ability of this era is no worse than the era in which he lives. Although at this time, everything in society was still inferior, and only reading was high, but in this era, there was no asset in the family, and it was impossible to read the books of sages.       After a stick of incense, Du Zhang and the two also returned.       After some tidying up, this pair of brothers and sisters are no longer as embarrassed as before. Although Leng Feng's two kicks were not light, they were injured inside, and they couldn't be seen from the outside. Only the noses of the two of them were slightly red and swollen, and those who didn't know it didn't know that they had been beaten.       This is barely acceptable for the two, as long as no one points out what they did today at the time of selection, there is no problem.       "Brother, am I dreaming!" Du Fu said to Zhang Lu.       In their eyes, the scene they saw was like this: they saw Leng Feng talking among the crowd, and many people around him greeted each other with smiling faces. Even their new master, Liang Dong, was also talking about something with Leng Feng, looking at the two of them with a spring breeze on their faces, they seemed to be old friends for many years.       This is different from the picture imagined by the two of them, when Leng Feng didn't come before, they had heard with their own ears that these scholars were disdainful of Leng Feng. Even if it was just when they were leaving, everyone was frightened by Leng Feng's behavior, at most they just stayed away from Leng Feng, and it would not be as harmonious as now.       Abnormal, there must be demons!       "Smack!""Why are you hitting me!"       "Does it hurt?"       "Isn't this nonsense, I'll beat you to see if it hurts!"       "It's good to hurt, prove it's real."       Du Fu looked at Zhang Lu with a resentful face, why don't you beat yourself.       But at this time, the two also reacted, but fortunately, these two people have an advantage, that is, they never go into it when they can't figure it out.       Obedience to the strong is their strength, and now the situation is stronger than people, and the cold front seems to be different from before. This made the minds of the two of them active again, looked at Liang Dong, and then at Leng Feng, and the two looked at each other and walked towards the crowd.       "Young Master Feng, we were too excited just now, which caused such a big misunderstanding."       "Brother Du is right, in fact, the two of us have always admired you like the water of the Yellow River, and like the Nine Heavens Milky Way!"       The two of them are really a pair of talents, and this sycophant kung fu is absolutely first-class.       For the virtues of these two people, Leng Feng is naturally clear. To be honest, he didn't bother with these two people at all in the first place, all of this was instigated by someone behind his back, and the two were just pawns who were pushed out.       "Hehe, I didn't expect the two of you to be so talented!" Leng Feng said with a slight mockery.       However, the two of them didn't seem to understand, but said to Leng Feng with a sincere face: "Feng is less than the award, my brothers can have today thanks to Young Master Feng's support back then!" ”
       What he said made Leng Feng really speechless. Sure enough, if a person is cheap, he is invincible, and the thick-skinned person who is embarrassed to a certain extent is not himself, but others.       When the other scholars saw the two of them behaving like this, they all turned their heads and looked at the two of them embarrassedly. This is not too disciplined, I was beaten by Leng Feng just now, and there was a big red nose on his face, and he turned his face and slapped Leng Feng's ass.       "Huh!" Leng Feng smiled and ignored the two of them.       At this moment, there was a commotion outside. I saw a large group of people walking in from outside, and this group of people had a much stronger aura than Leng Feng and these scholars.       The leader was a middle-aged man wearing an official uniform.       However, for Leng Feng, no matter in his past or present life, he didn't know what level of official this official uniform represented. However, judging by the position of the entourage, it is clear that this person is respected. Then it is not difficult to guess the identity of this person, it is the presiding official of the selection test in Linjiang City, the master of Jiankang Mansion.       On the left and right of Lord Xuedao were the magistrates and county governors of Linjiang City, and the rest were other officials, large and small, as well as the mountain chief and chief teacher of Linjiang Academy.       In fact, according to the past practice of the Southern Song Dynasty court, with a county like Linjiang City, there is no need for such a big battle in the selection of prodigy geniuses. The reason why the scholar of the state capital came in person was because of the special environment of the Southern Song Dynasty at this time.       At present, there are not many state capitals in the hands of the Southern Song court, especially only a few places that really obey the orders of the Southern Song court. Moreover, the partisan struggle in the court was very serious, and the promotion of officials was almost monopolized by various factions.Even if you want to make a difference today, you have to look at the faces of various parties. If all these parties oppose it, even the decree of the Son of Heaven will not be able to leave Lin'an, the capital of the country.       Unfortunately, when today's son continued to the throne, he was bent on making a difference, and he tossed several times before and after. However, it always ended in failure, and it almost tossed the few family foundations in the Southern Song Dynasty.       After reflection and summarization, the Ninety-Five Supreme in the court also figured out that the main reason why he failed repeatedly was that there were not many available materials under his rule.       If you want to make great efforts, only talents are indispensable!       If the command can have a large number of talented people, and they are loyal to today's saints, then why worry that the Great Song Dynasty cannot be prosperous.       So, that's why we have today's national genius selection test.       The Holy Lord personally arranged for several close ministers who were loyal to him to select a batch of available materials in the jurisdiction. Moreover, the selection method of this batch of talents is different from the past, and students with innocent backgrounds are directly selected in the academies of various state capitals.       Of course, the innocence of the background here is also relatively speaking, mainly because these scholars do not belong to the people of various factions, in order to skip the constraints of those factions.       Even if these people have a low starting point and no experience, in the eyes of the emperor of the temple, this is not a thing, as long as they are trained a little, they can become their own team.       Reducing talents without sticking to one pattern is the purpose of this selection of geniuses in each academy.       Of course, it is not possible to put it into the hands of the executive as the Holy God thinks today. After all, at this time, the Southern Song Dynasty court had rotted to the roots, like a big tree, the roots and trunk were almost rotten, and only one or two branches were still exuding vitality, which was useless for the big tree.       However, this is definitely the best opportunity for scholars all over the world, especially for scholars like Linjiang Academy, in their eyes.       Most of the scholars were born at the bottom of society, and they did not have a clear view of the battles at the court and the current situation. There are even many people who still fantasize that the imperial court can recover the lost territory in the north and reproduce the glory of the founding years of the Great Song Dynasty.       For this era, information underdevelopment also has the benefits of information underdevelopment, at least people's hearts will not be so panicked, and society will not collapse so quickly. Often, many times, it is only when the sword is added that people realize that they are already in troubled times.       The scholars in the entire Linjiang Academy, even including Liang Dong, are not clear about the current situation in the world. That is, Leng Feng, a traverser, has a God's perspective to know the general direction of future history.       Of course, knowing whether history can influence history or not is the greatest test for the reborn.       However, this is still too far away for the current cold front. The meal has to be eaten in one bite, and he is now on the second day of rebirth, and he can solve his potential danger before he can take this problem into account.If you don't sweep a house, how can you sweep the world in the future!       In fact, Leng Feng is not clear about the specific situation of today's imperial court, after all, he does not specialize in history, but only understands the general trend of this era. Specific to the dynamics of the court in each period, he is the same as Leng Feng of this era, and he is equally ignorant.       Master Xuedao's group did not pass by Leng Feng, but walked into the Wensheng Building of Linjiang Academy from the side road. Wensheng Building is the representative building of Linjiang Academy, which houses the tablet of Master Wensheng, and is also the most sacred place of Linjiang Academy. All major events in the Linjiang book are held here.       Today is no exception, this place has been arranged a long time ago, and it is the main venue for this selection test. Master Jiankang Mansion Xuedao sat at the top of the high platform, and there were four examiners on both sides. Several officials from Linjiang County sat on the side, and they were not also witnesses to the selection.       "Squeak!" With a bang, the door opened.       Li Hongqiu, the head of Linjiang Academy, and Chen Jiasheng, the chief teacher, walked out of it, followed by five young people, who looked about the same age as Leng Feng and the others. However, everyone didn't know these five people, and they didn't know where they came from, so they were able to follow the mountain chief and the others into here.       In this case, it is very disciplined. Although these students of Linjiang Academy have long known that the location of today's selection test is in Wensheng Building, they can only wait at the closest place to Wensheng Building, and they will not be able to enter Wensheng Building without being notified.       "Ladies and gentlemen, you are all people with both talent and virtue in my Linjiang Academy, and today is the time to test the results of several years of hard work. The so-called once famous in the world, I hope that some of you can become the pillars of the country, and I will be proud of you in Linjiang Academy! ”
       The mountain chief walked in front of the scholars, and simply said a few inspiring words, and the scholars who listened to them were boiling one by one, as if the pillars of the country that the mountain chief said were them.       Leng Feng was bored and dug his ears, he was not interested in the words of the mountain chief, but the five young people who appeared with the mountain chief made him a little interested. Instinctive instinct told him that the appearance of these five people here was not accidental, and there must be something wrong with them.       Sure enough, after the mountain chief gave all the scholars a lot of blood, he introduced these five young people to everyone. It turned out that these five people were new students who joined Linjiang Academy, and they also came to participate in this selection test.       And from the words of the mountain chief, it is not difficult to hear that these five people are here to pick peaches. They are different from Leng Feng, the reason why everyone is polite to Leng Feng is that in addition to Leng Feng's previous performance, there is another important reason, that is, everyone knows that Leng Feng is not learned and has no skills, and will not become a competitor in their selection.       Although the mountain chief said very vaguely and did not specifically introduce the origin of these five people, everyone was not stupid and naturally understood what was going on.       As a result, the faces of the scholars of Linjiang Academy became ugly. For the reactions of the scholars, the mountain chief also had a full view, and he had expected this situation for a long time. But there is no way for him to do this, after all, he is only a mountain chief of Linjiang Academy, which is equivalent to the current principal of the school, and he can't refuse the pressure from the top, so he can only try to appease the emotions of the students.       "Everyone, please be quiet and have good news for you. In this selection test, Master Xuedao has added ten more places for us to be famous. ”
       The mountain chief's words still had a certain effect, and everyone immediately fell silent.       After all, in Linjiang City, there are more than 100 scholars who participated in this test, and there are not many people who can stand out and win the top ten in the end, and most of the scholars are still rushing to get a fame.After all, in this era, the fame and identity of a scholar are still very precious. If you don't have an officially recognized fame, even if you have read a book for a lifetime, you can become a talent at most, and you don't have any privileges.       This time, the fame given by the imperial court is equivalent to that of the imperial examination, and this is different from the person who spends money to donate, it is the real official identity recognized by the imperial court. Meritorious people can have certain privileges, do not perform military service and do not pay taxes, and can also reasonably own private property and private soldiers in the nursing home.       In the past, people had to pass the imperial examination to be able to successfully go ashore, in addition to the imperial examination, there was also the donation of life, which was a false name that needed to spend a lot of money to buy. Although the fame given by the imperial court this time has no real job, it is still very valuable compared to the kind of fame that is donated by spending money.       For low-level scholars, this kind of opportunity is already precious.       However, it seems that this time there are still policies and countermeasures. Although the idea of the Holy Lord today is good, it is still exploited by others when it is implemented.       Take a small place like Linjiang County as an example, five of the ten places are held by those factions, and the remaining five places are still reserved for local scholars in Linjiang to take care of the feelings of today's saints.       And among these five places, no one dares to guarantee whether there are other related households in it.       Of course, these people also know that they can't do things too desperately, and they can fool the past by giving ten more fame in order to appease the people.       This kind of innocuous quota is not worth anything at all for those big people who are above the temple. This kind of fame with no real power is nothing in the eyes of those in power, and what they want to hold in their hands are those who have been appointed by the Holy God today, because these people are the ones who will be able to govern in the future.       Under the appeasement of the mountain chief, the scholars in Linjiang City also had to accept this reality, after all, the little arms can't twist the thighs, and it's useless to shout.       Finally, under the arrangement of the mountain chief and the chief teacher, everyone lined up and began to enter the Wensheng Building.       Leng Feng was ranked at the back of everyone, and just as everyone rushed in, the mountain chief and the chief teacher came to Leng Feng.       "It's not easy for you to get this opportunity! Leng Feng, you must perform well, this time there is a great chance to gain fame. ”
       "You must listen to the words of the mountain chief, don't make a mistake this time! This may be the last chance for you, your father is no longer there, and the Leng family will depend on you in the future. ”
       The chief teacher and the mountain chief began to tell Leng Feng, they knew what kind of temperament Leng Feng was, and if they didn't tell him well, they might make a mistake in any situation.       However, their worries were destined to be unnecessary, because the cold front at this time was no longer the cold front they knew.       Leng Feng knew that these two had been favored by his father, and this time Leng Feng's mother also asked these two to coordinate and get through some relationships.After the operation of these two people, not only did Leng Feng have the opportunity to enter this selection, but as long as Leng Feng did not perform so out-of-line in this selection, it should not be much of a problem to gain a fame. Leng Feng already knew this in advance, otherwise, with his usual performance in the past, it would not be his turn to have a chance to enter the Wensheng Building to participate in the selection anyway.       It can be said that nothing in this world is absolutely fair, and the matter of fighting dad exists at all times.       "Thank you for the mountain chief and Master Chen's mention, the kid will definitely remember it!" Leng Feng clenched his fists and bowed and said.       Looking at Leng Feng's very standard disciple ceremony, Li Shanchang and Master Chen couldn't help but be stunned. They were really surprised by Leng Feng's performance. Like everyone else, their perception of Leng Feng is still stuck in the past, and now Leng Feng's performance is really a little unacceptable in their opinion.       However, this was also a good thing for them, but after a short period of surprise, the two nodded in satisfaction with Leng Feng and waved him in.       After everyone entered the Wensheng Building, this selection test officially began.       After worshipping Master Wensheng, Xuedao Jiang Yuanzhi read out the edict of today's son, and put forward the requirements and ardent expectations for all students. After going through a whole process, the first round of test questions is issued.       In fact, this kind of selection test is not very new, and it is not much different from the traditional imperial examination. The only difference is that the process is simplified, and the form of assessment is relatively casual.       The traditional imperial examination is divided into three sections, namely Jingyi and rhyme, which is the so-called Baguwen. The last two sessions are the test scriptures and the test strategies, which are also known as the practical texts and the policy theories.       But today's selection test is different, there is not so many processes, and all the scholars present only need to write an article. Those who pass the article will receive fame and fame, and will have the opportunity to serve the imperial court in the future. Even this excellent article can be directly listened to by heaven, and the saints may see your article today.       If your essay is appreciated by the saints today, it is very likely that you will ascend to heaven in one step.       This kind of precedent is not unprecedented, although under normal circumstances, only the part of the palace examination, the Son of Heaven will personally preside over the examination, and the candidates' articles may be personally consulted by the Son of Heaven. But there are also cases where in the history of the Great Song Dynasty, there are also teenage prodigies who are the champions.       Moreover, the Great Song Dynasty in the context of this world, unlike other dynasties for the imperial examination, the Song Dynasty in this era seems to pay more attention to the selection of prodigies and geniuses in the selection of talents. In terms of the examination system, it is also relatively flexible.       The selection test of Linjiang Academy was presided over by Xuedao in person, and the content of the article required candidates to comment on the rights and wrongs of historical dynasties. This topic is very in-depth for everyone in Linjiang Academy. After all, most of the scholars here are only thirteen or fourteen-year-old teenagers, and it is difficult to write a decent article in terms of ideas and opinions.       The reason why such a question appears has a lot to do with the purpose of this selection.       The current saint is not a fool, and he knows that those factions will be used to lead this selection. It is also the result of a compromise between the two sides, the faction can arrange some of its own people to enter it, but the Holy One can also choose some people for their own use.       It seems that this kind of article is easy to use, but it is not easy to really write brilliantly. This is not only a test of the reader's mastery of historical dynasties, but also his own unique opinions. From the written essays, it is obvious that the cognitive level of the person answering the question, as well as the ability to insight.Whether a person has the ability to govern the world can be seen in this small article. Therefore, the level of the questions this time is still very high.       This test question was drawn up by the personnel of the Holy Organization and distributed to the responsible persons of each state capital, and then each state government arranged personnel to preside over the test in the counties and counties under its jurisdiction. Because Linjiang is located in the rear of Jiankang Road, it has experienced the least war, and it is also a rich place, so it is naturally the most valued.       As a result, the Master of the Dao came here to preside over the selection.       As for other counties and counties, they are much worse than Linjiang County, and there are only one or two places in some places.       After getting the test questions, Leng Feng smiled after a little thought. If he is asked to conduct the imperial examination honestly, he is self-aware, and he can't pass other scholars at all.       Writing eight-strand essays is not his strong point at all, but it is not difficult for him to write such a policy essay at all. I can't write it myself, can't I copy it?       The advantages of being a reborn person are revealed, although Leng Feng of this era does not learn and has no skills, but he still knows basic historical knowledge. The trend of the dynasties of this era is almost the same as the history he knew in his previous life, but the historical celebrities who appeared in each dynasty are different.       For example, the sage of literature in this era was not Confucius, but Confucius Wenzi. And now the saint of the Southern Song Dynasty court is not surnamed Zhao, but surnamed Jiang.       But there are also similarities, for example, there is also Yue Fei in this era, and it seems to be the same person as Yue Fei that Leng Feng knows. They all had the same experience, and they were all framed and killed by traitors, but the traitors who killed Yue Fei in this era were not called Qin Hui, but Peng Gao.       Over the Qin theory!       Leng Feng thought of an article he had studied, which was an essay written by Jia Yi in the Western Han Dynasty in the era in which he lived. This is a classical Chinese essay, when Leng Feng studied Qin Theory, he was still in middle school, and I felt that this article was difficult to understand and memorize.       But now he found a strange phenomenon, whether it was in the past life or in this life, his memory was extremely clear. As long as he has seen something, he can now reproduce it clearly and completely in his mind, and his comprehension ability is also very strong, and he can face the essence directly.       Could this special ability be the benefit of rebirth?       After thinking of Qin Theory, this article automatically appeared in Leng Feng's mind, and there was not even a single punctuation mark with the original text.       While the others were still pondering, Leng Feng had already picked up his pen and written. He is not worried at all about being found to be plagiarized, because there is no such character as Jia Yi in the history of this era.       Although Leng Feng is not good at academics, his calligraphy level is still good. This is mainly in the interest of his father. Although Leng Da Rich Man doted on Leng Feng, he worked Leng Feng's studies. When Leng Feng was enlightened, Leng Da Rich invited some calligraphers to educate Leng Feng's calligraphy.       There is still a certain reason for famous teachers to come out, and Leng Feng was not as sloppy as he was later at that time, so Leng Feng's calligraphy level was still good. And now that Leng Feng has crossed over, coupled with the works of those calligraphers he has seen in his previous life, this special ability to never forget has made his experience of calligraphy even more profound.       Therefore, as soon as Leng Feng's first word came out, he himself felt that it was very meaningful. This level of calligraphy has not reached this level in either previous or present lives.After a slight pause, Leng Feng waved his pen and began to write.       In the entire examination room of Wensheng Building, there were a total of 132 candidates. Except for a few candidates such as Leng Feng, the rest of the candidates were selected by the academy. In addition to Linjiang Academy, there are many large and small private schools in the entire Linjiang City, and there are nearly 1,000 students from ten to fourteen.       Most of the people have been eliminated in the first round, and the people who can appear here are all really talented. But now these people have not officially written except for Leng Feng.       It can be seen how difficult it is to write this article well.       "Who's that candidate?"       Xuedao Jiang Yuanzhi also noticed Leng Feng's movements and asked the mountain chief on the side. In fact, there are many people who have seen Leng Feng's behavior, but the Daoist Master did not speak, and they are not easy to discuss.       Mountain Chief Li Hongqiu also paid attention to Leng Feng, but he was not as surprised as the others, but frowned slightly. Others don't know Leng Feng, but he knows it, in his opinion, Leng Feng is a broken jar and started to make trouble again.       When he entered the door before, when he saw Leng Feng's humble and polite appearance, he thought that Leng Feng had reformed himself! Unexpectedly, I still thought too much about myself, this kid is still the same virtue as before!       "Alas, how could a person as reliable as Brother Hai give birth to such a jumping son!"       Just as Li Hongqiu was sighing in his heart, he heard Jiang Yuanzhi's question. I can only hope that Leng Feng can be reliable, and don't make any moths. This time, Leng Feng's matter has been sorted out up and down, even if the Lord Xuedao has also received benefits, as long as Leng Feng doesn't write any bullshit articles, it shouldn't be difficult to get a fame.       I'm afraid that the cold front is not too thick and I will scribble on the test paper.       "Master Huixuedao, this son's name is Leng Feng!" The mountain chief replied.       "Cold Front!" When Master Xuedao heard this, he nodded slightly. He knew this name, and he had received the best jade from someone before, saying that he wanted to take care of this son, how could he forget this name.       Although Jiang Yuanzhi is not a big corrupt official, he is not a very upright person. This man does not love gold or silver, but he loves jade. The piece of superb jade that the mountain chief gave him through a relationship made him love it, and now he is playing with it in his hands!       "Yes, this son has an extraordinary bearing, and his pen posture is quite strong and powerful, and he will be able to write a splendid article!" Xue Dao Jiang Yuanzhi said.       When the mountain chief heard what Jiang Yuanzhi said, the corners of his mouth twitched, but he couldn't help but speak, at this time he felt that it was not good for him to say anything.       The same is true for other people who know the details of the cold front, even the county magistrate is also the corner of his eyes jumping. As the supreme governor of Linjiang City, although the magistrate is not familiar with the situation in Linjiang City, he has heard of the situation of the richest man in Linjiang City.       However, not long after he became the magistrate of Linjiang City, Leng's father disappeared, so he didn't have much friendship with Leng Feng's family. Similarly, Leng Feng's two uncles don't have much friendship with this magistrate, otherwise, the Leng family's property would have been occupied long ago.It is precisely because everyone knows Leng Feng's situation that they are not optimistic about Leng Feng's performance, that is, the Lord Xuedao and several examiners are unknown, plus the benefits of receiving the Leng family, so they think Leng Feng is good.       However, they are not stupid, and seeing the reactions of the people around them, they seem to have noticed that something is wrong. Everyone is a thousand-year-old fox, and naturally knows the truth that if you say more, you will lose, so you keep your mouth shut.       In fact, Jiang Yuanzhi said that it was good, Leng Feng's performance at this time was really as he said. Putting aside everything else, Leng Feng's calligraphy is indeed good, coupled with the change in temperament after rebirth, this gesture is very generous.       Leng Feng's unconventional operation still affected some people, such as the five candidates who came with the Daoist Master. They didn't know the details of Leng Feng, and like the Daoist Masters, seeing Leng Feng waving ink could create a lot of psychological pressure for them.       As for the people in Linjiang Academy, they didn't care much when they saw Leng Feng's appearance.       The reactions of the others could no longer affect Leng Feng, and he was entering a wonderful state at this time. Although this article is not his original, it can be well integrated into the artistic conception.       This article aims to summarize the historical lessons of the fall of the Qin Dynasty, which is profound and artistically appealing.       More than 1,000 words describe the history of more than 100 years from Qin Xiaogong to Qin's demise, and generally explain the whole process and main phenomena of Qin's rise and fall, and explain the key to its rise and fall.       Due to the influence of the cold front, everyone's thinking time has been shortened this time, and the preparation time for writing this kind of article is not enough without one or two incense sticks. However, it only took Leng Feng a few breaths to put down the pen, even if they knew that Leng Feng might be pretending.       However, with the performance of the cold front first, if they ponder for too long, they will also leave a bad impression. Therefore, even if they slandered Leng Feng in their hearts, they could only speed up.       However, that's it, just when everyone just started the article, Leng Feng had already completed the answer.       "Whew!"       Leng Feng let out a long breath, then put down his pen.       Under normal circumstances, there is no such thing as submitting papers in advance for the imperial examination in this era, but this selection is not an imperial examination, and everyone is also very curious about Leng Feng's answer. When Leng Feng said that he wanted to hand in the papers, his test papers were also submitted.       "Good word!"       Leng Feng's test paper had just been opened, and the examiner who saw the test paper couldn't help but praise secretly. Not to mention anything else, it is this hand of calligraphy that can already see some patterns.       "Passing the Qin Theory!"       When Jiang Yuanzhi, a scholar of Taoism, saw the name of the article, his eyes couldn't help but light up, and he secretly said a good name in his heart.       As I continued to read, I was deeply attracted by the content of the article. Being able to become a scholar in the state capital of the road, the professional level in this area is still very high, and he can naturally see the quality of an article.From Leng Feng's article to the author of the article, the narrative of the Qin State from prosperity to decline and rise and fall is clear, grasping a vertical line from the rise of Qin Xiaogong to the death of the Qin Dynasty, and the layers of the article are extremely clear.       A certain point at a certain time is prominently laid out and brought into play, so that people can not only see the "line", but also see the "points" on the "line" that are emphatically described in thick ink and color.       The train of thought of the master of the Tao is led down by the nodes described in the article, and if the content of the article is not interrupted, he cannot be interrupted, and if the article does not have extraneous branches, he cannot side with the rest. The article of just over 1,000 words gave him a feeling of great momentum.       In the eyes of the scholars, another highlight of this article is that the author is writing an argumentative essay in the style of writing. Writing is extravagant and exaggerated, and this technique is used throughout this article.       For example, some words in the article: sweeping, encompassing, encompassing, annexing, the world, the universe, the four seas, the eight wildernesses, etc. It reads with great momentum, sharpness, aggressiveness, persuasiveness, and a sense of unstoppability.       What is more important is that the essence of the article is not just superficial rhetoric, and the views and opinions expressed are very clear and unique.       "Look at it!"       Master Xuedao read the article in one go, and then closed his eyes and reminisced about it, and did not comment on it, but passed the article on to others.       This kind of selection test is conducted openly, and unlike the previous imperial examination papers, several examiners will mark the papers on the spot, and finally the excellent test papers will be selected and handed over to the scholars to decide. Of course, if necessary, the Daoist master can also read the paper in person, such as the case of Leng Feng.       "Good, good article!"       Another chief examiner who followed the Master of Xuedao couldn't help but praise Leng Feng's article after reading it.       This made those who did not see the article very surprised, especially the mountain chief Li Hongqiu and others, whose hearts were as anxious as a cat's claw. With their understanding of Leng Feng, they were already ready, and when the Daoist Master read Leng Feng's article, he would look ugly.       But unexpectedly, their prediction was wrong, and it seemed to be outrageously wrong. Looking at the appearance of Master Xuedao, and the expressions of several other examiners, a thought that made them feel ridiculous rose in their hearts - could it be that Leng Feng wrote a splendid article.       As soon as this thought arose in their hearts, they immediately rejected it. In their opinion, the probability that Leng Feng will be able to write a splendid article is even less likely than that of a sow being able to climb a tree.       However, they couldn't see Leng Feng's test papers, and now all the scholars' answers were not over, at least until the Daoist Master finished reading the articles, they might have a chance to see it.       However, Master Xuedao and those examiners no longer paid attention to them, but exchanged ideas about Leng Feng's article.       "Wonderful! This treatise on the Qin dynasty compares the Qin state itself between its strength and then its weakness, its prosperity and then its decline, its prosperity and then its demise, the comparison between Qin and the Six Kingdoms, the comparison between Qin and Chen She, and the comparison between Chen Shi and the Six Kingdoms. Several contrasts are intertwined, and the structure of the article is naturally grand, the momentum is also naturally magnificent, and the words seem to have more weight. ”
       In particular, the argument and assertion in this last paragraph still use a comparative technique to synthesize several aspects and then draw conclusions, which is the so-called "judgment". In order to make the conclusion solemn, he brought Qin up again and said it again, and only then ended with "benevolence and righteousness are not applied and the offensive and defensive forces are different". The article must be able to be released and received, opened and closed, and the ability to be seen from the beginning. ”
       "Those who have passed the Qin theory will also talk about the mistakes of Qin; Qin Guo just cut off the last sentence of 'benevolence and righteousness' with one sentence! This and the essence of the article! ”
Although Jiang Yuanzhi and several examiners were talking softly, the people around them could also hear it, and they had already understood at this time, it turned out that Leng Feng had really written a splendid article.       At this time, other articles had already been written, but the fastest among them was also nearly two sticks of incense slower than Leng Feng. And looking at his articles, they are far less exciting than the articles written by Leng Feng, and the essence of them is not at the same level.       This made Xuedao's eyes full of doubts when he looked at the mountain chief and the others, that means that such an excellent talent, is it necessary for you to spend such a big price to leave the favor?       As a scholar of Yifu, of course he understands the causes and consequences of this selection, and he also knows that there is something wrong with it, they can even disobey the orders of the saints, but they still have to take into account the feelings of the people in the world. They can set five of the ten places, or they can take one or two of the remaining five for their own benefit, but they must leave two or three places for those who are truly talented.       Based on their reading of Leng Feng's article, they can be sure that this Leng Feng can beat many books by virtue of this article. Then this quota does not need to rely on external forces at all, it belongs to him.       However, in the eyes of Jiang Yuanzhi, the master of the Dao, this result is the best, because in this way, he will sell Leng Feng's favor without taking any risk. Although it is true that he received the benefits of Leng Feng, Leng Feng obtained this quota based on his real talent and learning.       And at the beginning, the person who gave Leng Feng a relationship just hoped to gain a fame, and as for the top ten opportunities to face the saint, it was not mentioned.       In this way, Jiang Yuanzhi was very satisfied, and even felt that this Leng Feng just wanted to convince him and join his faction. Therefore, when determining the ranking, he did not hesitate to set Leng Feng as the top of the list.       By noon, everyone had completed the selection test.       In fact, even half of the people who really answered all of them didn't reach it, even those who finished answering, and some of them wrote something that they couldn't even read.       However, because there is a screen between Master Xuedao and the other examiners and the scholars, the examiners can see the candidates, but the candidates cannot see what the examiners are doing. Therefore, these candidates only know that Leng Feng is the first to complete the answer sheet, and it is far more than the second person.       However, they didn't know how these examiners would perform after seeing Leng Feng's answers. Therefore, most scholars think that Leng Feng's behavior is self-defeating, and they don't take Leng Feng seriously in their hearts.       Even if Leng Feng has a lot of money, he is not a white one. If they can be fortunate enough to become one of the ten face saints, they will be the second best thing, and they will be able to gain fame, and their social status will not be comparable to Leng Feng.       There are many people who have such thoughts, that is, Du Zhang and the others, who also have this idea at this time. In their opinion, although they were praised by Leng Feng just now, if they can become the lucky one in this selection test, they will not look at Leng Feng's face in the future. Even if he was humiliated by Leng Feng today, he will be able to get back to the field in the future.       However, the ideal is beautiful, and the reality is always cruel. After a noon break, the scholars finally ushered in the turning point of their fate.       Although this selection test is not as strict as the imperial examination, today's Linjiang Academy is also allowed to enter but not leave. Of course, those who can enter Linjiang Academy must also obtain qualifications in advance, and once they enter here, no matter who they are, they cannot leave until the results come out.After the joint review of the students and several examiners, the results of all the scholars have been released.       In fact, it is very easy to determine the number of places in this form of selection test. After all, it is difficult to ask candidates to complete the test in an hour and a half under the premise that everyone will not know the content of the test in advance.       In this era, most of these scholars were accustomed to the process of the imperial examination. The normal imperial examination has plenty of time, and it is a township examination, which takes several days. And this selection test, which is equivalent to proposition essay writing in modern society, is still unaccustomed to these scholars.       As a result, a considerable number of people are not able to complete the answer within the allotted time. In the same way, these scholars who did not complete their answers were directly judged to be incompetent. This significantly reduces the workload of several examiners, as long as they are selected from less than half of the papers that have already been answered.       Moreover, some of the papers that have been answered have obvious defects of one kind or another.       Therefore, although it seems that there are more than 100 answer sheets, the real workload is not large. The main thing is to discuss the twenty or thirty answer sheets.       Among these twenty or thirty answer sheets, one answer sheet was undisputed and deservedly rated as the first grade. This answer sheet is Leng Feng's theory of the Qin Dynasty, whether it is from the perspective of writing or content, it is impossible to find fault.       Even the scholars who traveled with the scholars of the Dao were able to write articles comparable to those of the Qin Dynasty.       The five people brought by the Dao Master also had real talents and real learning, but since they belonged to the disciples of those factions, they were not qualified to enter this kind of selection if they did not join the local academy. These people are all from famous families, and whether they are knowledgeable or talented, they far surpass the scholars of various counties and counties.       For them, joining the academies of each county is just a formality, and almost all of them will enter the selection quota of each county. And they will all be ranked high, even in the top few of the selection in each region.       This is also the reason why those factions agree to this plan of being the son of today, because they are confident that they will make this plan their wedding dress. Not to mention that they occupy fifty percent of the selection quota, that is, those scholars of ordinary people, even after being selected by the Son of Heaven, they are confident that these civilian scholars will take refuge in their own camp.       Therefore, there is an inevitable reason for the demise of the Southern Song Dynasty, and in the case of foreign enemies, they do not know how to unite with the outside world, but they continue to fight internally.       The country cannot be without a king for a day, and there is some truth in this sentence. Now that the power of the king is almost hollowed out, and the civil and military generals among the ministers are divided into factions, it is simply unreasonable for such a court to not die.       Leng Feng is also well aware of this, so he will not have a sense of awe for the court of this era, and he will not care about the fame given by the court.       I hope that things in the world are always so wonderful, and the more you deliberately seek them, the farther and farther away they will be from you. On the contrary, if you don't take him to heart, he will take the initiative to find you.That was the case in today's selection test, where in an undisputed situation, Leng Feng took the top spot in the first division.       As soon as this ranking was released, it immediately caused an uproar among the scholars of Linjiang City. With their understanding of Leng Feng, they naturally won't believe that this ranking word is real, thinking that there is some conspiracy behind it.       Even if Leng Feng's behavior shocked some people before, and later words attracted a group of people, but in the face of this achievement, everything before seemed to be useless. What's more, the group of scholars that Leng Feng faced before was only a small group of people who participated in this selection, and many people didn't notice Leng Feng at all.       Leng Dashao's prestige is not false in Linjiang City, it is smashed out of real money, and almost no one does not know his glorious deeds.       Therefore, when these scholars saw the rankings, the scene was boiling instantly.       At this time, no one paid much attention to the five foreign scholars, even if they all occupied the top ten. Leng Feng also attracted firepower for them in disguise, which was tantamount to doing good deeds.       "Insider! We strongly protest! ”
       After seeing the list, the protests of the scholars came one after another. I don't know who took the lead in shouting the voice of protest, and emotions can be contagious, especially under preconceived circumstances.       "Presumptuous! Master Xuedao is here, you can't rebel if you want to! These rankings are all obtained by people with real talents, and they are not as good as others who only know how to coax, is this what a scholar should do! ”
       In the end, even the magistrate couldn't sit still, and he personally came forward to suppress the scene.       In fact, at first, the magistrate was also surprised to see the list, but after all the candidates' articles were judged by Lord Xuedao and others, they had the opportunity to see the articles. Including the mountain chief Li Hongqiu, they all saw the articles of Leng Feng and other outstanding people. At this glance, their reaction was very exciting.       The first feeling is that this can't be true, if they don't know Leng Feng very well, they will definitely wonder if Leng Feng knew the topic of this selection test in advance.       However, in their opinion, even Leng Feng knew the topic of this test in advance, and he couldn't find anyone to write such an excellent article for him.       This article is written by them, and it can't be better than Leng Feng's writing.       What's more, they can be sure that it is impossible for Leng Feng to know the topic in advance. Don't talk about Leng Feng, even the adults who learn the Tao will not know the topic in advance. Although Master Xuedao had already held the test questions in his hands, he would not risk being exterminated by the Nine Clans to peek at all.       Because they have so many ways to achieve their goals, there is no need to peek at the topic at all. This is also the result of the factional game of all parties, not that everyone has a sense of fairness, but a tacit understanding.       Anyway, whether you know the content of the test or not, it doesn't make much difference to those of them who operate it.       After hearing the noise of those scholars, the mountain chief and the others were in mixed feelings, and they could understand the thoughts of those scholars. But the facts are in front of us, and no one can refute them.       "Quiet, what kind of noise are you making like this!"In the end, it was the magistrate who personally came forward to suppress these emotional scholars.       After all, in Linjiang City, it is still one acre and three points of land for the county magistrate, and no one dares to violate the prestige of the county lord. However, the scholars are not ordinary people after all, although they dare not disobey the county master, but they will not just forget it.       "Lord Zhixian, you must know our doubts! Why can he Leng Feng be at the top of the list, isn't this an insult to me and other readers? A scholar spoke.       "Humiliation, you are worthy to say these two words! We'll copy the top 10 articles and post them outside, and if you still feel that this is a humiliation to you, then it's a humiliation! ”
       At this time, Master Xuedao also came out. Originally, he didn't need to come forward, but at this time he was very annoyed. I didn't expect the scholars of Linjiang City to be so bold and dare to question their decision.       Anyway, they didn't cheat this time, at least they didn't cheat on Leng Feng, and they just took this opportunity to justify themselves and others. In this way, no one will dare to find fault with the matter of placing five places in them.       After the first ten articles were copied, everyone saw Leng Feng's articles, and their eyes were full of disbelief. Someone rubbed his eyes and thought he had seen it wrong, and looked at it carefully from beginning to end.       "It's amazing, Feng Dashao is really a talent!"       "Feng Shao used to be wise and foolish, but now he is accumulating, and he is really a model for us!"       Du Zhang and the others reacted first, and sent their rainbow farts as soon as possible.       These two goods were beaten by Leng Feng before, and Leng Feng now got the top spot, no matter how they got it, at least in their opinion, this is the truth. And they also know Leng Feng's character, when Leng Feng's father was still there, they were Leng Feng's loyal lackeys. Later, after the second and third uncles of the Leng family took charge of the industry, these two took the lead in bullying Leng Feng.       As for now, they saw Leng Feng's powerful side again, and after being beaten, they slapped Leng Feng's ass again.       The way of survival of Du Zhang and his wife is to cling to the strong, which is closely related to their original family. The parents of these two were apprentices, and it was not easy for them to get into the shopkeeper of a shop under Leng Feng's father, although their living conditions have improved, but the humility in their bones has not changed.       The philosophy of the little people who climb up from the bottom to behave in the world naturally affects their children.       Regarding the performance of these two people, to be honest, Leng Feng didn't look at it at all, and he didn't take it to heart. Whether these two people were his own dogs before, or whether they rode on his head later to make a fortune, Leng Feng never took this kind of little person seriously.       Even now, in Leng Feng's heart, these two people are like grass on the wall, as long as you are stronger than them, they will never dare to bare their teeth in front of you.       In the face of the flattery of these two people, Leng Feng was too lazy to deal with it. However, Leng Feng's posture is in the eyes of others, that is the face of the young man's deafness, but it is a fight with the previous Leng Dashao.       In addition to Du Zhang and the others, those who saw Leng Feng's over-the-top treatise were still surprised. Although they were shocked by this article, many people still did not come back to their senses from their preconceived notions.       In this regard, these scholars are really not as good as Du Zhang and the others. Although the character of these two is not very good, the survival ability is definitely stronger than the others.Although the scholars were unwilling, no one dared to express different opinions on this matter. After all, facts speak louder than words, and articles of this level, even if they are not convinced in their hearts, they will not be able to say words to refute them.       For a moment, the faces of all the scholars were quite exciting. Some people are pondering, some are struggling, and some people's faces are as ugly as constipation.       Although the performance of the people varied, they had one thing in common, and that was that they had to be impressed by this article.       Although since ancient times, literati have been inferior to each other, and there is a saying that there is no first and no second, but it is really difficult for them to find fault with this article.       After this incident, Leng Feng's image among the scholars in Linjiang City has been changed. Although this change is not visible now, time will slowly change everything. Leng Dashao's character in this world also began to change from this day.       In fact, Leng Feng was able to win the title of the top spot in this selection test, not only because of this article, but also for many other reasons.       The belongings sent out by the Leng family also played a certain role. If there is no relationship between the Daoist Lord and the Daoist to play a certain role, Leng Feng's theory of passing Qin is impeccable, but it is not easy to get the top spot.       They could have been a little darker and didn't publish the top 10 articles, so that no one knew that Leng Feng's articles were so amazing.       After all, if Leng Feng had not won the top spot in this selection test, it would not have caused a backlash from many scholars, let alone the link of copying the top ten articles for publicity. In this way, others naturally can't see Leng Feng's article.       There is also a very important reason, that is, the five scholars who came to pick peaches with the Master of the Dao do not necessarily have to get the top spot, as long as they can get five opportunities to face saints within the top ten.       In addition, Leng Feng's two uncles couldn't afford Leng Feng at all, and in their inherent impression, Leng Feng was not a piece of material at all. This is also the reason why they are indifferent knowing that Leng Feng's mother took out her family funds to make a relationship.       In the eyes of Leng Feng's two uncles, it is not easy for Leng Feng to get a chance to become famous. What's more, they have already signaled Liang Dong to target Leng Feng in the academy, with Leng Feng's temperament, he will definitely cause some mistakes, and it is not certain whether he can participate in the selection or not.       is to take a step back, if there is an accident, Leng Feng will gain a reputation. In the eyes of the two uncles, this is not a big deal, at most it is just a little troublesome when they do it.       It was precisely because of the contempt of the two uncles for Leng Feng that Leng Feng did not face much resistance in the process of participating in the test.       "Ladies and gentlemen, do you still have any objections?"       Just when many scholars were still in amazement, Master Xuedao looked around the audience and spoke. Seeing that the scholars below were all speechless, Master Xuedao nodded with satisfaction.       This is all within his expectations, and if anyone dares to disagree at this time, it is either head iron or stupidity.There is absolutely no stupid person who can be selected from among the many scholars and enter the selection test. At this time, even if the scholars were sour and rotten as scholars, they also knew how to judge the situation. And everyone is not stupid, so they can naturally see the quality of the article.       Not to mention the rest, putting aside Leng Feng's identity, just talking about Qin's article made them happy and convinced.       At this point, the dust has settled on the selection test in Linjiang City, and naturally some people are happy and some are worried. However, except for the cold front, there were no other upsets.       In fact, this is also deliberately done by Xuedao and others, not just to prove to everyone that Leng Feng's matter is so simple. The main reason is to block the mouths of all scholars through Leng Feng's matter, so that no one will mention the matter of the five foreign scholars occupying the quota.       Although the results of the selection test have come out, there are still many follow-up matters. For example, those who pass this selection test have to go back and prepare apprenticeship stickers. This apprenticeship post does not mean to meet their former teacher, but to meet the master of the Dao.       There was a tradition in this era that anyone who passed the imperial examination or the selection test would meet the examiner of the current session afterwards and recognize them as the teacher.       This is a mutually beneficial good thing for both parties, after all, most scholars do not have a backstage. And those who can serve as the chief examiner have some influence in the officialdom, and if these candidates enter the officialdom in the future, it will be equivalent to having thighs.       And for the examiners, this is also an opportunity to strengthen their faction, and if these protégés develop well in the officialdom in the future, they will also help each other.       This is also the reason why those court officials knew the thoughts of the current saints, but not only did they not mean anything about this selection test, but they vigorously supported it.       In addition to preparing apprenticeship stickers, they also have to attend banquets held by the government. After all, this selection is also a big event for the Linjiang government. Especially these scholars who will have the opportunity to meet the saints in the future, they are all the faces of the Linjiang government, if some of them can go further, it will also be a great achievement for the Linjiang government.       Moreover, among the scholars, there will also be a classmate banquet and a teacher appreciation banquet.       In short, according to the usual practice, in the next period of time, these selected scholars or scholars who have gained fame will be busy with this matter.       But with the exception of Leng Feng, he doesn't have these thoughts. I have just crossed into this era, so it's better to think about how to develop my strength.       After Master Xuedao left, the people who entered the top ten became the focus of everyone, and everyone was surrounded by many compliments. Even the five scholars who came with the Daoist Master were also surrounded by everyone. After all, for them, although these five people are outsiders, they also occupy their places, which is equivalent to classmates.       Leng Feng's side was no exception, in addition to Du Zhang and the others following closely, there were more than a dozen scholars who also surrounded him and refused to disperse. Leng Feng was a blockbuster this time, and no one would have thought that Leng Feng would be able to win the top spot in this selection test.       If the previous Leng Da Shao could win this honor, then the tail should not go up to the sky. But at this time, Leng Feng seemed very calm, in his opinion, this was not obtained by his true ability, so naturally he would not take him too seriously. And he comes from the twenty-first century, and he is not interested in the system of this era.       Simply dealing with a circle of people who complimented him, Leng Feng was almost overwhelmed. It's not that it's hard for him to deal with these people, but it's that it's too boring to be with these little kids.No matter what, the two lives add up to dozens of years old, not to mention that in order not to arouse suspicion, you have to try to pretend to be the original cold and young demeanor.       After all, before yesterday, Leng Dashao was still a young man who did not learn and did not know how to do it, and it was already exciting enough to be able to write such an amazing article as Qin Lun today. If he shows a completely different style of character, then even these scholars who are ignorant of the world may also have doubts about his identity.       "Ladies and gentlemen, it's a fluke to be at the top of the list! The so-called article is made by nature, and the magic hand is handy. It just so happened that I was interested in the history of the Qin Dynasty recently, and I had consulted a lot of records about the Qin Dynasty. I've been thinking about this for a long time, but I didn't expect that today's test question is exactly what I feel in my heart, and this article will come naturally! If you want to change the topic, you can't do anything about it! ”
       Leng Feng clenched his fists to the surrounding crowd and said, don't say it, these scholars really believed his words. After all, Leng Feng's character is there, and only this reason can be explained. If it is really like what Leng Feng said, they have also painstakingly studied a piece of history, maybe they can hold back a good article.       The scholars of this era are like this, they have a strong sense of substitution, and there are still some unconvincing elements in their hearts. If you think about it this way, it can also prove that they are not worse than Leng Feng, but they are just not as lucky as Leng Feng.       "The article is made by nature, and the magic hand is happening! This is very exquisite, with such a great talent, it is no wonder that Brother Leng can win the top spot, which really makes me admire! ”
       Leng Feng's words really played a certain role, and all the scholars inevitably complimented each other.       After that, the scholars who had already been selected also recovered from their excitement. Naturally, they shared this joy with more people in their hearts, so everyone dispersed and prepared to go home to report the good news.       A group of people walked towards the gate of the academy, and the formation of the faint team opened. Leng Feng and the others who won the top ten walked in the front like the stars and the moon, followed by the twenty people who received ordinary fame, and then most of the people who were not selected.       The class concept of this era is so distinct, a moment ago everyone can talk together, and after an exam, people are divided into three, six, nine and so on.       In fact, the college entrance examination in the 21st century also has this shadow, but it is not as influential as this era.       The outside of the academy was already packed at this time, and most of them were the families of more than a hundred scholars here. This is very similar to the parents who are waiting outside in the modern college entrance examination.       Of course, this kind of selection test is more important than today's college entrance examination, after all, there is a golden house in the book, and it is nonsense to say that there is jade in the book.       In addition to the families of the scholars, many social idlers also rushed over to join in the fun. Therefore, the scene outside was a little chaotic, if it weren't for the soldiers guarding the gate of the academy, maybe the gate of the academy would not be able to stop these people.       Leng Feng is in a good mood today, this is the first step he has taken since his rebirth, although the status of the top of the selection list is not of substantial help to him now, but for his future development, it will be more convenient.       Yesterday, when he was thinking about his life, he was still thinking about how to form his own forces, and he didn't expect that he would have an opportunity today.       With ordinary fame, he can legally own some private soldiers in the nursing home in this era, not to mention that he is at the top of the list.       As soon as today's results came out, the magistrates of the county had to look at him differently. Not to mention anything else, the emperors and ministers of this era like to promote and reuse people with the title of prodigy.Once Leng Feng can rise to the top, the future achievements will definitely not be comparable to a county.       In other words, if Leng Feng can continue to perform as well as he does today, his future is definitely promising. This is also the reason why when many scholars had doubts before, Zhixian stood on Leng Feng's side, which was also showing favor to Leng Feng.       As soon as Leng Feng walked out of the gate of the academy with his front feet, his gaze immediately became cold, and he walked quickly in the direction of a crowd.       There was a circle of people there, and a little girl could be faintly heard crying, and an old carriage could be seen through the crowd.       This carriage is Leng Feng's house, and Leng Feng took this carriage to catch the exam today.       Leng Feng could already hear that the crying girl's voice was from Fluttershy. And his own carriage was surrounded by a crowd, something bad must have happened.       As Leng Feng walks briskly towards the crowd, three teenagers in the crowd are tugging at Fluttershy and spitting foul language.       "Little lady, what future can you have with Leng Feng's waste! It's better to follow the young master, I promise to let you eat and drink spicy food! ”
       "Little beauty, you are from Zhou Shao! That Leng Feng can't even feed himself now, look at you thin! You see, we still know that Zhou Shao is distressed! ”
       "Hahaha, Zhou Shaohui is still distressed, and I can't see the little beauty pitied"       "Yes, this is to save you from the dire situation!"       The three teenagers sang and harmonized, and they looked quite arrogant. Fluttershy is a weak woman who has little power to resist the bullying of these three bad boys. Chai Bo was old and frail, and they had knocked him to the ground, and one of his feet was still on Chai Bo's chest.       Fluttershy hasn't grown yet, and she looks malnourished, but she's a beautiful woman. This appearance seems to have a different flavor in the eyes of some people, and these three bad queens are obviously crooked.       The surrounding group of people obviously knew these three people, and although many of them showed a look of indignation, they didn't dare to stop them.       This Zhou Shao has the title of Little Overlord in Linjiang City, and this person's name is Zhou Tong, who is two years older than Leng Feng. Like Leng Dashao before, he is also a young man who does not learn and has no skills.       However, this week, Tong's family is playing a dart game, and his people are also five big and three thick, with the image of a reckless man. is also studying at Linjiang Academy, and Leng Feng is a classmate.       At the beginning, Leng Feng and Zhou Tong were known as the two major public hazards of Linjiang College, and the mention of the two of them was terrifying. However, Leng Feng and Zhou Tong did not smell like each other, but looked at each other unpleasantly.       But at that time, Leng Feng's father, Leng Da Rich, was still there. The name of the richest man in Linjiang City is not covered, he has connections in all aspects of Linjiang City, although the strength of the Zhou family's dart game is not weak, but it is still weaker than the relationship between the rich man of Leng Da. At that time, although Zhou Tong bullied men and women in Linjiang City, he still had to retreat when facing Leng Feng.The difference between Leng Feng and Zhou Tong is that although he is also a young man who does not learn and has no skills, he does not bully men and women many times.       Zhou Tong likes to bully people with force, while Leng Feng likes to bully people with silver. The people who have been bullied by Zhou Tong are scared away when they see him, but the people who have been bullied by Leng Feng will expect Leng Feng to continue to bully him.       This is the difference between the two, they are also very young, one is disgusted by thousands of people, and the other is hated and loved.       Later, Leng Feng's family's property was occupied by the second and third uncles, and Zhou Tong did not take Leng Feng in his eyes from then on. Although he didn't beat Leng Feng with his hands, he blackmailed him with a lot of silver.       It wasn't until Leng Feng left Linjiang Academy that this guy didn't have much trouble with Leng Feng.       This situation made a cloud of anger rise in Leng Feng's heart, and new hatred and old hatred surged into his heart together. In Linjiang City, Leng Feng's biggest enemy is this little overlord Zhou Tong, although Leng Feng's two uncles have always wanted to murder him, but the two uncles have covered it up very well, Leng Feng didn't notice much of anything unusual before, so he didn't have much hatred for the two uncles.       That is, Leng Feng after being reborn, only to discover the ambitions of the two uncles.       And this little overlord Zhou Tong's bullying of him is indeed real, in the memory of the original owner, if you want to find the person you hate the most, then it must be this person.       Leng Feng had a gloomy face, and quickly walked through the crowd, barely alarming anyone, and came behind the little overlord Zhou Tong in a few arrow steps. Since the three of them were facing away from Leng Feng, they did not notice Leng Feng's arrival.       Of course, this is also a reaction under the instinct of the cold front. In his previous life, as the king of the special combat team, Leng Feng had extremely rich combat experience, and he knew that he was not the opponent of the little overlord Zhou Tong at this time.       Without further ado, Leng Feng punched straight and hit the back of the little overlord Zhou Tong fiercely.       "Hmm!" The little overlord Zhou Tong snorted, and he stumbled and almost fell to the ground.       Before, this guy was getting carried away and stomping his foot on Chai Bo's chest, and was attacked by Leng Feng, and he almost lost his breath.       The back of the heart is an important acupoint of the human body, and it is easy to lose combat effectiveness after being hit hard. Even if it was the five big and three thick of the little overlord Zhou Tongchang, he was attacked by Leng Feng from the back of his heart, and his face was distorted and gasped.       suddenly turned around and found that the person who attacked him behind his back turned out to be Leng Feng.       "Waste material surnamed Leng, you dare to sneak attack me! Damn, I'm going to abolish you today! What are you two still standing stupidly for, go up and him! The little overlord Zhou Tong roared loudly while baring his teeth.       Those two teenagers are the followers of the little overlord Zhou Tong, similar to the roles of Du and Zhang. Although these three people are all students of Linjiang Academy, they are obviously the kind of goods that can't be supported by mud, and they are all at the bottom of the school academically.       These three were all born in the dart game, and they have lived in a group of rough men since they were children, and they are different from Du Zhang. The parents of those two still expect them to get ahead in their studies, so they still dare not be sloppy in their studies. But these three people are different, neither they nor their parents in the family think of them as a piece of reading material.       So these people have developed a character of not being able to study well and causing trouble everywhere since they were young.Usually they beat people, but now the little overlord Zhou Tong has obviously suffered a loss under Leng Feng's hands, where can he bear it.       The two attendants were scolded loudly by him, and then they came back to their senses, and immediately pounced on Leng Feng with their teeth and claws. Although they have not learned much real kung fu, their physical fitness and fighting skills far exceed ordinary people.       But it's a pity that the cold front they are facing today today is no longer the waste wood young master they once were. Although Leng Feng is even inferior to these three in terms of pure force, he has too much experience in martial arts.       Just as the two of them rushed towards him, Leng Feng's body swayed slightly from side to side, his hands were put together, and the sticky words in the Tai Chi push hand were used by Leng Feng on the two of them.       In his previous life, before Leng Feng joined the special combat team and became the king of soldiers, he met the chief instructor who taught fighting skills was the successor of Chen's Taijiquan. At that time, Leng Feng's family forging technique had reached the second stage, and his body functions were extremely perverted, so he was an excellent candidate for learning Taijiquan.       When the chief instructor saw Leng Feng, it was like seeing a treasure, so he taught him the essence of Chen-style Taijiquan. After learning orthodox Taijiquan, Leng Feng realized how wrong his previous understanding of Taijiquan was. Tai Chi is not the aerobics of the old man in the park, the real Tai Chi is a broad and profound martial arts.       The more I learned the essence of it, the more I felt that it was not easy. In the past, Leng Feng's body forging technique did not have any attack power, only to change the physique, but after mastering the essence of Taijiquan, their combat effectiveness was substantially improved.       This is also an important reason why Leng Feng later became the captain of the special combat team and won the championship of the whole army competition.       Now after being reborn, although the quality of this body is not good, the instinct imprinted in the memory has not changed.       The true essence of Taijiquan is to emphasize the mind and not the form, and with Leng Feng's current skills, there is not much problem in dealing with these two people. Especially in this era, people don't know what Tai Chi is, which makes it even more difficult to guard.       The two of them only felt that after Leng Feng's hand touched their arms, there seemed to be an invisible suction force that changed the direction of their punches, and their bodies involuntarily turned.       It was just such a slight change, and the fists of the two passed through the gap on the left and right sides of the cold front. Then Leng Feng leaned forward, looking crumbling, but he dodged the attack of the two just right.       After the two lost their goals, they suddenly found that it was their own people who appeared in front of them, but it was too late to stop at this time, so the two collided fiercely.       "Bah!"       "Ouch!"       The sound of bodies colliding, plus two wails, rang out almost simultaneously.       It all seems like a long time, but it only happens in one or two breaths, and many people don't realize what it's all about. Even the scholars who came out with Leng Feng had just squeezed into the crowd.       "Waste, you two can't even deal with Leng Feng, and your strength is used on the little girl's body!"The little overlord Zhou Tong had already relieved his breath at this time, although his heart was still aching faintly, but with his strong physique, it was basically fine. This is also because Leng Feng's physical fitness is too weak, if he can play one-tenth of the level of his previous life, he can at least ask for Zhou Tong's half life with one punch.       However, it is a pity that Leng Feng's current body is still too weak, and the little strength that has just awakened in his body has still not completely gotten rid of the category of powerlessness.       "Hah!"       I saw Zhou Tong suddenly shout, his body bent like a bow, his fists clenched and his muscles knotted. The reason why Zhou Tong is called the little bully is not only because of his domineering style, but more importantly, because he is powerful and powerful, and his skills are also good.       "Young Master, be careful!"       Seeing this, Fluttershy's face immediately fills with a look of concern, and she reminds Leng Feng. Fluttershy had been bullied by the trio before, but she didn't suffer much. It was Chai Bo who was knocked to the ground by Zhou Tong and others when he was blocked, and he was trampled on by Zhou Tong and couldn't move.       "Young master, go quickly!"       At this time, Chai Bo also got up from the ground and waved to Leng Feng and said.       In the eyes of the two of them, Leng Feng was not Zhou Tong's opponent at all, and he had unexpectedly attacked Zhou Tong before. Now that he is facing the enemy with Zhou Tong, he will definitely suffer a big loss.       "Humph! Zhou Tong, you are so capable, you can only bully the old and weak, women and children! Leng Feng didn't care about Zhou Tong's menacing appearance at all, but turned on the mockery mode.       "Ahh I'm going to beat you up! ”
       Zhou Tong roared angrily, and his body was like a tiger descending from the mountain, attacking Leng Feng. Zhou Tong's fist and foot kung fu is good, although it seems reckless, but the punch is very orderly. A simple straight punch enveloped Leng Feng's body, if Leng Feng was still the original young master, he would definitely not be able to dodge this punch.       However, in the face of Zhou Tong's ferocious punch, the corners of Leng Feng's mouth only showed a sneer. Although Zhou Tong's fist and foot kung fu is good, he can only be regarded as an ordinary martial artist, with a body of brute strength. Although Leng Feng's strength was not as strong as his, it was not much of a problem to dodge.       Leng Feng quickly took two steps back, dodging Zhou Tong's powerful punch.       Zhou Tong saw that Leng Feng didn't dare to touch his fist, and his momentum rose even more, and he immediately changed his fist to a leg, and swept towards Leng Feng's chest with the sound of whirring wind in his right leg.       "Tiger Fist!" Mainly fierce.       This is the little overlord Zhou Tong's specialty boxing skills, this set of boxing techniques was beaten by him quite well, and he won the essence of tiger pounce.       Leng Feng flashed and retreated, and he had already retreated five or six steps, but although his body seemed to be unstable, he could just avoid Zhou Tong's attack range. This is not that Leng Feng did it deliberately, but that he really can't compete with Zhou Tong now.       Zhou Tong's strength is several times that of his, that is, Leng Feng is deeply rooted in the essence of Taijiquan, and pulling out a thousand catties in four taels is not really able to pull out a thousand catties with the power of four taels. In the case of such a huge difference in strength, it is completely possible to break through ten thousand laws with one force.       Therefore, the cold front can only avoid its edge now. The best way to deal with Tiger Boxing is not to go head-to-head with the opponent, especially if the strength is not as good as the opponent's, only to wait for the opponent's boxing to pass before counterattacking.       Of course, there is a big premise for this, which is that you have to be able to dodge the opponent's attacks.       "Okay, Zhou Shao is mighty!"The two followers who collided with each other and fell to the ground also stood up at this time, and the two saw Zhou Tong punching and kicking Leng Feng to keep retreating, and immediately slapped their asses loudly.       However, they didn't pay attention to these two at this time, and everyone's eyes were on Zhou Tong. At the gate of Linjiang Academy, they are more or less related to the academy, or someone in the family is studying in the academy. They naturally know about the little overlord Zhou Tong, and most people are not optimistic about Leng Feng in their hearts.       Although Leng Feng has not been defeated by Zhou Tong for the time being, in their opinion, it is a matter of time before Leng Feng is defeated.       "Alas! It's a pity, if the rich man Leng is still there, how dare this little overlord Zhou Tong provoke Leng Dashao! ”
       "Isn't it! The strength of the Leng rich man's comptoir guard team is no worse than that of the Fuwei Dart Bureau, but unfortunately they all folded in the north with the Leng rich man! ”
       There were people in the crowd who lamented. Although they couldn't get used to Zhou Tong, they didn't dare to step forward to stop it. However, the main thing is that they don't know that Leng Feng has already achieved the top spot in this test, and if they knew, then they wouldn't be just watching the excitement from the sidelines.       Because of the top of this selection test, it is a saint who has to face the saint, and he may become a big official in the future. People are utilitarian and naturally know how to make trade-offs.       But just because these people are indifferent doesn't mean that everyone else will do the same.       "Zhou Tong, stop it!"       "Zhou Tong, you sloppy, how can you bully the body of a cold young man, and you don't stop admitting your mistakes!"       "Zhou Tong, you are so bold!"       "Zhou Tong thief dares!"       Suddenly, there were several sounds of exasperation. It turned out that those scholars saw Zhou Tong attacking Leng Feng fiercely, and Leng Feng was even more dangerous, under Zhou Tong's attack, like a flat boat in the stormy waves.       These scholars have seen the importance that Lord Xuedao and Lord Zhixian attach to Leng Feng, and they also understand that this is a good opportunity to tie up Leng Feng.       The reaction of these scholars blinded everyone, although they were not ashamed of being thoughtful, but they also knew what kind of goods Leng Dashao was. That is, compared with Zhou Tongyi, everyone will sympathize with Leng Dashao, if the two of them are taken out alone, they will have a bad impression in everyone's hearts.       When did the scholars in Linjiang City treat Leng Feng so well, and looking at the attitudes of these scholars, they couldn't wait to rush up and beat Zhou Tong to death one by one.       However, the fact is also that these powerless scholars flocked to Zhou Tong in a swarm of this matter.       This battle also startled Zhou Tong, and the movements in his hands naturally slowed down. He Zhou Tong's title of the little overlord was not blown out, and it was really fought with his fists. Usually these scholars are hiding when they see him, but today is it because he took the wrong medicine!       Not only Zhou Tong, but everyone present thought the same way.       Leng Feng was used to Zhou Tong's style of play at this time, but no one stopped him, and he also believed that he could find an opportunity to counterattack. But that's fine, everything is under your control, and now is still the time not to reveal your strength.       "Zhou Tong, you're done this time, Leng Dashao is now at the top of the list, if you hurt a single hair, you won't be able to eat and walk around!"       A loud shout came, and it turned out to be Du Zhang and the others jumping out. They want to perform in front of Leng Feng, so they are naturally no longer afraid of Zhou Tong.At this time, everyone understood why these scholars reacted so violently, not because they took the wrong medicine, but because they took the fierce medicine. Leng Feng became the top of the list in this selection test, no wonder these scholars maintained Leng Feng so much.       "Wait, am I mistaken? Leng Feng is at the top of this selection test! ”
       Just when everyone just felt that they understood the reason, they suddenly reacted that there seemed to be something wrong with each other.       Leng Feng actually won the top spot in the selection test, this news is too shocking. If it weren't for seeing so many scholars standing up for Leng Feng and Zhou Tong being tough, they really doubted that this was a big joke.       "What, you said Leng Feng won the top spot!"       Even if it was Zhou Tong, he was confused at this time. For him, this made his heart tremble even more than the moment Leng Feng sneaked up on him just now.       What does this mean, although he is stupid, he is not stupid, if Leng Feng really wins the top spot, then he really can't afford to provoke Leng Feng. At least in the near future, he has to avoid the cold front, at least until he understands the specific situation before making a decision
       Thinking of this, Zhou Tong also stopped moving, and immediately said with a roll of his eyes: "Leng Feng, how much money did you spend to buy these guys to say that you are ridiculous, at your level, you can get the top spot in the selection test, don't say I don't believe it, even if everyone present doesn't believe it!"       However, today's sneak attack on my account will be counted for the time being, and we will calculate it later! ”
       This really made many people around believe it, after all, the reputation of Young Master Leng is known to everyone in Linjiang City. Zhou Tong said that he paid these people to help him lie, and this credibility is really beyond the credibility of Leng Feng to win the top spot.       In fact, Zhou Tong, who said this, was beating a drum in his heart, and he had already believed the words of these scholars. Because he is also a member of Linjiang Academy, he knows that it is impossible for all of these scholars to be bought by Leng Feng, at least in the current situation.       Then there is only one truth, that is, what they said is true, Leng Feng did win the top spot. But at this time, he will definitely not admit it, and he will leave here first. Zhou Tong knows what kind of virtue these scholars are, especially those sour and rotten people, and there are really people who are not afraid of his fists.       There are not many scholars who have come over now, only about a dozen, and if most of them come over, then they really can't cope today. Especially on today's kind of day, the people in power in Linjiang City are all in Linjiang Academy, once the matter is big, today has to take off the skin.       Seeing Zhou Tong standing there stunned, looking dumbfounded, but in fact, his eyes were rolling in his bones, Leng Feng understood what he was thinking.       However, Leng Feng didn't plan to do anything to Zhou Tong today, anyway, it will be a long time coming, and he will have a chance to clean him up in the future. Although cleaning up Zhou Tong can make himself cool for a while, it will inevitably expose some means, which will make those who really want to put him to death prevent it in advance.       Zhou Tong is hateful, but he is not the person who must be eliminated in front of him.       "Zhou Dashao's ability to sue the wicked first is not weak, why don't you say why I want to attack you?" When Leng Feng saw Zhou Tong's appearance, he knew that he wanted to slip away, so he mocked it first.       "You're sneaking up on me anyway!"       Zhou Tong knew that he couldn't say Leng Feng, so he could only pretend to be stunned at this time.       "Brother Leng, don't worry about him like this, wait for him to write a letter for Brother Leng one day, and ask the magistrate to punish such villains!"       "Yes, we will definitely write for Brother Leng!"Although everyone dared to step forward and be tough with Zhou Tong just now, this kind of courage could not last long. Especially when facing a martial artist like Xiaobawang Zhou Tong, the pressure was several times greater than when he faced Leng Feng and beat Du Zhang and the others before. Under this pause, the momentum was lost by three points, and there was no longer the momentum just now.       Therefore, everyone is selling favors to Leng Feng, and they are also looking for a step down for themselves and others.       Otherwise, do you really think that they dare to fight with Zhou Tong! On this point, Leng Feng saw it very clearly.       "Thank you, I Leng Feng wrote down this favor, and I will be useful in the future, please just speak!"       However, Leng Feng saw through it and didn't say it, he knew that Tou Tiewa had no friends. The so-called sedan chair carries people, and there is nothing to lose by moving their mouths, so that both parties are happy, isn't it?       "Brother Leng is serious, we are all classmates, how can we let Brother Leng be bullied by such a splash!"       The scholars are also very suitable for the occasion, and it seems that everyone is really good friends!       Zhou Tong left with two followers, but no one paid attention to him at this time. The news that Leng Feng obtained this selection test is indeed shocking, everyone seems to be looking at him like a rarity, who cares about his little overlord's face.       Even Leng Feng, a person like Leng Feng, who is a two-worldly person, can't stand this kind of staring. In the end, he finally got rid of everyone and returned home in Chai Bo's carriage.       That's when he is able to talk to Fluttershy and learn what happened. That is, the little overlord Zhou Tong didn't know which one was wrong today, and came to the gate of the academy to join in the fun. With the character of the little overlord Zhou Tong, he knew that he was not treated well in the academy, although he was still a student of Linjiang Academy, but he generally did not participate in this kind of occasion.       When Zhou Tong, the little overlord, sees Fluttershy, he naturally recognizes her as Leng Feng's maid, and this is the time to step forward and flirt.       On the one hand, he does fall in love with Fluttershy's beauty, and on the other hand, it is also for the purpose of targeting Cold Front. In Zhou Tong's opinion, Leng Feng and him are the same goods, and it is definitely not material for reading, even if Leng Feng participates in the selection test today, it is not interesting to be self-deprecating.       But he guessed the beginning, not the result.       With Leng Feng's departure, the news about him winning the top spot slowly spread, and the invisible influence is slowly spreading.       "Damn, how could he Leng Feng get the top spot in the selection test? It's really annoying to me! ”
       In a courtyard in Linjiang City, the little overlord Zhou Tong and his two followers were furious. At this time, Zhou Tong's face was flushed, the green tendons on his neck were bursting up, and he held a stone lock in each hand, and the dancing tiger was in the wind.       "Zhou Shao was angry, and he was angry! Isn't that Leng Feng just shit lucky, he can get the top spot, there must be some ulterior secret behind it! ”
       "Yes, we don't know who Leng Feng is! If he can get the top spot, then our brother can also be the champion! ”
       "Nonsense, don't I know that Leng Feng must be tired at the top of the list! But now he's really at the top of the list, and we can do anything about it! ”
       Zhou Tong threw a pair of stone locks on the ground and sat down."Zhou Shao, I don't think this is necessarily a good thing. I think that Leng Feng has no two catties of goods in his belly, it is a fluke to get the top spot at this time, and he will definitely meet the saint in the future, and when the time comes, he will show his feet in front of the saint, I see how many heads he has enough to cut off! ”
       "Well, that's right. Even if he Leng Feng now won the top spot with his shit luck, once he shows his feet in the future, it will definitely be a crime of bullying. But it's a pity that we really can't do anything about him during this time! ”
       In addition to Zhou Tong, Leng Feng's second and third uncles also learned the news as soon as possible. Their reaction was no worse than Zhou Tong's, the teacup in the second uncle's hand had been smashed by him, and his face was pale.       The third uncle also had a gloomy face and looked constipated.       "Top of the list! Hehe, my good nephew, he really gave his ancestors a long face! The second uncle said with a sneer.       "Second brother, what do you think we should do now?"       "What to do, what to do. But the plan had to be advanced, didn't he get the top spot in the selection test, and if there was an accident at the top of the list, then the second one should thank us! The second uncle said sadly.       "Second brother, what do you mean?"       "Arrange it, get ready to do it, the sooner the better!"       These two groups of people won the top spot because of Leng Feng, and they all hated it. However, they treated Leng Feng differently, people like Zhou Tong could only choose to forbear for the time being, while Leng Feng's second and third uncles were stimulated by this incident and decided to attack Leng Feng in advance.       Mountain Chief Li Hongqiu and Chief Teacher Chen Jiasheng were also talking about Leng Feng, and the two were chatting with emotion on their faces.       In this selection test, they would never have thought that Leng Feng would be able to make the top 10 in any case. What's more, Leng Feng is not only selected now, but has also become the top of the ten Face Saints with the qualification of being at the top of the list.       Leng Feng grew up watching these two people, and he naturally knows Leng Feng's personality and knowledge. Especially this time, if it weren't for the fact that they had received the favor of Leng Feng's father, and they also vaguely noticed that Leng Feng's second and third uncles seemed to have bad intentions towards Leng Feng, they would not have been busy for Leng Feng to gain a fame.       "Master Chen, you said that Leng Feng, this kid, really gave us a surprise!"       "What the mountain chief said is very true, Shibei should be impressed in three days! When Leng Feng left the academy two years ago, he thought that he would sink like this, but he didn't expect that he would be so talented now! ”
       "Judging from the level of that article, you and I can't match it!" The mountain chief twisted his beard and said with emotion.       "So is it really just a coincidence, as Leng Feng said?"       The two of them picked up the teacups and discussed while sipping tea.       It turned out that Leng Feng's remarks in the academy and the scholars had also reached the ears of the mountain chief and Master Chen. But they are not those scholars after all, and with their understanding of Leng Feng, they still have doubts about Leng Feng's statement.       "If it is really as Leng Feng said, he is more interested in this history of the Qin Dynasty, and he has written similar articles before, it is really possible!" The mountain chief said.       "However, with Leng Feng's insight and talent, it is really unbelievable to want to write such an article that makes us ashamed!"       Master Chen still believes too much in this possibility, after all, he used to be Leng Feng's mentor, and he still knows Leng Feng's roots very well. A person's level is there, even if he feels it in his heart, he may not be able to express it in writing.       "So, is there a possibility that Leng Feng has been guided by a master!""It's a big possibility. Over the years, the rich man Leng has made a lot of strange people, maybe during this time, someone really pointed out Leng Feng! ”
       "If that's the case, it makes sense."       Fortunately, Leng Feng didn't hear the conversation between the two, otherwise, he would really feel that the brains of people in this era are indeed rich enough.       At this time, Leng Feng and Fluttershy are sitting in the bumpy carriage, and although the old horse is walking slowly, it is very steady under the guidance of the experienced Chai Bo.       Although Chai Bo was pushed to the ground by Zhou Tong and the three before, he did not suffer much damage. It's not that Zhou Tong knows how to respect the old and love the young, but Zhou informed that he can't cause a big mess in this situation. Their original intention was to flirt with women from good families, and at the same time, they were also preparing to blackmail Leng Feng for a sum of money, after all, this was their usual trick.       But unexpectedly, the final result was beyond their expectations.       "Young Master, you are really amazing!"       At this time, Leng Feng was lying in the car, and he bragged about the selection test process. The little girl who had never seen much of the world was stunned, and there were little stars flashing in her eyes.       "Huh! Your young master is powerful, it's not a star, as long as this young master is powerful, how can there be other people's business! Leng Feng continued to stink.       All the way, Leng Feng brags and Fluttershy is blindly adoring. Perhaps, in this world, only Fluttershy will not doubt Leng Feng's words. Although Leng Feng used to be cunning and his sisters could tease her, he was very good to Fluttershy and never treated her as a girl.       Fluttershy is also obedient to Leng Feng's words, and never suspects that Leng Feng will lie to her.       The sunset slowly set, stretching the shadow of the old carriage longer and longer, and bursts of laughter came from time to time. Chai Bo, who was driving the car, heard the laughter in the car, and the old man couldn't help but show a happy smile on his face.       As the most loyal housekeeper in the Leng Mansion, Chai Bo has no children and no daughters all his life, and Leng Feng's father and son have grown up under his watch. In the old man's heart, Leng Feng's father and son are his heirs. Now he feels that Leng Feng has really grown up, not only because Leng Feng won the top spot in this selection test, but also because he sees something different from Leng Feng in the past.       That is, Leng Feng has become responsible, and there is more human touch.       In this way, with a soft laugh, the carriage drove into the courtyard of the Leng family's house in the countryside.       "Madame, great joy!"       As soon as Chai Bo stopped the carriage, he called out to the women who were in front of the door.       It turned out that the women of Leng Feng's family were already waiting outside the door. Although they have not been to Linjiang City today, they have been thinking about it in their hearts.       "Is it that the young master has gained fame!" Erniang, who has always been straightforward, asked.       "Come on!" Chai Bo laughed.       "Great, once the young master has a meritorious reputation, many things will be easy to do!" Another aunt said.       This time, Leng Feng's mother was not surprised, she knew very well how much weight she gave away this time.After all, as a person who has taken care of the family business with Leng Da Cai, he still has a little knowledge. If these things are sent out, Leng Feng can't get a fame, then it can only show that the people of this era are too upright.       However, in the current environment, almost all upright people have been swept into the dust of history.       "Madam, the young master has won the top spot this time!"       At this time, Leng Feng and Fluttershy also get out of the carriage, and the little girl can't hide her words, and immediately reveals her old bottom.       "What, top of the list!"       Now Leng Feng's mother is not calm, if Leng Feng just got an ordinary fame, she can still hold back and not be surprised, but this top spot is too amazing. Even if Leng Li always thought that her son was very good, no matter how confident she was, she didn't think that Leng Feng could become one of the ten Face Sages, let alone the top of the list!       "Hehe, the young master is indeed at the top of the list!" Fluttershy smiles at Madame's shocked look.       In her opinion, the surprised appearance of Madame and the others was really funny. Like those people in Linjiang City, the reaction after hearing that the young master became the top of the list was too exaggerated.       Didn't the young master just get the top spot? And it's only the top of the list of Linjiang City, what is there to be so surprised! According to the young master's words, it is normal for him to win the top prize.       It seems that Leng Feng blew loudly enough along the way, and the little girl was brainwashed by him.       "I've seen my mother and aunts!" Leng Feng bowed and said.       "Feng'er, is what Fluttershy said true?" Leng Li asked eagerly.       "What's the point of worrying, I won it accidentally!" Leng Feng smiled.       "Sure enough, my son has a great talent! God bless, now my son finally has a chance! When Leng Li heard Leng Feng admit it in person, he became emotional, and his eyes immediately rippled with tears.       Now I don't know how to fix Leng Feng, how can I cry again! Although he knows the truth of crying with joy, he really can't stand the feeling of women crying at every turn in this era.       Of course, the main reason is that his soul is not the original inhabitants of this body. Although there are sequelae of time travel, and the memories of the original owner are also affecting him, it is still his own soul that plays a leading role.       Although this is a bit awkward, the meaning is actually obvious, that is, he still treats everything around him as an outsider.       So, tonight's Leng family house was very lively, and the surrounding villagers were also alarmed. They were equally happy to learn that Leng Feng had topped the list in today's selection test.       All of a sudden, Leng Feng's home received two chickens from this family and a basket of eggs from that family. After a while, there were a lot of rural specialties piled up in the yard of Leng Feng's house, and there were even a lot of wild meat from the villagers.       Leng Feng's family is the largest landlord in Hongshan Village, and more than 70 percent of the land here belongs to the Leng family. When Leng Feng's father bought this land, he didn't think about making money from it.Therefore, the tenants of the Leng family may be the luckiest tenants in the entire Southern Song Dynasty, and they only need to symbolically pay the intersection rent. In the event of a bad year, their rent will be waived.       Even after Leng Feng's family returned to the countryside from the city, they didn't change much. Therefore, this is also the reason why Leng Feng's family has been in a recession in the past two years. In fact, just with thousands of acres of land, you can live a rich life as a big landlord in the countryside.       In this era, most of the people are still very simple, and they naturally remember the good of the Leng family, and they also took the initiative to ask for an increase in rent. However, in the past two years, there have been many natural disasters, and the harvest is not good, and they are also powerless, and the harvest has become a problem even to maintain their own food and clothing.       Therefore, this construction to increase the rent was rejected by Leng Lee.       Leng Feng's father once told Leng Li that even if they returned to the countryside one day, the tenant rent here would never change.       However, although the Leng family did not collect the rent of these tenants, the tax per mu of the imperial court still had to be levied. And over the years, it has been almost higher than a year, which is also the real reason why many tenants can't open the pot.       In addition to the tax per acre, there is also a poll tax and forced labor, coupled with the compulsory conscription of the imperial court, even the residents of Hongshan Village are struggling with life and death.       Don't underestimate the chickens, ducks, fish and meat sent by these villagers, maybe those one or two chickens are the living capital of the family for a few months.       It can be seen that the villagers of Hongshan Village are still good to the Leng family.       That night, the Leng family's house was very lively, and it was celebrated until the second half of the night. This is the most lively time since moving to the countryside for two years for everyone in the Leng family!       However, as the protagonist of this matter, Leng Feng did not persist to the end and quit halfway.       Although most of the people in the Leng family's house at this time were women, they also drank a lot of alcohol. Maybe it's because everyone's life has been too depressing in the past two years, and now it's hard to wait for the day when Leng Feng raises his eyebrows. So Leng Feng's mother and several aunts were dizzy from drinking, and no one cared what Leng Feng was doing anymore.       There are two reasons why Leng Feng quit halfway, one is that as the only male in the family, and he is a junior, he feels very uncomfortable on this occasion. Another reason is that the drinks of this era are very unappetizing, not only low in content, but also have a bitter feeling.       At this time, Leng Feng was standing in front of a wooden box in his room in a daze, this wooden box looked a little old, but the workmanship and pulp were very good, it looked simple and generous, and there was no damage.       The wooden box had not been opened in the room for several years, and it had been brought with it when it had been moved from Linjiang City.       Now that Leng Feng has been reborn, he feels that this box is a bit of an eyesore and wants to clean it up. At the same time, you can free up a lot of room and do what you want.       After opening the box, a faint musty smell spread. However, because this box is made of sandalwood, there is absolutely nothing to say about antiseptic and insect protection, and the contents are very well preserved.       Most of these are some of the items that Leng Feng had collected before, and after seeing these items, Leng Feng couldn't help but pout, it seems that the original owner of this body really has a bad taste. As the son of the richest man in Linjiang City, although the items collected are some strange things, most of them are not worth much.       For example, there are a lot of puppets here. Although the production is beautiful and realistic, it is not worth much money in this era. There are even sachet embroidery bags, I don't know why Leng Feng collected these things back then.Through the memories of the original owner, Leng Feng found that this guy liked to collect this kind of items when he was a child, and he was even cheated out of a lot of money because of this. This wooden box is Leng Dashao's trophy, and it is also specially used to store these treasures.       Back then, Leng Dashao was not as sloppy as he was later, and he was even more naïve, so he loved to collect these items. Just like the teenagers in modern society who like to collect two-dimensional dolls.       These things are of no use to Leng Feng now, he is not the previous Leng Dashao, and he will not put these things in the room to get in the way.       As the former king of special forces, Leng Feng is accustomed to a simple life, and these useless things in the room are ready to be cleaned out. In this way, he will be able to free up a large space, which will not only facilitate his practice, but also facilitate some tinkering.       After all, it was only the force value of the little overlord Zhou Tong before, and it was not something he could deal with, and if he didn't make a little self-defense, he was really a little uneasy in this era.       Leng Feng also knew that he had won the top spot this time, and he must have invisibly stimulated the nerves of some people, which had to beware of someone secretly attacking him.       Just as Leng Feng was about to close the box and move it outside the door, he suddenly noticed that there seemed to be several yellowed books at the bottom of the box.       Although it was only a glance, the name of the top book was already in sight.       Eighteen palms of the dragon!       "Wow!"       Leng Feng couldn't help but smack his mouth, the title of this book is really enough to bluff.       Leng Feng remembers the origin of these books very clearly, because this incident is very impressive to him, and it is a shame in his life.       I remember that when Leng Dashao was eight years old, that period was the period of Leng Feng's transformation from a naïve child to a gentlemanly teenager.       At that time, it was also a special period, and there was a large-scale war between the imperial court and the north, and even Linjiang City also had a feeling of chaos. Although the Leng family had become the richest man in Linjiang City at that time, their business was also affected, and Leng Feng's father was very busy during that time and often did not touch the family.       At that time, Leng Feng was also without his father's discipline, coupled with the unstable situation, and the fish and dragons in Linjiang City were mixed, so he slowly learned badly.       One day, Leng Feng grabbed a handful of silver from the store, a string of sugar gourds in his left hand, and a big chicken leg in his right hand were wandering around the street. I met an old beggar with gray hair, beard and eyebrows, but although the old beggar was in tatters, he did not look sloppy.       "Ouch! I'm starving, I haven't eaten in three days! ”
       As soon as the beggar saw Leng Feng's middle chicken leg, his eyes immediately lit up, and he covered his stomach with his hand and screamed. After Leng Feng paused for a moment, he suddenly felt that this old beggar was so pitiful. He looked at the big shiny chicken leg in his hand, and gave the chicken leg to the old beggar.       The old beggar quickly took the chicken leg and stuffed it into his mouth eagerly. A full bite down, the corners of the mouth glow with oil. Leng Feng looked at the old beggar's fragrant appearance, and couldn't help swallowing his saliva, only then did he feel that the chicken legs were really fragrant."Child, I see that your bones are strange, and you are a one-in-a-million martial arts wizard, so this martial arts secret book will be given to you. In the future, the task of upholding justice and eliminating violence and peace will be entrusted to you! ”
       Eight-year-old Leng Feng took the cheats handed over by the old beggar with a confused face, and found that the book only had a few thin sheets of paper, and some villains were drawn with simple lines on the paper. These villains are in strange postures and are not beautiful at all, so Leng Feng has no interest in them.       The cover of the cheats has only five words: Eighteen Palms of the Descending Dragon.       When he looked up again, he saw that the old beggar was gone.       Leng Feng didn't take this seriously at the time, thinking that the old beggar was coaxing his chicken legs, so he casually threw the thin book on the side of the road.       After that, Leng Feng continued to wander the street, only to meet Zhou Tong bullying a little girl. Although Leng Dashao was still very young at that time, he also knew that bullying the weak was not a real hero, so he stepped forward and yelled: "Stop, let go of that girl!" ”
       As a result, he was severely beaten by the little overlord Zhou Tong.       Although the rich man Leng found a place for him later, and the little overlord Zhou Tong was also cleaned up fiercely, the impact on him was still quite big. Therefore, Leng Feng's ability to become a gentleman also has a lot to do with this incident back then.       The young Leng Da Shao ran home with a pair of panda eyes, crying and snorting snot to call his parents. Just as he was running around a corner of the street, a shocking thunderclap suddenly sounded in the clear sky, startling him.       Under his feet, the ground seemed to shake, and Leng Feng, who was running, tripped over something and fell. Leng Feng got up and found that he had tripped over one of his packages. The package was small, but it looked sturdy, and there were things in it.       Leng Feng was very angry, he was beaten by Zhou Tong before, he was just frightened by thunder, and now he was tripped by this inconspicuous package. So he kicked the package hard, and the package rolled to the side of the road by him, and Leng Feng also held his foot and screamed and jumped.       It turned out that the contents of the package were very hard, and his feet were kicked very painfully.       Leng Feng's curiosity was piqued, and he jumped to his feet and walked over to the package, only to find that the package happened to land on top of the book he had thrown away earlier.       Leng Feng ignored the book, but directly opened the package, which turned out to be still a book inside. However, in addition to the three books, there are also a few puppet figures.       Seeing the contents inside, Leng Feng had no interest in the books, but just glanced at them lightly. The titles of the three books are the Nine Yin True Scripture, the Innate Divine Skill, and the Wu Mu Testament, and Leng Feng had no concept of this thing at that time, so he was very interested in those little wooden people.       At that time, Leng Feng liked to collect puppets, and these little wooden figures happened to be in his favorite, so he took the package in his hand and prepared to take it home. I don't know what kind of psychology it is, Leng Feng picked up the book on the ground and put it in the package.       Leng Feng was only eight years old at the time, and he didn't know what the value of these things was. In his eyes, only those few little puppets were not bad, and as for those books, he didn't even bother to read the names.       Leng Feng's love for dolls was only a whim, and after a while, he was no longer interested in these things. Soon after, all of his beloved things were locked in this wooden box.       If it weren't for Leng Feng today in order to clean up the room and make room for him to make some things, he really wouldn't have thought about it.Leng Feng was young and ignorant, and he didn't take these things to heart at all. But as a person who has traveled through the 21st century, Leng Feng is still very interested in some legends of this era.       Some martial arts novels in the 21st century portray this era as a period of high martial arts, and many martial arts novels are set in this era.       Although in the memory of the original owner, there was no content related to martial arts masters, Leng Feng also knew that no matter what era it was, ordinary people could not come into contact with some special secrets. Even in the 21st century, when the Internet is highly developed, ordinary people don't know that there are people like them.       Real special forces, especially soldiers at the level of Leng Feng, are almost impossible for ordinary people to touch, and even if they do, they don't know their true identities. As for the scenes described in the relevant film and television works, they are just the tip of the iceberg.       And as the captain of the special combat team, at this level, Leng Feng also knows some unknown secrets. Even in the 21st century, there is a group of mysterious people whose abilities far exceed those of ordinary people, and who also live in circles that ordinary people cannot reach.       The previous Leng Dashao didn't know this, but Leng Feng was different. There was a faint expectation in his heart, thinking that the old beggar who ate his chicken legs that Leng Dashao met back then, and the package he inadvertently picked up, might be extraordinary.       At this time, Leng Feng's breathing became short, even he had always been calm, and he was extremely looking forward to it in his heart, and even his hands trembled slightly. If it is really as he guessed, then these things can definitely make the entire rivers and lakes set off a bloody storm.       Due to the special historical environment in which they were located back then, many masters who were not familiar to the world gathered in Linjiang City and launched a great war.       The thunderous sound that Leng Feng heard back then was not really natural thunder and lightning, but a movement from the collision of masters.       That old beggar is very likely to be a legendary master, and the reason why he gave Leng Feng the martial arts cheats is that this old beggar feels that this battle is full of dangers, and he may not be able to get out of the way. In order to leave a legacy, he hurriedly gave the secret that was not passed on to Leng Feng.       Perhaps as the old beggar said, Leng Feng is a martial arts wizard. Or these real masters have strange personalities, and in this case, they met Leng Feng, and ate one of his chicken legs, thinking that this was destined fate.       In short, this is Leng Dashao's adventure. But it's a pity that Leng Dashao didn't grasp such a good opportunity, and all made wedding dresses for Leng Feng.       Picking up the thin book at the top, the first thing I felt was that the material of this book was extraordinary, not made of paper, but of a special animal leather.       Eighteen palms of the dragon!       These quaint characters written in seal script seem to have a special charm, giving people an extremely strong and domineering feeling. Just the big words on these covers made his heart surge, and the blood flow involuntarily sped up a little.       Leng Feng stretched out his hand to open the booklet, there were a total of nine sheets of paper, each of which had a villain drawn on it. The movements of these villains are different, and there are small dots on top of the villain's body, and the dots are connected by different lines.       When Leng Feng saw these portraits of villains, especially the dots and lines on the villain's body, there was an inexplicable air flow in his body.       A surging force seems to be about to recover!       But Leng Feng had a hunch that if he allowed this force to grow, he wouldn't be able to control it at all now. It's like using a bottle of water, which is the capacity of a bottle, and if you have to fill it with a bucket of water, the bottle will burst."Whew!"       He closed his eyes and let out a long breath, forcibly interrupting the feeling. Although there are only five words on the cover, it can be seen that the skill of the writer of these five words is extraordinary, and there is an artistic conception that is integrated into it, just by looking at these words, you can feel something.       Sure enough, this was the same as he guessed, what the old beggar gave Leng Dashao back then was indeed a genuine martial arts cheatbook.       However, this cheats book is not complete, only the first half. If Leng Feng didn't guess wrong, this cheatbook should have eighteen pages, recording a move on each side.       This is the famous eighteen palms of the dragon descending, but unfortunately there are only the first nine styles.       Turning the cover, the villain on the first page has his left leg slightly bent, his right arm bent inward, and his right palm is pushed outward in a circle. Although it is a static image, it looks like it is alive when you look at it.       Kanglong has regrets, and the first type of eighteen palms of the dragon is lowered.       There is also a line of small characters under it: Yang Qi is concentrated in the Du Mai, Qi enters the dantian, Tong Chang Qiang, walks around the waist Yu Yang Guan, the life gate hangs in the pivot spine, the central tendon shrinks to the Yang Ling Terrace, the Shendao body pillar Tao Dao spine, the dumb door Fengfu brain Hu Qiang between the back top hundred will be before the top will be on the star, the Shenting Su Ji water ditch is exchanged with the end of the gums, the hand Taiyin lung is passed to the Zhongfu Yunmen Tianfu, and the white ruler Zekong is the most missing meridian to the palm.       The image of the villain and the mantra of the fortune are concise and clear, and a painting plus dozens of words is the essence of the first style of the eighteen palms of the dragon.       As the saying goes, if you really pass on a sentence, you will spread ten thousand books falsely. The more subtle the thing, the simpler it is.       The next eight pages are the same, they are all concise and clear, and even Leng Feng, a traverser, can understand it.       Holding back the surging mood, Leng Feng continued to flip through several other books, and the expectation in his heart rose a lot again. After all, this half of the book brought him a great surprise, so the remaining few complete books must not be far behind.       There are three other books below, especially the two above, which look even more primitive than this half of the Eighteen Palms of the Dragon Descending.       When he saw the name on the book, Leng Feng couldn't hold back the excitement at this time.       "Nine Yin True Scripture, Innate Divine Skill, Wu Mu's Testament! It turned out to be these three strange books, and now they are developed! Leng Feng couldn't help but clench his fists and muttered to himself.       Although he didn't open the books, Leng Feng could be sure that these three books were true, especially the Nine Yin True Scripture and the Innate Divine Skill, these two books exuded an inexplicable charm, and they were not weaker than the half of the Dragon Descending Eighteen Palms.       According to the novels that Leng Feng had read in his previous life, the Nine Yin True Scripture was born in this era. Because the true scripture contains the methods to crack the martial arts of various major schools, and it is the general outline of martial arts in the world, it has caused a competition among the heroes of the rivers and lakes and set off a bloody storm. When Leng Feng saw these contents, he was still an eleven or twelve-year-old boy, and he couldn't help but feel emotionally surging in his heart.       Unexpectedly, now he is going to be the protagonist of the book.If this book is really the Nine Yin True Scripture, then its value is far more than that half of the Dragon Descending Eighteen Palms. However, the Nine Yin True Scripture is divided into two volumes, and Leng Feng only has one here. It seems that like the Eighteen Palms of the Dragon Descending, he has only obtained half of this mastery.       Sure enough, Leng Feng saw a small word "Shang" under the four big characters of the Nine Yin True Scripture.       The upper and lower volumes of the Nine Yin True Scripture record different martial arts, the upper volume is internal strength, and the lower volume is the moves.       "The way of heaven is to make up for the deficiency when there is more than what is lost, so the void is better than the real, and the lack is more than enough. Its meaning, its mystery, its interest is profound. The image of heaven and earth, the column of yin and yang, the cause of change, the sign of death and life......"       As soon as Leng Feng saw the opening paragraph, he immediately felt a sense of alarm, so he immediately closed the book. Like the half of the Eighteen Palms of the Dragon Descending, with his current level, he is not suitable for this kind of divine skill.       If you can't understand anything, it doesn't matter, it won't affect you. If you can fully understand the integration, there will be no problem. The most afraid is that Leng Feng is like this now, he can see whether he understands or not, and the qi in his body will automatically follow.       Leng Feng didn't know if he could be regarded as a martial arts wizard like this, with such a profound martial arts cheat, he could react at a glance at his body. However, whether he is a martial arts wizard or not, he can only watch but not practice now.       What's more, his current physical fitness is extremely poor, the meridians in his body are blocked, and his qi energy cannot run smoothly at all. In such a situation, the energy generated in the body is equivalent to igniting gunpowder in a confined space, which will blow you up.       However, even the first volume of the Nine Yin True Scripture is broad and profound, containing several supreme learnings. For Leng Feng, he was already content. As for the chance in the future, I'll see if I can get the next volume.       Leng Feng doesn't know if there is also a Huashan sword in this era, if so, I will take a look later. It is said that Huashan Lunjian is full of masters, and the original intention of Huashan Lunjian was also to determine the ownership of the Nine Yin True Scripture.       Of course, that's all for later. You have to wait until Leng Feng has learned these things thoroughly before you can go.       The second book is Innate Shengong, which is a Taoist practice of breathing and breathing. Leng Feng could feel that the artistic conception of this book was very peaceful, and there was no adverse impact on him.       The content of the cold front can be understood, this skill is a unique Taoist secret, in order to dispel all kinds of diseases, adjust the void and reality, and treat heavy internal injuries.       If you want to practice this skill, your body is like a virgin, not moving like a mountain, and moving like a rabbit. When the limit is reached, the touch can be silent, the dark energy in the air is crossing, the wind is excited, and the mysteries in the exercises can make people's potential consciousness be stimulated to the limit, and martial arts will enter the unfathomable realm.       This is exactly where the cold front comes in. And there is another benefit of innate divine skills, as long as the cultivation is introduced, it is a long-term accumulation process, that is, you can practice while sleeping. And this exercise can be attached to all martial arts, it is really a nanny-level divine skill.       The so-called innate divine power is the meaning of turning the acquired into an innate one, which will constantly purify the body, and eventually reach the realm of no leakage and no pollution, and become a fairy-like existence.       The third book is of little use to the current Leng Feng, and Wu Mu's suicide note was left by Yue Fei, most of which are battle formations in the art of war. Among them, the most precious is the back hand left by Yue Wumu, although Yue Wumu is loyal to the imperial court, but he is not stupid, knowing that there are people in the imperial court who want to be unfavorable to him.So, before he was recruited back by more than a dozen gold medals, he had already hidden some forces under his command and secretly developed. In order to one day, he can rely on Wu Mu's suicide note to gather the old department and clean up the old rivers and mountains again.       Therefore, no matter what era it is, Leng Feng admires people like Yue Wumu very much. But it's a pity that when Yue Wu Musheng didn't sew, he didn't meet Mingjun.       After sorting out his mood, Leng Feng solemnly put aside the three and a half books.       His gaze fell on a puppet figure, and his gaze lit up again, even more shocked than the books he had posted before.       Thinking of the package that Leng Dashao picked up at the beginning, Leng Feng had guessed before that the little puppet who could be put together with these three strange books would never be simple. Now seeing this puppet villain, Leng Feng's emotions finally couldn't hold back.       So, Leng Feng continued to search in the wooden box, and soon he found nine different little puppeteers among the many objects. The posture of these little puppets is very peculiar, and in the eyes of normal people, they are beyond the scope of common sense.       Leng Dashao before might just think that these little puppet villains were a little interesting, but after Leng Feng saw these nine puppet villains, the expression on his face was extremely exciting. Because of these nine puppet villains, the shape of two of them is exactly what Leng Feng's family forging technique looks like.       Although the other seven were different from the body forging techniques that Leng Feng knew, he could see at a glance that they were definitely from the same source.       After seeing these nine puppet villains, Leng Feng realized that his family forging technique was incomplete. Now Leng Feng finally understood why in his family records, after no one was able to practice the body forging technique to the third level, it turned out that these strange puppet villains were missing.       After taking these nine puppet villains in his hand and studying them carefully, Leng Feng finally understood that the body forging technique inherited by the Leng family was only some external forms, lacking the key charm and the internal exercise route.       It turned out that their family's body forging technique was not as simple as a few pure movements, but a very advanced cultivation method, and what their Leng family inherited was only the skin.       Some of the nine puppets are carved with some intricate patterns, and some are written records.       The twelve heavenly gods and demons forge their bodies!       At this time, Leng Feng knew that his family body forging technique was originally this name.       It is said that this set of body forging magic skills has a long history and is very mysterious, and cultivators can not only develop their own potential, but also through the operation of the exercises, they can carve runes on their bodies, and have the ability of the ancient twelve ancestors to pass through the heavens and latitudes. When all the twelve methods are cultivated, you can go to heaven and earth and travel through time and space.       Of course, this is the information that Leng Feng got from the nine puppet figures, but there were originally twelve of them, and now there are only nine here. In other words, in order to verify the authenticity, whether it can reach that level, the other three must be found.       However, in Leng Feng's view, this statement may have an element of bragging.These nine puppet villains are still different from Leng Feng's family forging skills, and each little puppet villain does not represent a level of exercise.       The Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Body Divine Skills, this set of exercises is indeed divided into nine layers. And these nine puppet figures represent a magical ability, that is, it is equivalent to a kind of exercise, and each exercise is also divided into nine levels.       Moreover, there are special requirements for cultivating each kind of exercise, and it is very difficult to succeed in cultivation, and the conditions are very demanding. For example, if you want to cultivate the divine water technique of co-working, then you need the majestic power of water, and you can only cultivate it if you are located in a place with abundant water sources. Even better, you can find the essence of water, and after absorbing it, you can save years of penance.       However, with these puppet villains, Leng Feng can practice the complete body forging technique. For the current body, the effect of the Body Forging Technique is definitely the best.       Cultivating innate skills internally and forging body skills externally, I believe that before long, Leng Feng will be able to temper his body to a height beyond his previous life. At that time, he would be able to cultivate the Eighteen Palms of the Dragon Descending Sect, as well as the martial arts on the Nine Yin True Scripture.       At this moment, Leng Feng's heart can be regarded as truly balanced. Others have golden fingers when they cross, but he himself crosses into the waste wood, and he gets nothing except being in danger.       Now that this treasure has been discovered, I finally feel the superiority of being a reborn person. It seems that he can be reborn into this era, there is some kind of certainty in the dark, otherwise he can't explain why he crossed into this era, and he coincidentally crossed over to Leng Dashao's body.       These things were all obtained by Leng Dashao when he was eight years old, but after he got these things, he didn't find out the secret of these things at all, and just threw them here as rags.       "It seems that these opportunities are waiting for them, and they are their real masters!" Leng Feng seemed to have a kind of realization in his heart, and he had some thoughts about why he came to this world.       After calming down, Leng Feng rummaged through the wooden box again. In fact, at this time, he had a fluke mentality, after all, he found so many good things in this wooden box, if there were other good things that were missed, wouldn't it be a big loss!       However, after these things were handled by him one by one, he found that except for these few things, they were all useless things.       Then Leng Feng put the four books and the nine small puppeteers aside, and as for the other things in the box, they all packed up and put them in another ordinary wooden box. At this time, Leng Feng changed his original intention and did not throw away these things, after all, he got these good things, which is equivalent to owing Leng Dashao a favor, leaving these things, even if it is a commemoration of the late Leng Dashao!       And this wooden box is really well made, and can continue to be used to store some items.       Half an hour had passed since Leng Feng came back from the front yard, and he could still hear the faint laughter coming from the front yard. Leng Feng also smiled, pushed open the window and felt the April air blowing? Wind.       At this time, Leng Feng felt that this era was not bad, at least he already had the foundation to gain a foothold in this era. Raising his eyes to look at the not-so-bright moon outside the window, Leng Feng picked up a puppet and placed it on the windowsill.       The moonlight shone through the window on the people in the room, and the figure was very strange.Leng Feng's body took on a strange shape again, and this time Leng Feng could clearly feel that this time the body forging technique was much smoother than when he practiced in the morning. At the same time, his body trembled rhythmically, and the muscles under his skin were also wriggling, as if some invisible insects were crawling inside.       This is the wonder of the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demon Forging Techniques, which are far from comparable to the forging techniques inherited by the Leng family in the previous life.       If in his previous life, Leng Feng's family body forging technique was just a broadcast exercise, then the current Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demon Body Forging Divine Skills are equivalent to the eighteen palms of the dragon descending.       At this time, Leng Feng also completely understood, although the realm division of the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demon Body Forging Divine Skill was also nine layers, it was more complicated than his original family body forging technique.       And these nine levels are only used to lay the foundation, and each level has different actions. In conjunction with the specific exercise route, the qi and blood are driven by the shaking of the body's muscles and meridians, so as to form an external training of muscles, bones, skin, and internal training, and the internal and external training will train the body functions to new heights one after another.       In the end, the body is polished into the body of gods and demons. After reaching a certain level, you can cultivate the innate skills of the twelve heavenly gods and demons.       However, it is not easy to cultivate the innate skills of the twelve heavenly gods and demons, and it has to cooperate with many external conditions. To truly cultivate, it is not only a matter of talent and perseverance, but also under a specific environment.       However, those cold fronts are still too far from the current ones. With his current situation, if he wants to cultivate the nine levels of the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demon Forging Divine Skills to the highest level, he still doesn't know that it is the Year of the Monkey.       Great oaks from little acorns grow.! Doing a good job in front of you first is the first priority. Leng Feng has never been a dreamer, so from now on, he will use it to practice whenever he has time.       In less than a pillar of incense, Leng Feng was sweating profusely again, and he fell to the ground like a dead dog. This time, the workout was once again out of the load of the body, and once again exceeded the limit, and the first movement was still barely completed by less than a third.       Compared to the results of this morning's workout, the improvement is obvious. However, the feeling for the cold front is obviously different from this morning.       Everything has a hard time at the beginning, and the same is true for practice. Once a certain habit is formed, a kind of inertia will be formed in the long run, and the cold front in the previous life has a deep understanding of this aspect.       So, everything has to start from scratch.       Fortunately, Leng Feng has never lacked perseverance and patience, although he has only started to practice martial arts at this time, and his age is indeed a little older, but the body forging magic skill can make up for the shortcomings in this regard. As long as perseverance can keep up, nothing is a problem.       After lying on the ground, Leng Feng felt that his body didn't seem to be his own, and it was difficult to move a finger. However, he could feel that every cell in himself had become different, and it seemed that some kind of metamorphosis was underway.       There was also an invisible electric current surging, and the whole body felt sour and numb. This feeling is different from the feeling of relief after the first workout this morning, it is painful and happy.That feeling in my body this morning came and went as fast as I could, and there was hardly any force left in my body. But at this time, Leng Feng could clearly feel that the newly born strength slowly accumulated in his body after he traveled around his body a few times. As long as his mind moves, the power accumulated in every inch of muscle and bone can be mobilized by him at will.       The Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Body Divine Skill is different from the martial arts of the world, the energy he produces is very special, and it is not gathered in the Qi Sea Dantian, but dispersed to every part of the body. And these forces are not only as simple as staying in the body, but also tempering the body all the time.       This is the magic of the true Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons forging body power.       After a pillar of incense, Leng Feng got up from the ground, feeling sticky all over his body, and smelling a sour smell.       "Fluttershy!"       Leng Feng shouted outside the courtyard, he wanted to get some hot water to come over and take a bath. After all, the conditions in this era are too simple, and it is a luxury to get some hot water for a bath.       Hot water had to be boiled and used, and there were no insulation facilities in this era. And for the pot stove in this era, to be honest, Leng Feng really doesn't know how to use it.       Although it was April, the weather was still very cool at night, and the water was taken from the deep well. In this season, bathing in cold water is still very sour, at least Leng Feng does not have this masochistic tendency.       Although with his current physique, bathing in cold water would not be much of a problem. But this sour substance on his body was oily and greasy, and his hands were slimy to the touch, and it was difficult to wash off with cold water without shower gel and soap.       "Young Master—here!"       As soon as Leng Feng's words end, Fluttershy's voice comes from outside the courtyard.       It turned out that after this little girl saw Leng Feng coming back, she also hurriedly ate a few bites of food and ran back. However, she did not enter Leng Feng's courtyard, but played outside with a few little sisters.       "Ahh Young master, you've fallen into the manure pit! ”
       As soon as Fluttershy enters, Fluttershy clutches her nose and screams.       "Ahh My brother stinks! ”
       Unexpectedly, the little sisters run in after Fluttershy, and they cover their cute little noses one by one.       Leng Feng: "......"       At this moment, Leng Feng realized something. He is used to the smell of abalone for a long time, but Fluttershy is different from these little sisters.       At this time, it is about ten o'clock in the evening. In fact, there are very few people in this era who haven't slept at this point in time, if it weren't for Leng Feng winning the top spot today, and the ladies in the Leng family compound were in a good mood and had a family banquet, these children would not have played so late.       In fact, Leng Feng still likes children very much, especially these cute little sisters. However, because of the Leng Dashao in his previous life, he bullied these little sisters a lot, so they were still a little afraid of Leng Feng.If it weren't for the fact that everyone in the family was happy because of Leng Feng today, and that Leng Feng seemed to give them a kinder feeling today, they wouldn't have dared to follow Fluttershy into Leng Feng's small courtyard.       "Come, cicadas! Brother has good things for you! Leng Feng said to a seven or eight-year-old girl.       This little girl is Leng Feng's own sister, and like Leng Feng, she was born to the eldest lady Leng Li. But although she is her own sister, Leng Dashao has not teased her less before. Therefore, Leng Chan'er can't say how close he is to Leng Feng.       Obviously, after hearing Leng Feng's words, the little cicada shrank back in fright. Before, because of the excitement, there was also a slight hint of horror on the red fluttering little face.       This is still his own sister, and when he saw Leng Feng, the reaction of several other little girls was even worse than Leng Chan'er, and some people even had tears rolling in their eyes. They thought that the "stinky brother" shouted by their few people before had angered Leng Feng, and Leng Feng was trying to clean them up.       If according to the previous Leng Dashao's virtue, there is really this possibility, no wonder these little girls are afraid of him. However, Leng Feng at this time did not mean this, but really had something to give to these little girls.       Seeing Leng Chan'er and other little sisters, this reminded Leng Feng of the "treasures" that he had just found out of the box before. Although those things are useless to themselves, they are the toys that Leng Chan'er and a few little girls like.       Giving these things to Leng Chan'er and others can be regarded as giving full play to the value of these things again, and also making up for some mistakes for Leng Dashao before.       But Leng Feng didn't expect that the reactions of these little girls, including his own sister Chan'er, would be so strong.       "Fluttershy, go get the bathwater hot!" Leng Feng had no choice but to arrange business first, and the sticky feeling on his body was really uncomfortable.       Fluttershy glances at Cold Front and immediately turns and runs out.       "Okay!"       In this era, most people rely on the weather to take a bath, and only some wealthy people will build a special bathing room at home. Moreover, the bathing rooms of this era are different from the era in which Leng Feng lived, most of them were wooden houses, and there was a stove in the house that could boil water. On the side of the stove there is a large wooden barrel in which water can be refilled at any time.       Leng Feng knew that there was such a bathroom in the courtyard of the Leng family's house, but he really didn't know how to get the stove inside.       After seeing Fluttershy run away, Leng Feng tries to make his face appear amiable. Facing the four little sisters who were about to disperse, he said, "Wait a minute! I really have something fun to give you. ”
       Originally, after seeing Fluttershy leave Leng Feng's place, the little sisters also wanted to leave, but they were stopped by Leng Feng. They know that Leng Dashao has a strange personality, sometimes it's okay for you to scold him, and sometimes you show favor to him and attract his teasing. Therefore, the little sister can't figure out Leng Dashao's routine, and the best way is to stay away from him.       However, Leng Feng ignored their reactions and pulled out a wooden box from the room. Inside this wooden box are the treasures that Leng Dashao collected, and now they have all been taken out by Leng Feng.       "These are the treasures I collected before, and now I give them to you, just take whatever you like!"       Leng Feng also knew that these little sisters were afraid of him, so after opening the box, he left with a smile. It's up to the little sisters to choose by themselves, and he will make these little sisters have some scruples here.       Seeing that Leng Feng really left, these little sisters looked at the boxes in front of them and walked up cautiously one by one. When they saw the contents of the box, they all had expressions of surprise on their faces.There are many things they have seen here, and Leng Dashao has not shown off these things in front of them before. The children of this era are very pitiful, there are no toys at all, and these things can be said to attract the attention of all children in this era.       The eldest of Leng Dashao's little sisters is seven or eight years old, and they are at the age when they are curious about everything.       Leng Chan'er took the lead in reaching into the wooden box, and a sachet was held in her hand. Then, the eyes of the others also lit up, and after a while, these treasures of Leng Dashao were divided by several little sisters.       Cold Front is already lying in the vat, and Fluttershy is driven out after boiling the water. He can accept Fluttershy wiping his body for him, but he can't accept bathing himself. Besides, even the previous Leng Dashao didn't let Fluttershy bathe herself.       In his previous and present lives, Leng Feng had never taken such a long bath, and even the bath water had been changed three times. When he came out of the shower, he never felt so refreshed.       Looking at his skin again, there is already a faint crystal texture, and some of the scars left on his body before are no longer visible.       These are all superficial phenomena, and the cold front can feel that the changes in the body are greater. The previous feeling of being powerless has disappeared, and there is a kind of power hidden in the body, and it feels like it is not a problem for me to be able to defeat a dozen ordinary people.       "Young Master, your face has turned white!"       Fluttershy stares at Leng Feng after taking a shower, as if she had discovered a new world.       "Huh! Take a bath more and it will naturally be white! Leng Feng smiled.       "Really!"       "Of course, if you don't believe it, you can try!"       Fluttershy touches her face, feeling that she is not as white as the young master's face, and says that she must try.       When Leng Feng returned to the gate of his small courtyard, he found Chan'er playing happily with her three sisters. When they saw Leng Feng, they couldn't help but stop what they were doing.       Leng Feng walked away with a smile, I don't know if it was because Leng Feng had just finished taking a shower, and he was exuding a special charm on his body. It was these toys that played a role, and this time the four sisters did not show any more fear, but all looked at him with big eyes.       "Chan'er, do you like these things?" Leng Feng walked over, touched Chan'er's head and said.       It's rare that Chan'er didn't dodge this time, but met Leng Feng's gaze and whispered: "I like it!" ”
       "Well, you're having fun here. But don't be too late, when Fluttershy comes over, you can go back to rest with her! ”
       Leng Feng played with a few sisters for a while, and then left, he knew the truth of overreach. The four little sisters had been afraid of him before, and now he wanted to change that. However, because it was too late, the little girl could not sleep too late at this age.       Seeing Leng Feng leaving, these younger sisters all showed happy smiles, and at this time they felt that it was a happy thing to have an older brother.After Leng Feng returned to the room, he could faintly hear the laughter of the mother and the three aunts in the front yard, and it seemed that they were going to be sleepless tonight. But Leng Feng doesn't care about this, they are happy to let them!       turned over to bed, but Leng Feng did not sleep, but sat cross-legged according to the requirements of the innate divine skill. Holding his breath and concentrating, silently reciting the mantra, Leng Feng's body slowly relaxed. It didn't take long for their breath to enter a state of seeming nothingness, implying some kind of strange rhythm.       At the same time, the mind is slowly empty, there is nothing else and no self, and the mind is empty. Innate Shengong is a Taoist cultivation method, which is secretly in line with the natural way of heaven and earth.       It's not like it, it's a wonderful state. It is a realm pursued by many masters of Buddhism and Taoism, but it can be seen that Leng Feng has reached this realm by cultivating innate divine skills for the first time, which is indeed extraordinary.       Of course, Leng Feng's situation is very special, unlike those true Buddha powers, he only temporarily entered this realm. Once this cultivation is over, if he wants to enter this realm again, it depends on whether there is a chance.       However, Leng Feng, who was in a state of concentration, didn't know, he only felt as if his body was soaked in warmth? In the liquid, even the soul is sublimated.       This is the so-called innate state of innate divine skills, but anyone who can enter the innate state when cultivating innate divine skills is a person with great opportunity. Especially if you practice for the first time, you will be able to enter the innate state, and your future achievements will be absolutely limitless.       Time passed slowly, the moon outside the window disappeared at some point, and the countryside finally returned to the silence he deserved. There was no noise in the Leng family's compound, and everyone fell asleep.       No one knew that in the early years of the Southern Song Dynasty, in an inconspicuous small village, there was a teenager whose body was undergoing some strange changes. The history of the Southern Song Dynasty will also be rewritten because of this teenager.       "Wow!"       Suddenly there was a long, long whistling sound from the distant sky, and I don't know what kind of bird of prey was calling.       "Brush!"       Leng Feng's eyes opened suddenly, and a bright light seemed to flash in the slightly dark space, but if he looked closely, his eyes were still the same, as if they were illusions that had never appeared.       "This is the innate skill, it is really magical!"       Leng Feng felt his state and felt better than ever. Sure enough, as described in the Innate Divine Skill, the time to enter the Innate Realm for a few breaths is equivalent to four hours of deep sleep. From the second half of the night, the cold front was in an innate state for two hours.       In these two hours, all the previous deficits in his body have been perfectly filled.       At this time, Leng Feng felt that his aura had become more vigorous, and there was a feeling of continuity, and his strength had more than doubled again. More importantly, Leng Feng could feel that his durability had become stronger.       The innate divine skill is not like the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demon Body Forging Technique, which can significantly increase the strength of the body, nor is it as domineering and strong as the Eighteen Palms of the Dragon Descending, and it does not have the strange and unpredictable changes and all-encompassing of the Nine Yin True Scripture. But there is one other exercise that has no merit, that is, it purifies the body and soul, makes people's breath and vitality more vigorous, and the stamina and recovery speed can reach a terrifying level.       If at this time, let him face the little bully Zhou Tong again, Leng Feng is confident that he will defeat him head-on.       However, Leng Feng never regarded him as an opponent, at most he was just an insignificant stumbling block on the way forward.Turning over and getting out of bed, Leng Feng simply cleaned up, then pushed open the door and breathed in the cool air. The air in this era is good, there is no industrial pollution that has passed through later generations, and the air has a hint of sweetness.       As a human born in the 21st century, that is, a traverser like Leng Feng, he can clearly feel the difference between the two types of air.       At this time, there was still a little time before dawn, and according to the routine of his previous life, Leng Feng just woke up at this time. It seems that the powerful inertia of his previous life has traveled with him, yesterday morning, and it is still the same today.       If it weren't for that, it would have been the cry of a bird of prey just now, which wouldn't have startled him at all.       "But what kind of raptor made that cry!" A thought flashed in Leng Feng's heart, he had the opportunity to go to Dongshan to have a look, there was an old mountain forest, dozens of kilometers long, and there were many birds and beasts. The voice I heard before came from that direction.       Capture the sky on the left, lead the yellow on the right!       What a majesty this is, Leng Feng in his previous life had this kind of dream. However, this wish could not be realized in the previous era, but it should not be a problem in this era.       "Run!"       The first thing he did after getting up, Leng Feng ran around the Leng family's compound just like yesterday. In fact, with the current cultivation method, running no longer has much meaning for Leng Feng, but this habit from the bones engraved in his previous life, he does not plan to change it now.       Not only is it a memorial to a past life, but it's also a great time to relax your mind and think about things while running.       After Leng Feng ran around the Leng family's compound for more than 20 laps, he felt a little tired, and the speed at this time was far from comparable to yesterday. It seems that yesterday's cultivation of the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Divine Skill and Innate Divine Skill was indeed quite a big change in his physical fitness.       After running for another ten laps, Leng Feng had a feeling of being out of breath.       At this time, there is a faint light on the horizon, and the sun will rise from there before long. Leng Feng paused and adjusted his breathing for a while, then returned to his small courtyard and began to practice the body forging technique.       Since everyone slept late last night, Leng Feng was active alone in the Leng family's compound at this time. It wasn't until Leng Feng posed facing the place where the sun was about to rise that he felt Fluttershy's head poke out of the courtyard, and then the girl turned and ran away.       Leng Feng ignores Fluttershy, he knows that this is the girl's habit, and now he must be busy with other things.       This time, Leng Feng still didn't last until a stick of incense, and he was tired again. But compared to yesterday, the performance is not so unbearable, and there is only a layer of sweat on the body, and there is no sticky smell.       Leng Feng could feel his body strengthen again, but compared to yesterday, this change was much weaker. Leng Feng can also understand this situation, knowing that martial arts training is a step-by-step process. Progress is most noticeable at the beginning, and once you get started, you have to practice diligently.       However, as long as there can be progress, it will be meaningful for Leng Feng.       It wasn't until the sun fully rose that the Leng family's compound became lively again. Those who slept late last night all got up one after another, and there was a smell of fireworks in the world between the chickens and the chickens.Leng Li came and walked towards Leng Feng's small courtyard, although they slept late yesterday, they didn't really drink much, and most of the time they were chatting.       "Feng'er, when did you get up?"       When Leng Li saw Leng Feng, he had already changed his clothes and cleaned himself up.       "I've seen my mother! The child has just gotten up! Leng Feng hurriedly returned the salute, but he didn't tell the truth, mainly because he was afraid that the contrast between himself and Leng Dashao before would be too big and cause some unnecessary trouble.       In fact, he is very unaccustomed to some etiquette of this era, but when he was born in this era, he must follow the customs of the locals. And Leng Feng was also more or less affected by the memory of the original owner of this body, although Leng Dashao was very filial, but he was very filial, and he was even more respectful to Leng Li.       "Feng'er has really grown up! How happy it would be if the master was still there! ”
       Leng Li looked at Leng Feng and said, his eyes red again between these words. Leng Feng couldn't see this situation the most, he quickly changed the topic and said, "Mother, I have to go to the city today." ”
       "Yes, my mother almost forgot about it! I'm definitely going to the school and the master of the school today, and I've prepared a thank you gift, but I have to thank the mountain chief and them. ”
       Leng Feng's trick really worked, and Leng Li immediately stopped his mood swings.       Although she also knew that Leng Feng was able to win the top spot this time, and it had nothing to do with the help of her Tuoshan Chang and others, but this should still be courteous. This is where Leng Li's insight exceeds that of ordinary people, as the richest wife in Linjiang City, this insight is still there.       As she speaks, Fluttershy walks in, but the girl wakes up early. When Leng Feng began to practice the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Divine Skill, she had already been to Leng Feng's courtyard once. However, seeing that Leng Feng was practicing, he didn't bother, and turned around to go to other things.       Of course, Leng Feng knew that Fluttershy was here, but with his current state, he couldn't be distracted while practicing, so he didn't say hello to Fluttershy.       Last night, the Leng family compound was very lively, but after the excitement, there were many things left behind that were not cleaned up. Fluttershy has always been a hardworking little bee in the house, and if she hadn't gone to bed with her little sisters last night, she wouldn't have waited until this morning to clean up.       As for the aunts at home, they have just woken up at this time. After all, she drank alcohol last night and slept late, so it naturally falls to Fluttershy.       Luckily, it's all odd and bits of work, and Fluttershy cleans it up in a short time, and she stews Leng Feng's tonic soup as well.       After having breakfast with his family, Leng Feng killed a big bowl of tonic soup again, but this time it didn't have the same effect as yesterday. In fact, the soup is still the original soup, but Leng Feng's physical fitness at this time is not comparable to yesterday, and these soups have little effect on his nourishment.       "I don't have to stew this soup in the future, I don't like to drink it!" After Leng Feng finished the soup, he still spoke.       After all, this is different from what he thought before, thinking that drinking soup for a long time can improve his physical fitness, but now it seems that this is not the case at all. And the current situation of their family is not what it used to be, especially this time, in order for him to get a fame, Leng Li even made a little bit of a mess up and down, and spent all the remaining savings of the family.Leng Feng knew that his family valued him now, and his words still worked, so he didn't have to spend money in this regard.       This time, instead of letting Chai Bo drive him off, or letting Fluttershy go with him, Leng Feng once again rode the skinny horse that had caused him to fall into the water. For this matter, Leng Feng also fought with Leng Li, and after riding a horse and walking back and forth, Leng Li agreed to ride into the city.       The main thing is that the last time he fell into the water caused a psychological shadow to Leng Li's family, she was afraid that she would miss the front hoof again, and Leng Feng could not have good luck every time. However, seeing Leng Feng's flexible skills on the horse, coupled with the fact that the old horse was also very stable this time, this made Leng Feng ride into the city.       As for why he fell into the water last time, Leng Feng knew in his heart that it was not a horse that stumbled at all, but someone did it on purpose. This old horse was also a gift to Leng Feng when his father was there. At that time, this horse was raised by Leng Feng, and he had a good relationship with Leng Feng, and he was also very docile.       This is also the reason why people can find out for the first time after Leng Da Shao falls, mainly because the loud sorrow of the old horse attracted the attention of passers-by. But it's a pity that Leng Dashao was already out of breath when he was rescued.       However, if there is no old horse, maybe he will have to wait until Leng Dashao's body is swollen before he can be found. If that's really the case, even if Leng Feng's soul crosses over, he can't be reborn through the corpse.       Therefore, Leng Feng is still very grateful to this old horse.       Coming to Linjiang City today, Leng Feng's mood is very different from the past. In the past, when I was a cold teenager, I lived in a mess all day long, and I didn't think about what the future would be.       Even yesterday, Leng Feng came to this world as a reborn person, and he didn't have the mentality he has today. Yesterday, although he knew his situation and had some plans in his heart on how to deal with the crisis, those were still too vague. And some methods also take time to implement, and what he lacks is precisely time.       After last night's discovery, he is now confident that he will have the strength to protect himself in a short period of time. Even if he put aside the experience of the special forces king in his previous life, he would not be afraid of the calculations of his two uncles.       All conspiracies and tricks will come to naught in the face of great strength.       What's more, Leng Feng, as a reborn person, has the blessing of God's perspective and future technology. If it's like this, and it can still be calculated by the two uncles, it will really be a shame for the reborn.       Throwing the horse to an inn outside the academy, Leng Feng walked into the Linjiang Academy with two gift boxes. When Leng Feng arrived at the gate of Linjiang Academy, he was led in by the concierge who was waiting there. This kind of treatment is the first time Leng Feng has enjoyed it in more than ten years.       It seems that no matter what era it is, identity is a golden signboard.       "Mountain Chief, Master Chen, the juniors are so polite!"       "Haha, good, good!"       When the mountain chief and Chen Shi saw Leng Feng coming, they immediately burst out laughing.       Before, they were wondering if Leng Feng would come over to meet them today. After all, Leng Feng is now holding the title of the top of the list, and with Leng Dashao's original character, it is completely possible not to take the two of them in his eyes.       However, the current Leng Feng is not the original Leng Dashao, he knows very well the importance of human feelings in this situation. When you don't have the strength to do what you want, then you have to learn to go with the flow.       Careless!       Sometimes it doesn't necessarily mean weakness, but accumulating strength in order to be stronger in the future.Of course, in Leng Feng's opinion, this is not called following the crowd, after all, these two people really helped him, and it is also appropriate to express his gratitude.       Leng Feng still understands that if he wants to make a difference in this world, he must establish his own circle of influence. To establish a circle of influence, we must first start with the people around us, especially in this era, when troubled times are coming, and we must be prepared now.       Although these two can't help him in terms of force, as respected elders, not to mention the peach and plum all over the world, the two of them have some ability to govern the world.       "Mountain Chief, Master Chen, this is a small gift prepared by my mother for the two of you, a little heart-wrenching!" Leng Feng handed over the gift box in his hand and put it on the table on the side.       "It's a shame for me to be ashamed of the eldest lady in this matter! However, it is gratifying that Leng Feng, you have great talents, and your future will be limited! ”
       "What the mountain chief said is very true, I didn't expect that Leng Feng could be amazing, it's really terrifying!"       "Mountain Chief and Master Chen are tormenting boys, this time it's just luck!"       Leng Feng was telling the truth, he didn't think that the knowledge he had mastered in his previous life would be able to come out on top in the imperial examination in this era. However, in the ears of the mountain chief and Master Chen, it meant something else, and they thought that Leng Feng was being modest.       The two sides each said a few words of humility, and Leng Feng also did his due courtesy. Before proposing to say goodbye, the mountain chief casually asked, "Leng Feng, are your greetings ready?" ”
       "Please!"       Leng Feng was stunned when he heard this, he really didn't care about it. The main thing is that I am used to the life of modern society, and I am not familiar with many etiquettes of this era.       Mountain Chief and Master Chen glanced at each other, revealing an expression that was indeed like this, and now Leng Feng looked like he had a trace of what he had before. Only the previous Leng Da Shao could not take this matter to heart.       Because in their opinion, the current cold front is a bit too unreal, and it is too different from what people in the past imagined.       "Hmmm! That's okay, we have ready-made pen and ink here! The mountain chief said, rubbing his beard.       Leng Feng only realized at this time, although he knew that the top ten in the selection test were going to meet the master of the Daoist according to the convention, but as for Leng Feng, who was sticking to something, he was not prepared.       This is not to blame him, but now there are only a few women left in the Leng family, and they don't know much about this aspect. Second, Leng Feng himself didn't know about it, the previous Leng Dashao didn't learn and didn't know how to do it, so he didn't have any concept of it at all, and Leng Feng himself came from modern society, where did he know these red tape etiquette.       "Hmmm! Indeed, I was not prepared! Leng Feng didn't make excuses, but honestly admitted.       "How can you not prepare for such an important matter, fortunately you came to us first, otherwise it might be bad when you get to the side of Master Xuedao!" Master Chen looked at Leng Feng and said in a slightly lesson-telling tone.       "Master Chen's criticism is right, the kid used to be stubborn, and there are still many unclear points about these etiquettes, so please ask the mountain chief and Master Chen for advice!"       Seeing that Leng Feng's attitude was good, and what Leng Feng said was reasonable, he was indeed stubborn before.       "Well, then we'll tell you the relevant etiquette to pay attention to here, and how to write this worship sticker!"Under the guidance of the mountain chief and Master Chen, Leng Feng quickly mastered the relevant etiquette and the content of the prayer post. This time Leng Feng didn't pretend, he really didn't know this, but Leng Feng learned quickly, and he had mastered these without a second time.       With the written greeting post, Leng Feng walked to the yamen of Linjiang County.       Although he has lived in Linjiang City for more than ten years since he was a child, and his father was once the richest man in Linjiang City, to be honest, Leng Feng has never entered the yamen of Linjiang City.       The yamen of this era is more majestic than the government buildings of modern society in the hearts of the common people. Although the scale of the building is not as good as it is now, in the minds of the common people, the yamen is not something that ordinary people can enter. Either it's an official, or it's a person who has committed a crime.       However, Leng Feng does not have this kind of mentality, in his opinion, the yamen of this era is the same thing.       Stuffed a little bit of broken silver to the little errand at the door, this person immediately smiled and was respectful to Leng Feng, and ran to the yamen.       In fact, with Leng Feng's identity today, there is no need for this at all. But Leng Feng also understands that no matter what era it is, the role of banknote ability is powerful. Leng Dashao in this era has lived for more than ten years, and the only reason he understands is to use money to open the way, in the previous Leng Dashao's view, there is no problem that money can't solve.       If there is, it means that not enough money has been smashed.       Today, Leng Feng came to the top of the selection test, even if he didn't give the little errand at the yamen a copper coin, he would send the news for Leng Feng, but it would definitely not be this attitude.       The current Leng Feng is not the previous Leng Da Shao, Leng Da Shao is a salted fish, and naturally he is the biggest in the world. Leng Feng is different, if he wants to live happily in this world, the first problem is to be alive. And if you want to live well, you must develop your power, and once you develop your power, you can't get around the government of this era.       Don't underestimate the little errands of the yamen, they may not have other skills, but the news is definitely first-class. Familiar with the essence of intelligence warfare in his previous life, Leng Feng understands better that in an era when there is no scientific and technological means, people from all walks of life are intelligence personnel who can be used.       Sure enough, he didn't let Leng Feng wait long, and the little errand officer quickly ran out with a smile on his face: "Leng Dashao, please inside!" ”
       "Thank you!" Leng Feng nodded and smiled at the little messenger, and then stepped in.       Seeing Leng Feng's departing back, the little errand muttered to himself: "Who said that Leng Dashao is arrogant and arrogant without learning and unskilled, sure enough, the rumors are not credible!" ”
       At this time, Leng Feng was definitely a gentle and knowledgeable boy in the minds of the little errand officer.       Leng Feng didn't know the psychology of the little errand, and if he knew, he would also smile faintly. This is completely the role of the banknote ability, coupled with the change of temperament and image, the first impression is really invincible.       The main reason is that this little errand officer has never seen Leng Feng before, so it will have this effect. People like Mountain Chief and Master Chen, who used to deal with Leng Feng a lot, it was not so easy to change their impression.       After Leng Feng walked into the back hall of the yamen, he found that there were already seven or eight teenagers here. This group of young Leng Feng all knew each other, except for the five outsiders who came with the Master of Xuedao, the other three were all scholars of Linjiang College, and they could be regarded as Leng Feng's classmates.       It seems that Master Xuedao is preparing to meet them together.Leng Feng's arrival did not seem surprising to others at all. However, since Leng Feng was the top of the list, after these scholars saw Leng Feng, they all nodded and smiled at him. Even the master of the Dao who was sitting in the first place also looked at Leng Feng with a smile.       According to the etiquette he learned from the mountain chief before, Leng Feng did it in a proper manner. After the salute, he sat down at the suggestion of the master of the way.       Leng Feng's performance was normal in the eyes of the Daoist Lord, but in the eyes of the other three scholars of Linjiang Academy, it was a little strange.       After all, in their past impressions, Leng Feng never seemed to have any etiquette with anyone. Although everyone is a classmate of Linjiang Academy, and Leng Feng's father is the richest man in Linjiang City, to be honest, these people still regard Leng Feng as a vulgar person in their hearts.       It's not that these people think that Leng Feng dares to be rude to Master Xuedao, but that they see Leng Feng's polite appearance in their eyes, which is completely exuded from their bones. If they don't know what kind of virtue Leng Dashao used to be, they still think that they are the children of the family where they came from.       In the past, Leng Dashao only knew that the sky was against the air, and he never knew how to be polite to people. Even before winning the top spot yesterday, it was not a beating for Du and Zhang. Although he later got along with all the scholars, everyone just praised each other at that time, and they didn't see how polite Leng Dashao was.       But it's also relieved to think about it, now that Leng Feng can even get the capital of the list, what else is impossible to happen?       So everyone was just puzzled in their hearts, and their faces showed a little strangeness, but they didn't say anything. Almost as soon as Leng Feng sat down, another scholar also came.       "Ladies and gentlemen, you are all the pillars of the future nation! As you all know, now that the imperial court is employing people, I hope you can seize this opportunity and become the minister of the humerus! ”
       Xuedao Jiang Yuanzhi put down the tea in his hand and said in a tone with seven points of majesty and three points of passion.       "I'm going to thank Master Xuedao for your support!"       After learning from the adults, the scholars hurriedly got up and bowed.       "I don't dare to say it, the old man is just a few years older than you. However, in terms of education and being an official, I can still give you some pointers. The eyes of the learned adults scanned the crowd again, and nodded with satisfaction.       "Students are willing to sit down and listen to the teachings of adults, and if they do not give up, they will be ruined!" At this time, a clever scholar immediately took the apprenticeship post and said aloud.       "We are also willing to sit down and listen to the teachings of the adults, if we do not give up, we will be ruined!"       When the others saw it, they also stepped forward to salute. Even Leng Feng was no exception, but at this time, he made up his mind to follow the crowd and no longer be in the limelight.       Although Jiang Yuanzhi is a scholar of Jiankang Mansion, to be honest, Leng Feng hasn't really taken this level of character very seriously. Not only the scholars of the Tao, but also the entire Southern Song Dynasty court, in the eyes of Leng Feng, it was like that.       This is mainly due to the mentality of the reborn people, who already know that the Southern Song Dynasty court will soon perish. And as a person of later generations, he really did not have a good impression of the Southern Song court.       "Hahaha, good! You are all dragons and phoenixes among people, and you are awarded by the world's talents, what an honor! Jiang Yuanzhi laughed and said.Although Jiang Yuanzhi is a scholar of the first house, his faction is not very powerful in the imperial court, and can only be regarded as the middle and lower reaches. is the selection test this time, and he is only in charge of one place in Linjiang City. And this place is still he tried his best to get it, after all, Linjiang City is in the area of Jiankang Mansion, which is a relatively prosperous city.       There are 100 places in the entire Jiankang Mansion, and the Jiankang Mansion alone accounts for 50, and the remaining 50 are divided among other counties. Linjiang County occupies ten places, which shows that the status of Linjiang County is not low in Jiankang Mansion.       Jiang Yuanzhi brought the disciples of the five factions with him this time, and in addition, he also included five local students from Linjiang City. These people are almost all in his camp, and he has successfully completed this mission.       Especially at the top of the list this time, the more Leng Feng's article made him feel that it was not simple the more he read it, and he had already sent someone to report this article. If he can finally enter the Dharma eye of the current saint, he will be regarded as a great achievement.       After everyone had done the apprenticeship, Jiang Yuanzhi instructed everyone again, especially instructing everyone how to write articles that were in line with the holy will. After this exchange, half a day passed, and even everyone ate at noon in the yamen.       It can be seen that Jiang Yuanzhi has indeed put some thought into Leng Feng and others.       After all, people in this era pay attention to the relationship between master and apprentice, and there is a saying that one day is a teacher, and a father is a lifelong. Therefore, both teachers and students attach great importance to this relationship.       After the meal, the relationship between everyone seems to be more familiar. Leng Feng also knew the specific identities of the five scholars, they were all disciples of the family, but they were not descendants in the family. But their status is much higher than that of ordinary people.       According to the original plan of the current saint this time, such a person will not be selected. However, there are policies and countermeasures, and these disciples of the family have already moved their student status to Linjiang College before, but they are only coming over now.       In fact, this situation has appeared in many selection places, which is a result of everyone's game with each other.       Even today's saints know a little about this, but there seems to be a tacit understanding between the monarchs and ministers. Today, the Holy Majesty has acquiesced in the practices of the various factions, and the same factions have also fully implemented His Majesty's selection policy.       Although Leng Feng didn't understand the trickiness of this, through his own observations, he could probably guess some of the reasons. This is also the reason why he doesn't pay much attention to the current court, it's no wonder that such a court doesn't perish!       During this period, the Southern Song Dynasty court had actually reached a pathological level, and it was still the kind that was not lightly ill. Just like the era in which Leng Feng lived, the poet Lin Sheng, who had never appeared in the history of this dynasty, described: The tourists who were smoked were drunk, and only put Hangzhou Bianzhou. And more, and more.       Standing in the trend of the times, Leng Feng understands that the current imperial court is just surviving, and it may be finished one day.       Of course, if he doesn't have the strength, when that day comes, he may also be overwhelmed by the tide of history.       On this point, Leng Feng sees it more thoroughly than everyone in this era.       When everyone said goodbye one by one, Leng Feng was left behind by Master Xuedao and met alone. In this regard, Leng Feng was not surprised at all, he had already had a premonition. Because when the Daoist looked at him before, he could clearly feel that he looked at others differently.Master Xuedao left him for two reasons, the first is to express his appreciation for Leng Feng, especially explaining that Leng Feng's article has been submitted by him, and it is very hopeful that he can enter the eyes of today's saints. If this article is favored by the current saint, then Leng Feng is likely to be appreciated by His Majesty when he enters the capital this time. As long as you manage well, the future achievements are limitless.       At the same time, it also hinted that the power of himself and the faction behind him in the court, only with their help, Leng Feng could realize this possibility.       Leng Feng is not a fool, he naturally knows what Lord Xuedao means, it is nothing more than wanting to completely pull himself into their faction.       However, it is clear that Leng Feng will not follow Jiang Yuanzhi and them with all his heart. After all, the skin does not exist, and Leng Feng still knows the truth that Mao will be overthrown. The Southern Song Dynasty court can't even protect itself, these factions are still fighting for power, is this interesting in Leng Feng's opinion?       In his previous life, Leng Feng was a person who valued the national righteousness and the world very seriously. Otherwise, he would not have become the king of special forces, he was born and died many times for the country, and finally even lost his life.       How can such a person get used to the actions of the Southern Song Dynasty court. From top to bottom, almost all the people in power are calculating Xiao Jiujiu for their own interests.       Of course, Leng Feng is not stupid, he knows the truth that his little arms can't twist his thighs. Although today's Southern Song Dynasty court is rotten and lonely, Leng Feng is not even a hair compared to Yiyi, and people can easily crush him. In such a situation, Leng Feng naturally knew what to do.       "Everything for students is taught by adults, and everything is for adults!"       Leng Feng understood in his heart what Jiang Yuanzhi, the master of the Dao, wanted to express, so he naturally replied according to his wishes.       "Haha, good! This official really didn't see the wrong person, but it's not suitable to call an adult now! Jiang Yuanzhi was very satisfied with Leng Feng's performance.       "Yes, the student obeys the teacher's orders!" Leng Feng immediately put on a teachable appearance.       "Hmmm! I will leave you behind, and I have one more thing to explain to you. ”
       Jiang Yuanzhi took out a piece of jade and continued: "This was given to me by Li Shanchang of Linjiang Academy, he said that this is your family's belongings, let me take care of you." I didn't expect you to have such a great talent, the teacher deserves it! ”
       Jiang Yuanzhi's face showed a trace of guilt, and at the same time, there was a trace of reluctance hidden in the guilt. After finishing speaking, he solemnly handed this piece of jade to Leng Feng.       How could the expression on Jiang Yuanzhi's face be hidden from Leng Feng, but Leng Feng pretended not to know, and reached out to take the jade. Although this piece of jade is precious, Leng Feng is not reluctant, he just wants to see Jiang Yuanzhi's reaction at this time.       Jiang Yuanzhi didn't expect that Leng Feng would take over this piece of jade so neatly. To be honest, the second reason why he left Leng Feng behind was that he did have plans to return this piece of jade to Leng Feng.       After all, Jiang Yuanzhi is optimistic about Leng Feng, and Leng Feng's treatise on Qin is the best one he has seen over the years.If Leng Feng can continue to perform at this level, he will surely be a blockbuster during the interview. At this time, having a good relationship with Leng Feng will definitely be far greater than this piece of jade in the future. Although he loved this piece of jade very much in his heart, he also knew that if he wanted to befriend Leng Feng, it was best to return the jade to him.       Not only that, but he will also imply that those who have benefited from the cold front will also return their belongings to the cold front.       After all, pure human affection is much stronger than a relationship mixed with material interests.       Just as the thought in Jiang Yuanzhi's heart flashed, a subtle smile appeared on the corner of Leng Feng's mouth. He could feel that Jiang Yuanzhi's mood had changed at this time. I don't know if it's the result of last night's cultivation or the benefits brought by rebirth, now Leng Feng's five senses are extremely keen.       He found that although Jiang Yuanzhi was reluctant to give up on this piece of jade, it was not all hypocrisy to return this piece of jade to him. It seems that although Jiang Yuanzhi has some shortcomings, he is not an unsociable person.       "Teacher, since you like this stone, how can the disciple take away the beauty of people? This stone should be used as a student to honor you, teacher! ”
       When Leng Feng stuffed the jade into Jiang Yuanzhi's hand again, he realized how quickly the turn had come. Even if Jiang Yuanzhi was a Daoist master, his thinking at this time could not keep up with Leng Feng's movements.       In fact, Jiang Yuanzhi is not a pedantic person, and the reason why he is a little distracted at this moment is mainly because he did not predict Leng Feng's reaction at this time, and Leng Feng predicted his prediction.       "This, how does this make!"       Jiang Yuanzhi, the master of the Dao, was actually only half a beat slower, and after reacting, he immediately pushed the jade in his hand towards Leng Feng's side.       However, Leng Feng had already made up his mind, although this piece of jade was a good thing, it was useless to put it in his hand, and giving it to Jiang Yuanzhi was tantamount to deepening the relationship between the two parties.       In particular, Leng Feng could feel the peculiar pedantic aura of a scholar and the cunning of the old fox from Jiang Yuanzhi. This personality trait is a product of this era.       The person who can have this kind of mixed characteristics must have been a hot-blooded scholar before, but after entering the officialdom, he has been corrupted by officialdom. However, such a person is worth investing in, at least he will not easily turn his face and deny people.       Favor investment is also a science, which involves looking at people's vision accurately. Some people are wolf-hearted, that is, no matter how much you invest in him, once he feels that he can't get benefits from you, he will ignore you and even throw himself into your hostility.       Once you meet such a person, the more you invest in him, the more damage you will get in the end.       In the end, Jiang Yuanzhi accepted this piece of jade again, and he was naturally happy in his heart. Correspondingly, the attitude towards Leng Feng is much closer.       When Leng Feng left the yamen, there were no accidents this time, and the little errand at the door was even more enthusiastic about him. And Leng Feng didn't put on any show, and chatted with him for a few words.       Just these few sentences allowed Leng Feng to get some useful information. From the mouth of the little errand officer, he learned that several waves of people had inquired about him during this time. Some people also said that Leng Dashao could be received by the master of the Daoist alone, and he would soar in the future.       If it weren't for this little errand officer, he really didn't know about it, it seems that in the half hour that he communicated with Jiang Yuanzhi, the master of the Dao, the news had already spread through a certain channel.After all, the level of the Lord of the Daoist is two levels higher than that of the Lord of Linjiang City, and in the officialdom, there is a saying that the official level crushes people to death. As a master of learning from the five grades, although he can't manage Linjiang City in specific affairs, his connections and relationships will definitely surpass that of the magistrate of Linjiang City.       If Master Xuedao can meet Leng Feng alone, it shows that he values Leng Feng, and some well-informed people will naturally activate their minds. After all, this is human nature, and those who are ready to have a good relationship with Leng Feng know when to behave.       These people Leng Feng naturally don't care, what he cares about is his two good uncles, and he will definitely be stimulated.       Leng Feng's guess is not bad at all, the two good uncles in his heart are indeed very exciting, and they are planning how to kill him!       "Is it arranged?"       In the courtyard of Leng Second Master's house, Leng Feng's second uncle had a gloomy face, as if he could drip water.       "Second brother, don't worry, everything has been arranged!" Leng Feng's third uncle also said with a gloomy face.       "Well, if people don't do it for themselves, heaven and earth will be destroyed! Even if Emperor Lao Tzu fought for that position, wasn't it also a river of blood from fratricidal killing? My good nephew, don't blame the second uncle for being ruthless, if you want to blame this wealth for touching people's hearts! ”
       After speaking, the second uncle raised his head and drank the teacup in his hand.       At this time, the second uncle's face was very terrible, even the third uncle couldn't help but shudder when he looked at the second uncle's expression. Once a person is consumed by the desire for profit, he will become a devil, which makes people shudder.       After a while, several figures walked out of the courtyard of Second Master Leng and disappeared at the end of the street after three turns and two turns.       Although Leng Feng couldn't guess the plan of the two uncles, he could guess that they would definitely not be able to wait, maybe they would do it to themselves in the next two days. After all, Leng Feng at this time was no longer the Leng Dashao three days ago, and he had already threatened the two uncles.       When Leng Feng walked back to the inn and pulled out his skinny horse, he found that there was already a group of people waiting for him in the inn, and these were the other nine people who had visited Master Xuedao with him before.       After seeing Leng Feng, all nine people got up and bowed their hands, and Leng Feng also returned the salute. This is where Leng Feng is not used to, the etiquette of people in this era is really too cumbersome, and a set of etiquette can be made for any occasion.       "Brother Leng, I've been waiting for a long time, I don't know if I can get together!" One of them arched his hand.       This person is also from Linjiang Academy, but he didn't have much contact with Leng Feng before. But now Leng Feng has also become one of the ten Face Sages, and he is also selected as the top of the list, and now this identity is naturally different.       "Brother Leng and I have had many misunderstandings before, after all, we were both young at that time, and today we are all from the same family, so we should let go of our previous suspicions. Why don't I do it today, and prepare a little wine, please be a witness! Liang Dong also walked up from behind and said.       I have to say that this Liang Dong is not only handsome, but also beautiful in speech. This really makes Leng Feng impeccable, unless Leng Feng incarnates as the unreasonable Leng Dashao again, and gives him two punches without saying a word.       But obviously, Leng Feng is not cold, although he is also indifferent to Liang Dong, but he has his own code of conduct.This time, Liang Dong also accounted for one of the top ten face saint places. When we were visiting Master Xuedao together just now, Leng Feng also saw this person, but Leng Feng didn't have much interest in this guy, so he ignored him.       The previous Leng Da rarely had two old enemies, these two people happened to be one writer and one martial artist, Zhou Tong's martial artist naturally didn't need to say much, and the other one was this Wen Zou Zou's little white-faced Liang Dong. Since he is an old enemy, Leng Feng naturally does not believe that this Liang Dong will turn into a war with him.       Leng Feng raised his eyes and looked at Liang Dong, although this guy was full of smiles and looked kind. But under Leng Feng's eyes of knowledge, he could detect that in the depths of Liang Dong's eyes, there was a hidden vicious gaze.       "Since Brother Liang is so sincere, it is better to be respectful than to obey his fate!" Leng Feng also said with a smile on his face.       Leng Feng is really not afraid of what the other party is playing, doesn't he just want to play! Then have a good time with you and see what tricks you can play.       "Brother Leng's article is very amazing, I am impressed, I want to have a good exchange with Brother Leng today."       In addition to Liang Dong and the others, the five children of the family who came with Master Xuedao also showed a strong interest in Leng Feng.       "Everyone, Miao praised!" Leng Feng said.       "As Brother Leng said before, the article is natural, and the magic hand is even good! Just because Brother Leng can say such a punch line, it can be seen that Brother Leng is definitely talented! ”
       So, in the mutual praise of everyone, everyone came to the bank of the Linjiang River together.       The Linjiang River is a tributary of the Yangtze River, but its other end is connected to the sea, and Linjiang City is built between the river and the sea. The geographical conditions here are very superior, whether it is property or transportation, it is considered to be one of the few rich places in the Southern Song Dynasty.       As long as the Yangtze River is not breached, then Linjiang City will have peace of mind.       It is in this environment that Linjiang City is still a place where merchants from the south to the north must pass through after several wars. At the same time, there are not a few taverns in the city, especially on the banks of the river, there are many flower boats for people to have fun.       Today, Liang Dong's place of hospitality is on the bank of the Linjiang River, and he has chartered a flower boat. The Liang family used to be just a small family in decline, but now with the support of Second Master Leng, it has a rising trend.       Otherwise, with the previous situation of the Liang family, Liang Dong definitely did not have the strength to come here to entertain.       Leng Feng also understood that the money that Liang Dong spent was all sucking the blood of their family. Sooner or later, this account will have to be recovered, and let them jump for a while first.       As the son of the richest man in Linjiang City, Leng Dashao was no stranger to this kind of place. Drinking flower wine, visiting the Qinglou, Leng Dashao has not done less.       However, there is one thing that makes Leng Feng feel strange, that is, so far, Leng Dashao is still a virgin.       According to the cultivation rules of innate divine skills, only the body of a child can cultivate innate divine skills. But whether it is the body of a child or not, as long as you cultivate the innate divine skills, you can find out.       From this point of view, although Leng Dashao is squirrel, he is not lustful. It is not uncommon for men in this era to get married in their teens, and it is not new for people to have children at thirteen or fourteen. In this regard, Leng Dashao can be regarded as a miracle that he can clean himself."Everyone, please!" Liang Dong made a gesture to guide everyone to the flower boat he had chartered.       The flower boats of this era were not as grand as they were seen on later television, but were actually just a slightly larger wooden boat with a table on it, and most of the food and drinks were prepared on the shore. The boat was accompanied by only some fruit and melon snacks, as well as drinks. The courtesans and dancers did not live on the ship all the time, but all of them came from the green houses on the shore.       But it's just such a toss, and it looks very stylish. The same service may cost more than twice the price, but many people still like this tone.       Leng Dashao had visited this kind of flower boat more than once before, but basically he invited others as the host, and today was the first time he was invited to a banquet by others.       However, Leng Feng knew that there was no good banquet in this banquet, and Liang Dong's intention to invite him to the banquet today would definitely not be so simple.       In this era, one of the advantages is that people can visit the green house and drink flower wine in the open. In particular, a group of high-spirited scholars, boating on the lake, and reciting poems in groups are a kind of elegance and fashion in the eyes of people in this era.       Even if the Southern Song Dynasty court has experienced several years of war and turmoil, whether it is among the people or the court, this social atmosphere is still very prevalent.       It can be said that this is an era of entertainment to death.       In fact, among the previous dynasties, the economy of the Great Song Dynasty was quite good. However, having money alone does not pay attention to other aspects, which is also the main reason why the combat effectiveness of the Great Song army is not strong.       Those who are in charge of the army do not have the power of those who pay lip service, and the military pay cannot be implemented, and most of them go into private pockets. Those in power only know how to seek benefits for themselves, where can they care about the lives and deaths of the common people. The external struggle is not good, but the internal struggle is to the death.       Of course, it is not excluded that there are a small number of patriots and sober people, but under this general trend, these people can play a limited role. In the end, they are either assimilated or ostracized.       This is the true portrayal of the times, and it is also the reason why Leng Feng obviously doesn't like the rules and systems of this era, but now he has to integrate into them.       Having a tiger in your heart and sniffing roses is a quality that anyone who can achieve great things must have.       As for the protagonists in those cool novels, they can't get used to seeing whoever goes up and do it, pushing the invincible opponent in the world, and everything is self-respecting may exist. But in the current environment of the cold front, it is tantamount to self-defeating.       After all, Leng Feng was the king of special forces in his previous life, and he had performed too many dangerous missions, he knew how to disguise himself and how to really complete the goal. Just do it with a gun, that's a reckless behavior, even if it's done on the battlefield, it's undoubtedly looking for death.       After entering the cabin, everyone sat down according to the guests and hosts, and the table was full of tea and fruit snacks. With a shout, the boat slowly sailed away from the shore.       After all, Leng Feng and the others are not ordinary scholars, and they are still different from those who come here to have fun. Readers pay attention to the wind and snow, and at the same time, they still have to pay attention to a certain style.       Liang Dong also understands this, it's okay to drink flower wine, but you can't do flower things. Therefore, there was only one geisha and two women who served on the ship. The geisha burned incense and stroked the piano for everyone at the bow of the boat, and the two women poured tea and water for everyone in the boat.       Chapter 36: Spring River Flower Moonlit Night
As the flower boat slowly moved on the river, everyone in the cabin also talked enthusiastically. Although it has been a literati since ancient times, it also depends on what kind of occasion it is, after all, readers have more eyes and know how to make trade-offs than most people.       "With such a beautiful day, we are gathered here, why don't we chant poetry to help the fun?" At this time, Liang Dong proposed.       "Brother Liang's attainments in poetry and poetry are quite profound, so it's better to start with Brother Liang!" Someone chimed in.       "In this way, then it will be ugly!"       Liang Dong hugged his fists, and then straightened his clothes casually with both hands, which had a sense of elegance. He turned his head slightly to look around, and then said, "The shore grass is barren, and it is in the vocal music." The apricots are obtained at the beginning of the evening, but the flowers on the riverside are idle. ”
       "Wonderful, Brother Liang's poem is really wonderful! The wild grass on the shore is sandwiched with wild flowers, and the apricot yellow dress of the wonderful person who caress the piano floats on the river with the beautiful sound of the piano, reflecting the happy mood of our waiting. ”
       As soon as Liang Dong chanted a poem, someone immediately chimed in. In fact, Liang Dong's poem is quite appropriate, but it is just like that, and it does not have that sense of amazement.       Liang Dong made a start, and the others also chanted poems to echo him. Poetry and poetry are a necessary skill for readers in this era, isn't there such a sentence: be familiar with 300 Tang poems, and you will be able to chant poetry if you can't chant poetry. It's about the situation of readers in this era, whether it's good or not, in short, it's just that they can chant poems.       What's more, those who can enter the top ten are all really talented and learned.       Although Leng Feng is not as good as the scholars of this era in this regard, he has the memory of the previous life, and in his era, there were countless writers, far more than this era. Take out any of them, and you can beat the vast majority of poets of this era.       Originally, Leng Feng didn't want to be in the limelight, but when he saw Liang Dong's smug look, he had an urge to beat him.       "Brother Leng's articles can be written so amazingly, presumably his attainments in poetry and songs must be good! Brother Leng has a masterpiece, let me enjoy it! ”
       Liang Dong saw that everyone was composing poems one after another, but Leng Feng was still unmoved, turned to Leng Feng and said.       In fact, Liang Dong is selfish, Leng Feng became the top of the list in this selection test, and he felt very uncomfortable. In the past, when everyone was in Linjiang Academy, although Leng Feng didn't deal with him at that time, he often made trouble with him. But Liang Dong was arrogant at that time, and he didn't take Leng Feng in his eyes.       Now that the situation has changed, Leng Feng defeated him in the area he thought he was best at, which made Liang Dong, who had always had a strong self-esteem, reconcile.       If it was really like what Leng Feng said before, he could write that Qin Treatise entirely because he was usually interested in it. I had thought about it before, and I already had an idea in my heart to write an article of that level. So in this situation, let's play on the spot, he believes that with his understanding of Leng Feng, he will definitely be inferior to himself in this regard.       And he also saw that everyone looked like they were grinding their fists just now, but Leng Feng looked calm. In Liang Dong's opinion, he didn't think that Leng Feng was confident, but thought that he was pretending to be profound.       "Spring River Flower Moonlight Night"       Just as Liang Dong was about to speak, he suddenly spit out five words from Leng Feng's mouth. This made Liang Dong's words immediately blocked when he came to his mouth, and the expression on Jun's face was very unnatural.       "This, what kind of poem is this?" Liang Dong was instinctively stunned, he felt that this was not like poetry, but there was an indescribable charm.       Not only Liang Dong, but also other people feel this way.Leng Feng ignored everyone's doubts, paused slightly, and after exhaling softly, he spoke again: "The tide of the Spring River is even with the sea, and the bright moon on the sea is born together. ”
       As soon as these two sentences came out, everyone's faces changed, because at this time everyone reacted, it turned out that the Spring River Flower Moon Night that Leng Feng said before was the name of this poem. And just from these two opening verses, you can feel that this poem is extremely not simple.       "Thousands of miles with the waves, where there is no moon in the spring river!"       When the next sentence came out, everyone's faces changed again, and they could already be sure that this poem must be extraordinary when it comes out.       "The river flows around Fangdian, and the moonlight flowers and forests are like hail; The frost in the air does not fly, and the white sand on the Ting cannot be seen.       Jiangtian is colorless and dustless, and the lonely moon wheel in the bright sky. Who first saw the moon on the riverside? When did Jiang Yue shine at the beginning of the year?       Life has been infinite for generations, and Jiang Yue is only similar every year. I don't know who Jiang Yue treats, but I see the Yangtze River sending water.       The white clouds are gone, and the green maple is not worried. Who's going to be in the boat tonight? Where is Acacia Mingyue Tower?       At this time, we don't hear each other, and we are willing to shine on you month by month. The wild goose flies for a long time, and the fish and dragon dive into the water.       Last night, the dream of the idle pool fell, and the poor spring did not return home. The river flows to the end of spring, and the moon falls in the river and the lake slopes westward.       The oblique moon sinks into the sea fog, and the stone Xiaoxiang has an infinite road. I don't know how many people will return to the moon, and the falling moon will shake the river trees. ”
       In the surprised eyes of everyone, Leng Feng recited the Spring River Flower Moon Night by the Tang Dynasty poet Zhang Ruoxu in one breath. Anyway, there is no such person as Zhang Ruoxu in this historical era, and I am not afraid that some people will say that he is plagiarized.       After a few breaths, everyone came back to their senses from the artistic conception of the moonlit night in the spring river. At this time, anyone who heard Leng Feng chanting the moonlit night of the Spring River was all excited, and even Liang Dong could not admit that Leng Feng's poem was a masterpiece.       "What a moonlit night in the Spring River, it's really shocking!"       "The tide of the spring river is even with the sea, and the bright moon on the sea is born together. The beginning goes straight to the hearts of the people, a masterpiece, it is really a masterpiece! ”
       "I don't know how many people return to the moon, and the falling moon is full of love and trees. It's really surprising who can express this kind of artistic conception! ”
       All of a sudden, everyone couldn't help but comment on this spring river flower moonlit night. The more I savored it, the more I felt that this poem was not simple. In the eyes of these scholars, this Spring River Flower Moon is even more amazing than the Qin treatise written by Leng Feng before.       After all, in the eyes of these scholars, it was a coincidence that Leng Feng was able to write Qin Theory. Moreover, although the essay during the exam can reflect a person's talent, what really shows a person's talent is this kind of poetry that is played on the spot.       "In the next place, just make a nonsense song, let everyone laugh!"       Leng Feng smiled secretly in his heart when he saw everyone's performance, but he still pretended to be modest. For this Spring River Flower Moon Night, like the Qin Treatise, in fact, Leng Feng's previous life has not been fully remembered. All this is thanks to the benefits brought by rebirth, as long as it is something he has seen before, he can completely recreate it in his mind.This is thanks to the nine-year compulsory education in his previous life, Leng Feng read this poem when he was in junior high school, and he knew that this poem was known as the word "Two Song Songs", and the lone piece covered the whole Tang Dynasty. In the Tang and Song dynasties, where many writers and heroes came out, it can be seen how amazing the moonlit night of the Spring River is.       It would be an overkill to bring this poem out now. But who made Leng Feng a traverser, and the traverser is so arrogant in this regard.       "Brother Leng is too humble, once this article spreads, Brother Leng's name will be known to everyone." A scholar surnamed Li said.       This man was one of the five scholars from outside, and although they were arrogant, they were also deeply impressed after the poem was published.       "The words are clear and beautiful, the rhyme is beautiful, and it is not an exaggeration to say that it can be called a swan song for the ages."       "The whole text integrates poetry and philosophy, the artistic conception is empty, the imagination is peculiar, the language is natural and timeless, and the rhythm is melodious. Brother Leng can definitely move the world with this fame, and it is indeed beyond my reach. ”
       This time, everyone was convinced from the bottom of their hearts. Although Leng Feng's previous discussion on Qin also caused a sensation, these people did not necessarily admire it completely sincerely.       is Liang Dong, who has no arrogance at this time. His poem, compared to the moonlit night of the spring river, is like fireflies and the bright moon.       As soon as Leng Feng's Spring River Flower Moon Night came out, the others were no longer interested in chanting poetry.       At this time, they had come to the center of the Linjiang River, and everyone was also seated on the banquet, and for a while they began to staggered and push the glasses and change the lamps.       Most of the food was prepared on the shore, and there were not many kinds of food in this era, and there was also a simple pot stove on board, which was mainly used for keeping warm. However, the little guy in charge of serving the food attracted Leng Feng's attention, this person looked in his thirties and looked very ordinary.       The reason why Leng Feng attracted Leng Feng's attention was mainly because this person walked at an extremely steady pace. Although the river is calm at this time, the flower boats are floating on the river, and the people on them are more or less affected.       But this person is different, his hands are very steady when serving food, and the pace of his feet is smoother than that of a normal person on the shore.       This is not the most critical, maybe this person has been engaged in this profession for a long time and has developed a special ability. It's like the story of the oil seller – practice makes perfect. But his breathing can't deceive people, this person's breathing is restrained, and the rhythm is obviously different from ordinary people.       "Lian Jiazi!"       In addition, Leng Feng can also feel a trace of killing intent from this person's body, although this person is very well disguised, but Leng Feng was very sensitive to this aura perception as the king of the special combat team in his previous life. In addition, after cultivating the Innate Divine Skill yesterday, this feeling is even more sensitive.This kind of killing intent is different from ordinary murderous aura, which is a special aura formed after a person has blood on his hands and bears many lives. Under normal circumstances, murderous energy is not deliberately aimed at a specific person. But killing intent is different, it is aimed at a specific target, with a trace of intent formed by murderous intent.       Leng Feng could sense the danger from this person, but the aura of danger was not strong. This means that even if this person's strength is higher than Leng Feng, it is not much higher. So in this situation, Leng Feng was not very worried about his life being threatened.       The other party would definitely not have thought that he was no longer the Leng Dashao he was before, and under the contempt and carelessness of the other party, he was completely able to kill the other party.       However, Leng Feng will not be careless, after all, he is not a real Leng Dashao, and countless births and deaths in his previous life have long made him develop the habit of calmly dealing with any danger.       The other party didn't know that Leng Feng had seen through him, and was still immersed in his role-playing. It seems that the other party is very patient, or he thinks that it is not difficult to deal with Leng Feng, so he looks relaxed. This is also thanks to Leng Dashao's previous personality, although the other party has the intention of killing, but due to the wrong judgment of Leng Feng's strength, the result will be the opposite of what was expected.       All this was seen by Leng Feng, he was also waiting now, and when the other party happened, he would be killed with one blow!       As the host, Liang Dong was very enthusiastic today. And he is not the kind of nerd who only knows how to read dead books, and his performance on the wine table is also exquisite. Whether it is a few scholars in Linjiang City or the five children of the family, they can all feel that they are valued from Liang Dong's words. This feeling like a spring breeze makes everyone's wine very happy.       People like Liang Dong are definitely good material for officialdom. It's a pity that he and Leng Feng are not all the way, and they are destined to go to the opposite side. At this time, Liang Dong had already shown enough city government, and when he faced Leng Feng at the wine table, it was called enthusiasm, and he almost told everyone that he was going to bow to Leng Feng.       Liang Dong and Leng Feng drank three bowls of wine in a row, which attracted everyone's applause.       I don't know if it was influenced by Liang Dong, but the atmosphere of other people was also aroused. In addition, they were impressed by Leng Feng's Spring River Flower Moon Night before, so they were also very enthusiastic about drinking with Leng Feng.       Soon, Leng Feng drank more than ten bowls. In his previous life, when Leng Feng watched the Water Margin, there was a paragraph describing Wu Song fighting the tiger, saying that Wu Song drank eighteen bowls of wine in a row before going to Jingyanggang, and that wine was also claimed to be three bowls of wine. At that time, Leng Feng thought that the person who had not written the novel deliberately exaggerated, what kind of person could drink eighteen bowls of spirits.       But now he believes that there is a good chance that this is true.       At this time, although the wine bowl is not that kind of big bowl, there are about three taels a night, and three catties of wine are in the stomach, and many people are already overwhelmed by the wine. At this time, the liquor was called turbid liquor, which also made some sense, compared with the liquor of the era in which Leng Feng lived, whether it was in terms of appearance or alcohol content, it was several grades lower.       Due to the rough brewing process and the lack of post-processing, the wine is slightly cloudy. Although there is also a wine aroma, there is a hint of bitterness in the wine. At this time, most of the alcohol is about 120 degrees, and the slightly better wine can only reach about 30 degrees.       Therefore, there is still a certain reason for people in this era to use bowls to drink. Most people don't have much of a problem drinking two or three bowls, so there is a legend that three bowls are not enough.       With so much alcohol in the stomach, if it is said that it is changed to the previous cold and less, the amount of alcohol is definitely exceeded. But now Leng Feng's physical fitness is more than ten times stronger than that of Leng Dashao before he fell into the water, and he just felt a little drunk.It seems that Leng Feng already has eighteen bowls of wine at this time.       However, because Leng Feng sensed the killing intent of the little guy on the boat, he pretended to be drunk just right. His eyes showed a drunken and hazy look, one hand was on Liang Dong's shoulder, and the other hand was dangling the wine bowl, a lot of wine was spilled on Liang Dong's body, and his clothes were also deformed by Leng Feng.       Although Liang Dong was unhappy in his heart, he had to pretend to be enthusiastic on his face. In Leng Feng's opinion, he couldn't help but laugh secretly in his heart. This was deliberate by Leng Feng, he knew that Liang Dong was pretending, so let's see how far he could pretend.       I have to say that Liang Dong's alcohol consumption is really good, except for Leng Feng, who pretends to be drunk, he is the most sober.       In addition to Leng Feng, the five scholars who came with Master Xuedao also received special attention. Due to their special status, everyone naturally attaches importance to them, and being valued at the wine table means drinking more. Several scholars in Linjiang City, under the leadership of Liang Dong, can be said to have played extraordinarily this time, and the four of them defeated six people, including Leng Feng.       However, Leng Feng is pretending, if he plays, then the people at this table may fall.       Just when everyone was drunk and hazy, the little guy brought up with a jar of wine in one hand. The two maids continued to pour wine for Leng Feng and the others with the melodious sound of the piano coming from the bow of the boat.       "Come on, we won't get drunk tonight!" After the wine was refilled, Liang Dong stood up and said loudly.       At this moment, he was also a little unstable, and his tongue became bigger, but this aura was even greater. People of this age are at the time of their youth and vigor, and as a scholar, they deliberately maintain their state, but they don't care about these at this moment.       Everyone is on the flower boat, and the boat is in the middle of the river, there are no other people around, and all the wine is on the head, no one will easily say no at this time.       So, in the midst of a drunken voice, everyone raised their wine bowls again.       When Leng Feng took a sip of wine, his heart couldn't help but move. He immediately felt that this time the wine was different from the previous drink, and there were other things mixed in the drink.       "Hmm!"       The Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Body Divine Skills not only temper the physical body, which can make the body stronger, but also make the body more sensitive.       After Leng Feng's body has been cultivated by the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Divine Skill, he already has a self-protection ability, as long as he senses that a substance or danger harmful to his body is approaching, he will immediately decompose or eliminate it. It is also a basic skill of the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons to forge their bodies.       Although Leng Feng's Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demon Forging Divine Skills at this time could only be regarded as barely getting started, what was in the wine was not highly poisonous, but a drug similar to a neurotoxin, which was very similar to the hallucinogenic agent in modern society. After drinking this drug, it can cause some hallucinations and even more excitement.       Leng Feng could sense that not only him, but also several other people present, including Liang Dong, also contained this medicinal ingredient in their drinks.       Through Leng Feng's observation, it is now possible to determine the role played by Liang Dong in this matter. In this matter, Liang Dong is definitely involved, but the degree of mixing is not deep. Even Liang Dong didn't know what Leng Feng's second uncle was going to do, and he didn't know that the little guy on the boat was the killer arranged by the second uncle.In this matter, Liang Dong is only a tool man at best, and he is only an object to be used in the entire plan of the second uncle.       The role that Liang Dong can play is to invite Leng Feng and a few people to have a drink.       After all, in the eyes of Leng Feng's two uncles, the fewer people who know about this kind of thing, the safer, Liang Dong is just a junior in their eyes, and he is not necessarily reliable.       Leng Feng guessed correctly, before this, it was indeed his second uncle who signaled Liang Dong to have a good relationship with several other scholars who were also in the top ten, especially the five children of the family who came with Master Xuedao. and gave Liang Dong a sum of money as the activity fund for the cage relationship, so there was today's banquet.       "Ah, someone overboard!"       As the lights on the flower boat dimmed, a woman's scream was heard. The woman playing the piano at the bow of the boat was also disgraced, and she stood on the bow of the boat to hide her face and exclaimed.       It turned out that just now, several scholars in the cabin suddenly laughed and jumped, some knocked over the cups and plates on the table, and some hugged the maid who was pouring them wine and kissed and nibbled. These maids are not those women who sell their bodies in the Qinglou, although they are people in the Fengyue Field, but they have not experienced that kind of training, and it is normal for them to be frightened and scream when they are suddenly attacked by this kind of attack.       At this time, these scholars seemed to be obsessed, and completely threw their polite image out of the sky. Somehow, the lights in the cabin were turned off, and then there was a staggering sound.       Then there was a scream, and there was a few thudding sounds of falling water.       At this time, it was already night, and although there was half a moon in the sky, the vision was still affected, and it was not clear who had fallen into the water.       On the Linjiang River, there are not only this flower boat that Liang Dong has taken over, but there are more than a dozen flower boats distributed on the river. However, everyone is far away from each other, after all, the people who contract the flower boat are all privacy-conscious, no matter how good you are on the boat, others don't know.       Therefore, the movement on this flower boat did not attract the attention of others at the first time.       Among the people who fell into the water, Leng Feng naturally also included, but he fell on purpose.       Just now, the little guy suddenly bumped into him, Leng Feng pretended to be without resistance, and plunged into the water with a frightened face. Before falling into the water, he could clearly see the sneering expression on the little guy's face.       The moonlight was hazy at night, and there was a sudden change, and many people had dark eyes at this moment. It was the killer, his vision was also affected, and he only saw Leng Feng's figure falling into the water, as for Leng Feng's performance, he didn't see it clearly at all.       But Leng Feng could clearly see everything around him, and it would be easy for him to dodge the collision just now. But Leng Feng also clearly knew that he couldn't solve any problems by dodging this one, only deliberately falling into the water to lure the other party into the bait, and then solving the other party in the water.       Although this will not completely solve the trouble, at least no one will bother him for a short time.This is the grasp of the situation and mentality, Leng Feng clearly knows what kind of situation he is in, and he will not imagine that others can take the initiative to let him go. At the same time, I also know that blindly avoiding is not a solution, and things are solved, not avoided.       In this chaotic scene, the killer was eliminated, as long as Leng Feng did not reveal his strength for a day, then others would not know how the killer died. Correspondingly, those who want to do something to Leng Feng must think about it. In this way, the cold front has a quiet time.       Sure enough, it was about the same as Leng Feng expected, just after everyone fell into the water for a few breaths, the lights on the boat were lit again. With the smoke wafting from the wick, everyone's heads seemed to be awake.       In fact, this smoke is not simple, it is the hallucinogen antidote that was placed in the wine glass before.       The killer was carefully arranged, not only to create a situation where the cold front died by accident, but also to make others go through the danger. At the same time, let them be witnesses who can prove that it was just an accident.       Everything was a success, and finally it was time to close the net.       "Quick, save people!"       "Brother Wang, it's overboard!"       "Brother Li also fell into the water!"       Suddenly, everyone who reacted found that the people around them were gone, and two of them were the five children of the family.       "Brother Leng, Brother Leng! Won't you fall overboard! ”
       At this time, someone finally discovered that Leng Feng was gone.       However, everyone was in a mess, and although they saw someone in the water constantly splashing, they didn't know who was who. Moreover, all the scholars are landlubbers, and no one knows how to swim, so naturally they dare not go into the water to save people.       On this boat, only the little guy and the boatman knew how to water, so the two jumped into the water. Others don't know the location and identity of the person who fell into the water, but the little guy knows it very well.       Especially for the location where the cold front fell into the water, it was deliberately arranged by him, and the position where the cold front fell into the water was the farthest away from the flower boat. In fact, the three scholars who fell into the water were all knocked down by him, and the force of the impact was not the same.       The two of them were trying to attract everyone's attention, but they were hit by him near the flower boat, and Leng Feng was knocked out by him for a long time.       Of course, saving people must start from close first, the boatman knows nothing, and those who are engaged in their profession also have a certain work ethic. They don't care about what happens on the ship, they just take care of the boat. Of course, in this kind of situation, when a guest falls overboard, they are also saved.       The boatman swam towards the two men who were close to the flower boat, while the little guy swam in the direction of the cold front. Because the boat was not controlled by anyone, it fluttered gently on the water, and although the evening breeze at this time was not strong, it happened to drift in the opposite direction of the person who fell into the water.       Although the boat did not move fast, it added extra trouble to the rescue. However, this is a rare opportunity for both the killer and the cold front.       In the eyes of the killer, this is a good time to solve the target, and killing Leng Feng underwater is simply unaware. From the known intelligence, it seems that Leng Feng can't water, and he was almost drowned two days ago, and this time drowning is simply providence.For Leng Feng, the same is true, when he moves underwater, he is naturally not afraid of others seeing it.       The killer's underwater skills are very good, and after entering the water, he burrows into the water like a swimming fish. At this time, Leng Feng was still splashing in the distance, and it looked as if it was about to sink.       A figure submerged in the water, quietly came to Leng Feng's underneath, and suddenly stretched out his hands to clasp Leng Feng's ankle and pulled it down. A string of splashes appeared on the surface of the water, and Leng Feng's body sank into the water.       The man in the water could see the look of horror and struggle on Leng Feng's face, and the man smiled.       Leng Feng's performance was exactly the same as the information he had received before. Maybe he felt that such a goal was really not challenging, or maybe his patience was exhausted, so he decided to kill Leng Feng directly, and turned around and pinched Leng Feng's neck with both hands.       Just as he approached Leng Feng, he suddenly saw that the panic and struggle on Leng Feng's face was gone, replaced by a smile of unknown meaning. Seeing Leng Feng's expression change, his heart suddenly fluttered, and a sense of uneasiness came to his heart, and he subconsciously wanted to speed up his movements.       However, at this time, it was too late for him to feel that something was wrong, because a huge pain had already come from the Qi Sea Dantian.       It turned out that just as he was getting close to Leng Feng, Leng Feng's palm had already taken the first step and was fiercely imprinted on his Qi Sea Dantian.       Although both were underwater, their movements seemed unaffected. This person is a killer, and his underwater kung fu is indeed good, and it seems that this person eats mixed rice on the water. However, Leng Feng is also unaffected underwater, the innate divine skill can allow him to stay underwater for a long time without breathing, and the twelve heavenly gods and demons can also make the body suitable for various special places.       Therefore, the combat effectiveness of the cold front underwater is no worse than that on the shore.       These are not the most deadly, after all, Leng Feng's strength at this time is not higher than this killer. The most critical point is that due to the killer's miscalculation, he thought that Leng Feng was still the Leng Dashao before, and he could easily let him handle it.       It was under such a calculated and unintentional situation that Leng Feng's easy sneak attack was successful, and he had a beautiful counterattack. After the dantian qi sea was hit, it was like a ball full of gas breaking a hole, and the strength of the whole body disappeared in an instant.       The killer's eyes widened suddenly, and his eyelies were filled with horror and incredulity.       "Gollum!" It took a few mouthfuls of water before the man came to his senses.       However, at this time, the situation had been reversed, and his legs were grabbed by Leng Feng. was already under the water, and after the dantian was broken, all the skills of the body disappeared. Before, this person relied on cultivating special methods to ventilate underwater, but now this ability has disappeared, and he wants to struggle and resist, but he can't raise any strength in his body.       In this way, Leng Feng pulled his feet and dragged this person to the bottom of the river, and then wrapped the aquatic grass at the bottom of the river around his body.       Leng Feng was very decisive and fast when he did this. Although it was borrowed from Leng Dashao's body, the instinct that had been tempered by life and death in his previous life was not lost at all.       Kindness to the enemy is cruelty to oneself, Leng Feng understands this truth.       In April, many aquatic plants have grown on the bottom of the river, which are thin, long, and resilient. Soon this person was entangled like a rice dumpling by Leng Feng with water weeds, and after some struggle, in less than two breaths, this person's eyes completely turned white, and there was no longer a trace of movement.In this world, Leng Feng completed his first kill!       It can be said that this man died quite unjustly. Originally, with his ability, he should still be slightly above the cold front. However, after being attacked by Leng Feng's sneak attack, he instantly lost the ability to fight back and became a fish to be slaughtered.       At this time, Leng Feng's heart was also secretly lucky. If the two fight face-to-face under normal circumstances, it is not certain who will die in the end. This also reminded Leng Feng that he could not be negligent at any time, the lion and the rabbit still used all his strength, and he must be careful of capsizing in the gutter at any time.       With a bang, the cold front came out of the water and fluttered on the surface of the river again.       "Quick! Get closer to that side! On the flower boat not far away, someone saw Leng Feng's movement and immediately shouted loudly.       By this time, the two drowning men had been rescued by the boatman, and were lying on the plank of the bow of the boat like dead dogs.       The boatman, a very experienced man, reached the two men with a bamboo pole in his hand, asked one of them to grab one end of the bamboo pole, and then dragged them to the boat. The whole process only took a few breaths.       Although it wasn't a long time, what others would never have imagined was that in the time of these few breaths, there was an underwater fight between a kill and a counterattack on Leng Feng's side. The process seems simple, but every step is calculated, and it is not an exaggeration to describe it as thrilling.       What no one knew was that under the water, there was a figure tightly entangled in aquatic plants, and it had completely lost signs of life. Presumably, it will not be long before this aquatic plant will grow even more luxuriantly.       The flower boat, under the control of the boatman, soon came to Leng Feng's side. Only then did everyone see Leng Feng's appearance clearly, and his hair was scattered, looking very embarrassed.       "Quick, Brother Leng, grab the bamboo pole!" As the boatman stretched out the bamboo pole towards Leng Feng, someone on the boat shouted at Leng Feng.       Leng Feng knew that the play should end at this time, so in the shouts of everyone, Leng Feng was also pulled onto the bow of the boat. In order to make this scene more realistic, Leng Ye, like the two companions who fell into the water, lay on the bow of the boat for a while, and spit a few mouthfuls of water.       Now, everyone's Yaxing is gone. Although there was no major incident, the process was also quite thrilling, where did these scholars experience this kind of battle, and most of them had the intention of returning.       "It was a happy thing, but I didn't expect such an accident! It's all poorly arranged, and I hope you all have it. Especially Brother Wang, Brother Li and Brother Leng, if there is any mistake, I will not be able to forgive myself in the future! ”
       Liang Dong clasped his fists and saluted everyone, and even bent down to Leng Feng and the three to plead guilty.       Not to mention anything else, whether he is hypocritical or fake, even Liang Dong's attitude has also added a lot of points to him. In the eyes of others, he is not to blame for this incident, but to blame everyone for being drunk and disorderly, and losing his talents.       And Liang Dong's behavior of taking the initiative to admit his mistakes and attributing all the responsibility to himself seems to be a gentleman.       "It has nothing to do with Brother Liang, it's just an accident!"       "That's true, how can you blame Brother Liang for this!"       "Even so, we can be regarded as sharing the suffering! The so-called friends of distress are nothing more than that! ”
Sure enough, no one blamed Liang Dong for this anymore. There are even people who have made friends in trouble, and it seems that no matter where they are, there are talents.       After saying this, some people really think that this is the case.       "Accident!" Leng Feng pursed his lips silently. These scholars still seem to be very naïve, or they deliberately want to avoid the previous ugly scene.       "Huh! What about Huang Er? The boat started moving, and the boatman realized that the little man who was in charge of the vegetables was gone.       It turned out that this person's surname was Huang, the second in line, and everyone called him Huang Er. Since Leng Feng was not familiar with him, he naturally didn't pay much attention to this person, but now when he heard the boatman say this, he found that the person seemed to be gone.       Everyone also saw him jump into the water to save people before, but the environment was chaotic at that time, and Huang Er deliberately avoided everyone's sight after entering the water, so everyone didn't think much about it.       "Brother Leng, have you ever seen that person?" Someone looked at Leng Feng and asked.       Because there were only three people who fell into the water here, those two were rescued by the boatman at the first time. It stands to reason that if Huang Er also dived to save people, he should have gone to Leng Feng.       "Except for this old brother who pulled me here with a bamboo pole, I didn't see anyone else!"       Leng Feng was already around the stove at this time, just like the two scholars who fell into the water, and when he heard someone asking, he immediately replied without thinking. To others, Leng Feng's answer seemed natural.       Since no one saw the man, where did he go? After all, this is a big living person, can't he disappear out of thin air? In this way, it was a long search, but unfortunately no trace could be found.       In this way, it tossed for nearly half an hour, only to exhaust everyone's patience.       Fortunately, Huang Er is just a small guy, and he is not familiar with everyone, and the only boatman who knows him only knows that this person came here from other places to make a living. Human life is worthless in this era, let alone a person with no background.       No one suspected that Huang Er's disappearance had something to do with Leng Feng, after all, all this was arranged by Huang Er himself. This is called digging a pit and burying himself, which is really sad to open the door for the sad urge, and the sad urge to get home.       After deciding not to look for it any longer, the boat soon docked, and when this happened, everyone lost the interest in continuing the meeting, so they dispersed.       Leng Feng did not stay in the city, but rode a thin horse and rushed out of the city. At this time, there was no curfew in Linjiang City, but it was not easy for ordinary people to get out of the city. However, Leng Feng is no longer what it used to be, and the news that Leng Dashao won the top spot in the selection test has spread almost all over the city.       The gatekeepers of Linjiang City all knew Leng Dashao, and even knew that Lord Xuedao had met Leng Dashao alone today. What's more, Leng Dashao didn't go out of the city in the middle of the night before, and many gatekeepers in Linjiang City had received his silver.       In today's situation, it is not difficult for Leng Dashao to get out of the city.       It seems that there is still a certain amount of truth in Leng Dashao's preference for using silver to open the way before.       The moon is bright tonight, and the city is very quiet. Most of the roads of this era were dirt roads that had been trodden on, and if there was no moon, the black lights would not be passable at all. This is also the reason why the ancients did not rush at night, but fortunately there is a moon tonight.Hongshan Village is not too far from Linjiang City, and it is only three or five miles after crossing the moat.       Leng Feng has never been afraid to walk at night, and in his previous life, as the king of special forces, Leng Feng could lurk alone in the deserted jungles and mountains for several days. Isn't it just a night walk in such an environment now! There was no difficulty at all for him.       However, just as Leng Feng came to the edge of the moat, he saw an old carriage parked there. Leng Feng recognized at a glance that the carriage belonged to their family, and it was Chai Bo who drove the carriage.       In addition to Chai Bo, there is also a simple and honest boy who is black and strong. This young man is still a year younger than Leng Feng, but his figure is half a head taller than Leng Feng. I don't know how he grew up, and when he was hungry for half a year, he developed so strongly.       This made Leng Feng come to a noun: strange people! It seems that this Ah Hu belongs to this type of person, and he may be born with extraordinary talents. Such people are unusual, the previous Leng Dashao only knew that he was very angry, and adult men were not his opponents.       The boy's name is Ah Hu, and because he is a countryman and has not read any books, he has not taken an official name.       However, Ah Hu is very honest and honest, since Leng Feng's family moved to Hongshan Village, Ah Hu's family has become Leng Feng's long-term worker. They do a lot of hard work at home, they never cheat and cheat, and they get along well with Leng Feng's family.       Moreover, Ah Hu is also the blacksmith descendant of Hongshanzhuang, and after the old blacksmith left, he did all the ironwork in Zhuangzi.       Today, before Leng Feng went to the banquet, he had already sent someone to the Leng family's house to inform his mother. Leng Li was worried that something would happen to Leng Feng, so he asked Chai Bo to take Ah Hu and wait by the moat early.       It was here that Leng Feng fell into the water three days ago, which already made Leng Li have a shadow here.       "Young Master, this way!" Chai Bo waved the lantern in his hand at Leng Feng.       "Young Master Feng!" Ah Hu also shouted honestly.       "Chai Bo, Ah Hu!" Leng Feng also greeted them.       At this time, Leng Feng's clothes were already dry, and since it was April, the weather was already a little hot, so he only wore a long shirt. After being fished onto the flower boat, he did not be as reserved as the other scholars, but took off his clothes and wrung out the excess water. In addition, after roasting by the stove for a while, it was almost dry, and now it has been completely dried by the wind.       At this time, in Chai Bo's opinion, Leng Feng could no longer see that he had fallen into the water.       "Young master, Madam is worried that you will come back late, so I asked Ah Hu and I to wait for you here." Chai Bo waited until Leng Feng walked over and said.       Leng Dashao in the past, although he also had the experience of sneaking out of the city, but after all, it was different from now. At that time, Leng Da Rich was still in Linjiang City, and no one dared to have any crooked thoughts about Leng Da Shao.       But now it's different, the Leng family has such a huge industry there, and many people's eyes are staring at this cake. Once Leng Dashao has some accidents, then these properties of the Leng family will be swallowed up immediately, and there will be no scum left.       After falling into the water three days ago, Leng Li felt a little wrong in his heart. After all, Leng Dashao has passed the small bridge outside the city more than once, but he has never had an accident before, why did he happen to fall into the water this time?Since the situation of Leng Feng falling into the water was just an accident in the eyes of everyone in the water, Leng Li was not sure that someone had caused it to be bad. However, he still paid attention to Leng Feng's safety.       Leng Feng looked at this small wooden bridge and felt a lot of emotion for a while. It can be said that this place is of great significance to him, if Leng Dashao did not fall into the water here, then there would be no cold front in this world. Perhaps, Leng Feng's soul will still pass over, but it may not be able to fall on Leng Dashao's body.       It can be said that this providence has its own certainty in the dark!       "Young Master Feng, the horse will lead me to the horse, you can go back in the carriage!"       Just as Leng Feng was slightly distracted, Ah Hu also walked to his side and grabbed the reins of the thin horse.       Leng Feng did not refuse, although the carriage of this era was not comfortable to sit on, but it was still more comfortable than riding a horse at night.       "Well, thank you very much!" Leng Feng turned over and dismounted, waved his hand to Ah Hu and said.       "Hey, hey!"       Ah Hu scratched his head embarrassedly, he didn't speak much, and felt that it was normal for him to lead Leng Feng. Ah Hu had a lot of contact with Leng Dashao before, but today I feel that Leng Dashao seems to be different from before. But he couldn't tell what the difference was, he just felt that Leng Dashao gave people a very friendly feeling.       An old carriage, an elderly coachman, and a sturdy young man leading a lean horse. None of the group spoke again, walking on the country road under the moonlit night, the combination was very strange, but Leng Feng felt a different artistic conception.       This may only be experienced in this era! There is no hustle and bustle, and there is no tense rhythm, the four fields are empty, and the night breeze is cool.       In less than half an hour, Leng Feng returned to the Leng family's mansion again. Leng Feng didn't tell Leng Li about his falling into the water, after all, saying it only increased their worries, and there was no substantial benefit.       Seeing Leng Feng return safely, the family went back to rest with peace of mind. The little girls have already slept, and only Fluttershy is still fighting with her upper and lower eyelids, waiting for Leng Feng to return.       Seeing this, Leng Feng touches her brain and tells her to go back to sleep, after all, Fluttershy is only a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl. Girls at this age are at the time of physical development, and lack of sleep will affect development.       The Leng family house is quiet tonight, after all, the excitement like yesterday is just the exception. In this day and age, people have become accustomed to the tradition of going to bed after dark. Especially in the countryside, there are many families who don't even have lights, and what can they do if they don't sleep when it's dark, which is also the reason why there are many children in the countryside.       Back in his room, Leng Feng first practiced the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Body Forging Divine Skill for nearly a pillar of incense, and then fell tired on the ground again. Although as long as he practiced this exercise, he was tired on the ground, but Leng Feng could clearly feel that every time he was tired, it was worth it.       He could feel that his body had become stronger again, and the special strength in his body had also thickened a little.       After his previous experience underwater, Leng Feng could clearly feel the power of this special force. He was able to stay in the water without being affected, and that strength worked a lot. Moreover, when he slapped on the killer's dantian, he also used this force to rush into the opponent's dantian, completely disintegrating the energy in the opponent's dantian.       Without this kind of strength, he would not have been able to fight back and kill.Seeing the benefits and sense of security brought by strong strength, Leng Feng will definitely not relax, no matter what happens, he must practice the exercises every day. Moreover, the practice of the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Divine Skills will not take a lot of time, but it is important to persevere.       With Leng Feng's current physique, he has already reached the limit by practicing once a day in the morning and evening. It is useless to practice too much, because his body simply can't bear it.       After relieving himself, Leng Feng began to practice the second exercise. This time, when he cultivated the Innate Divine Skill, he didn't have the feeling he had yesterday. The innate state is hard to find, Leng Feng was able to enter that state yesterday, and he himself can't tell what's going on.       It's best to be able to enter that state, after all, Leng Feng has felt the taste of it, and that kind of coolness can't be described in words. However, even in a normal state, the effect of cultivating innate divine skills is better than the quality of sleep.       Moreover, this exercise is not only achieved by hard cultivation, but also depends on one's talent and comprehension ability.       Leng Feng felt that he was not bad in both aspects, and through his cultivation last night, it could be seen that he was very suitable for cultivating this divine skill. It seems that after he crossed over, his soul combined with Leng Dashao's body, resulting in a qualitative change similar to a chemical reaction. Recently, Leng Feng can find from time to time that this body will give him some surprises.       The cold family's mansion was shrouded in night, and it seemed quiet and peaceful. But in Linjiang City, the house of Second Master Leng is shrouded in a different atmosphere.       Second Master Leng and Third Master Leng were still sitting facing each other, and there was a man in black standing beside them. This person's face was stiff, revealing a cold aura all over his body, of course, the most attractive thing was his palms, which looked a lot larger than ordinary people's palms. And every joint is unusually thick, and the entire palm of the hand looks like dead tree bark.       But anyone who practices martial arts, when they see these palms, knows that this person's kung fu should be very powerful.       "My brother is doing things for you, but now you can't tell his whereabouts, don't think that our brothers of the five ghosts of the Yellow River are so easy to fool!"       It turned out that this person was the eldest brother of the killer who was killed by Leng Feng. These five ghosts of the Yellow River are five brothers, who grew up by the Yellow River since they were children, and their water nature is excellent. It is said that they once received the guidance of a master who was also proficient in water kung fu, and a pair of iron palms were also famous in the rivers and lakes.       "The Yellow Hall Master is angry, no matter how bold we are, we don't dare to deceive the Iron Master. We also inquired about the situation at the time, and it was indeed an accident, as for where the brother of the Yellow Hall Master went, we really don't know! ”
       Although Second Master Leng is scheming, he is still very jealous in the face of this Yellow Hall Master. After all, these people in the rivers and lakes sometimes don't reason with you at all. If you can't satisfy them, in anger, whoever you are is likely to kill you with a knife.       If that's the case, it's just too wrong.       "Are you sure!" The person known as the Yellow Hall Master still said with a blank face.       Second Master Leng and Third Master Leng could clearly feel that the cold murderous aura in this person's words seemed to have a lot of lives on this person's hands."If the Huang Hall Master is not at ease, I can call the nephew of the insider, he organized the wine party at that time, you can ask him personally." Second Master Leng said.       "Alright, you call him!" It seems that Hall Master Huang is still skeptical of Second Master Leng's answer.       So, after a while, Liang Dong appeared here. It seems that Second Master Leng had expected this step a long time ago, and asked Liang Dong to wait here in advance.       Liang Dong didn't know about Second Master Leng's arrangement, and he didn't know what Second Master Leng also called him. But Liang Dong is also a smart person, he knows that everything in his family is obtained through Leng Erye, since Leng Erye asked him to cooperate with this person's inquiry, then Liang Dong also knows everything and says everything.       Liang Dong replied very truthfully, and he didn't say anything about the situation at that time.       Hall Master Huang had been listening to Liang Dong's narration expressionlessly, and did not interrupt during the period. After listening, he asked Liang Dong about the specific situation of everyone on the ship at that time. Liang Dong also told this person one by one according to his own understanding.       After listening to Liang Dong's story, Hall Master Huang didn't say anything more. Because the situation was basically consistent with what he knew, he waved his hand and let Liang Dong leave.       Although Liang Dong was confused, he also knew that this person must have come for the little guy who disappeared on the flower boat today. However, Liang Dong didn't take this matter to heart, after all, he was not a person in a circle, so he naturally didn't know the relevant secrets in that circle.       But Liang Dong also had some doubts in his heart, and this suspicion was mainly aimed at Second Master Leng. Although Liang Dong didn't know Second Master Leng 's thoughts and plans, after going through this incident, he found that Second Master Leng seemed to be too attentive to Leng Feng. Thinking of what Second Master Leng said to him before, it seems that Second Master Leng let himself have a banquet for Leng Feng and the others, and his real purpose may not be as he said.       After all, Liang Dong is a smart person, he didn't think about this before, but now that he has doubts, he naturally finds some clues.       When he came back just now, he also told Second Master Leng about it. Because before this, Second Master Leng had said that if he talked to him after the banquet, he could help Liang Dong with his staff. At that time, Liang Dong really thought that Second Master Leng was trying to help him pull connections, but now it seems that there may be another reason for this.       It can be seen from the performance of Second Master Leng asking him about the situation that Second Master Leng does not really care about the communication situation of the banquet, and he cares too much about Leng Feng.       He Liang Dong is very clear about the relationship between Second Master Leng and Leng Feng, although he is an uncle and nephew, Second Master Leng has never regarded Leng Feng as a nephew. So, why does he care so much about Leng Feng, is it because Leng Feng has won the top spot, and there is hope for them to glorify the Leng family?       This may be able to deceive people who don't know the inside story, but at least he Liang Dong won't believe it.       Thinking of the Leng family's property dispute, Liang Dong had never thought about it before, and there was already a faint guess in his heart at this time. Although Liang Dong had already guessed, he didn't plan to delve into it, he knew that this kind of thing should not be mixed in.       After all, no matter how Leng Feng's uncle and nephew fight, it was only an internal matter of the Leng family. And he, Liang Dong, is an outsider, once this matter leaks out, Second Master Leng may be fine, but he Liang Dong will definitely be fine.Liang Dong frowned, and left the Leng family's mansion thoughtfully. Looking at the mansion shrouded in darkness, he felt inexplicably depressed in his heart, and he already had a hint of jealousy here.       The matter on Second Master Leng's side has not yet been resolved, and that Huang Hall Master has not gotten the result he wants, so he naturally will not give up easily.       "My brother can't disappear for no reason, you have to give an explanation for this, and double the price agreed before. If I find out that this is related to you, then it's not just about the price! Master Huang said in a calm tone.       "The price is easy to say! Please also rest assured that Hall Master Huang, I can guarantee that we have absolutely nothing to do in this matter! After finishing speaking, he turned to Leng Sanye and said, "Third brother, give the reward to the Huang Hall Master!" ”
       When Leng Sanye heard this, he immediately took out a money bag from his arms and handed it to the Huang Hall Master. The hall master Huang pinched it with his hand, knowing that there were a few gold bars here, he quietly put them away.       "Is your nephew really a piece of rubbish?" After collecting the gold bars, Hall Master Huang's tone softened a little. It seems that no matter who you are, you can't take the power of money ability lightly.       "This is also what I think is strange, what kind of virtue my nephew is, I must have heard of it in the Yellow Hall Master. He almost drowned in the water just three days ago, so we asked your cousin's brother to help him in the same way.       According to what we know about her, even if the eldest lady scatters all her wealth, she may not be able to exchange it for a fame. But who would have thought that he would win the top spot in this selection test, if there is nothing in this that we don't know, it is absolutely impossible! ”
       Second Master Leng directly expressed his doubts, and of course he didn't add fuel to the fire. After all, he also knew that this Huang Hall Master knew the situation in Linjiang City very well, and he only had to tell the real situation, coupled with some of his own doubts, he would naturally be able to provoke the Huang Hall Master's suspicion of Leng Feng.       Once the Yellow Hall Master became suspicious of Leng Feng, then it was very likely that the Yellow Hall Master would be able to kill Leng Feng without having to do it himself.       "I know what you're saying, but I don't think your nephew has the ability to kill my brother without knowing it, the only explanation ......"       At this point, Hall Master Huang paused, glanced at the two of them, and saw the Leng family brother's face puzzled, he continued: "Even if there may be a master behind him, I will find out about this matter." No matter who it is, as long as I find out that it is not good for my brother, our Iron Palm Gang will definitely not give up! ”
       There is a master behind Leng Feng!       This point of view reminded Second Master Leng and Third Master Leng that they had never thought of this before, and they always thought that with Leng Feng's waste, how they wanted to clean it up was not how to clean it up.       So there is no sense of urgency to clean up the cold front. If it weren't for Leng Feng's performance in this selection test, they wouldn't have made such a hasty move.       "It's really possible!"       After hearing Hall Master Huang's words, the two of them almost thought of something in unison, and spoke at the same time.       "Think about my eldest brother, I have indeed been in contact with many strange people in the past, and it is inevitable that some people will remember the old love and secretly help my nephew."       "In any case, I won't let it go easily. If my brother is okay, if something happens, everyone involved in it will be buried with me! ”
After the Huang Hall Master put down this sentence, he turned around and left without any delay.       Seeing the back of the Huang Hall Master leaving, Second Master Leng and Third Master Leng glanced at each other, and there was an inexplicable smell flashing in their eyes.       "Borrow a knife to kill!" Four words came out of their mouths at the same time.       Of course, they also knew that Hall Master Huang's knife was not so easy to borrow. However, the risks are much smaller than if they were doing it themselves.       For the failure of this plan, Second Master Leng and Third Master Leng were not so angry compared to Hall Master Huang. After all, they only lost some money and did not expose themselves. There are still a few months left before the coronation of the cold front, and they think that in the meantime, they can find an opportunity to clean up the cold front.       As for why Leng Feng was able to win the top spot in the selection test, they don't delve into the reasons now. After all, this is only the top of Linjiang City, and it is difficult to say where Leng Feng can go in the future.       However, with their understanding of Leng Feng, their cognition is still stuck in the previous Leng Dashao's personality, and they are not optimistic that Leng Feng can make a difference on this road.       Besides, there is still a month before Leng Feng enters the Jingmian Saint. Take 10,000 steps back and say, even if Leng Feng suddenly becomes talented, the road to Beijing is not all smooth sailing. Although the current Southern Song Dynasty has not yet reached the level of war and chaos, the society is unstable, there are many bandits and horse thieves on the road, and it is normal for a few people to die.       Leng Feng can guess some of these people's reactions, this is what he wants, as long as he can win it for a while, he is not afraid of other people's calculations.       After a night of silence, Leng Feng got up early the next morning and repeated yesterday's exercise routine.       However, Leng Feng is not the only one who wakes up early today, Fluttershy, Leng Li and the others are all up early. Fluttershy, in particular, gets up almost one after the other.       The little girl was very curious at first and ran with Leng Feng for a while, but then gave up.       Leng Li was very pleased with Leng Feng's change, so when he was eating this morning, Leng Feng found that there was a big bowl of nourishing soup on the table.       It seems that they didn't take what Leng Feng said yesterday seriously. It's not that this thing has no effect, but the medicinal power of this tonic soup has little effect on Leng Feng's current physique.       In fact, cultivating the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Body Divine Skill requires great supplements to nourish the body. But with the Leng family's current ability, it was difficult to get that level of medicinal materials. Ordinary tonic medicines are only useful for ordinary people, and for Leng Feng, who is already barely getting started with body forging skills, the effect is too inferior.       The effect of his cultivation of the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Body Forging Divine Skill was much better than dozens of bowls of Great Tonic Soup. The so-called poor literature and rich martial arts are still very reasonable, after all, people at different levels of martial arts practice different things that need different supplements.       It is difficult for ordinary families to afford this kind of expenses, which is why only the families of high-ranking officials and dignitaries can afford to support martial artists.       Leng Feng also knew that in such a situation, his dissuasion might not necessarily be effective. Fortunately, the money that Leng Li had paid out at the beginning, except for the piece of jade in the hands of Lord Xuedao, was returned.Of course, there are reasons for this, but the main reason is that Leng Feng won the top spot in this selection test with his own strength. Let those who have benefited from the Leng family feel that taking the Leng family's things for nothing is a hot potato. So these things were sent back to Leng Li's hands through the hands of the mountain chief, which relieved the financial pressure on the Leng Feng family.       Anyway, this kind of big tonic soup is better than nothing, as long as they are happy, let them go!       Of course, Leng Feng also has a feeling of being cheap and well-behaved.       Today, Leng Feng decided not to go anywhere, the people who should have visited yesterday have all been visited, and as for the others, in Leng Feng's opinion, they are all people who tend to be inflammatory. I can't expect these people to be the icing on the cake, let alone to be able to help them.       Although he won the top spot in this selection test, Leng Feng didn't plan to be busy with various socializing lately like several others. In his opinion, this is a pure waste of time. Even if many people sent the greetings and invitations to the Leng family's house, they were all pushed away by Leng Feng.       It's not that Leng Feng doesn't understand the world, it's that he feels completely unnecessary. As long as you can maintain enough strength, these people will naturally respect you. If you don't have enough, just live like Leng Dashao before, it will be a joke in the eyes of others at most.       For these people who don't have many friendships, Leng Feng can naturally take care of the priorities.       "Feng'er, what are your plans for today?" After breakfast, Leng Li asked Leng Feng.       "It's okay, I'm going to stay home all the time lately!" Leng Feng replied.       Not only was Leng Li stunned by this, but everyone else was also stunned. This is not like Leng Dashao's style, Leng Dashao used to be an idle person, even if he lived in the countryside, he also liked to run around.       But thinking of the recent changes in Leng Feng, she was also relieved.       "It's okay if you don't go out!" Leng Yao was stunned for a moment, then said with a smile.       "Mother has one thing to tell you, now that you are almost crowned. One thing I have to tell you is that when you were just born, your father decided to do a family affair. ”
       So in Leng Feng's surprised gaze, Leng Li talked in detail about the baby kissing incident that Leng Da Rich Man had set for Leng Feng at the beginning.       “What？” After listening, Leng Feng's heart involuntarily popped up with this English word.       Such a bloody episode actually happened to him. In those cool articles in the previous life, don't write too much about this routine, almost many protagonists have experienced it. was first disgusted and looked down upon by the other party, and was even divorced, and then counterattacked all the way and turned over, slapping his face.       Almost instantly, countless shots flashed through Leng Feng's mind.       Leng Li naturally didn't understand what Leng Feng was thinking, and after seeing that after he finished speaking, Leng Feng's stunned appearance didn't give Leng Feng much time to reminisce but continued: "Originally, I planned to let you go to Jiankang Mansion now, after all, the Huang family is no longer what it used to be, if they can still remember the friendship of the past, they will naturally not treat you badly, it is better than staying here and not seeing hope."But I didn't expect my son to be so talented, and now I'm not so anxious. However, my mother still hopes that you can go to Jiankang Mansion before facing the saint, the status of the Huang family is there, and he is still very well connected in the imperial court.       In the past, you didn't have any fame, and you will inevitably be looked down upon in the past. But now it's different, the top of the selection test in Linjiang City, although it can't be compared with Jiankang Mansion. But with this layer of glory in you, presumably the master of the Huang family will also look down on you. ”
       Leng Lee's ideas can represent most of the mainstream ideas of this era. Only when a scholar is famous can he be called a person.       Leng Feng could understand Leng Li's thoughts, she wanted Leng Feng to go to Jingkang Mansion before, but in fact, she had no confidence in her heart, mainly she wanted Leng Feng to try her luck, and all the hopes were pinned on the Huang family's side to remember the affection of the year. Even if he doesn't recognize this marriage, he can still escort Leng Feng in accepting property.       After all, with the Huang family's ability now, if the other party could really help Leng Feng, absolutely no one would dare to say a word in this place in Linjiang City. Even Leng Feng's second and third uncles have 100,000 guts, and they don't dare to seek to seize the Leng family's property. After all, Huang Mingli can now be regarded as a feudal official, and the appointment and dismissal of officials in Linjiang City is not a matter of his words.       From this point of view, Leng Li is different from ordinary women after all, she has seen the world. also understands the truth that people die for money, and birds die for food, judging from the performance of the two uncles of the Leng family, she has understood that these two uncles will never hand over their property.       Why did Leng Feng fight with his two uncles! Only with the help of noble people can they support, and Huang Mingli is the lifesaver for their family.       To be honest, Leng Li is not stupid, she also knows that the Huang family has not contacted them for so many years, and she must have a different idea about the original family business. In fact, Leng Li's real idea was not to let Leng Feng go to propose, but to use the proposition as an introduction. The real purpose is to ask Huang Mingli to see the affection of the rich man at the beginning, and be able to keep their family's property.       However, she will not tell anyone about this, after all, there is no impermeable wall in the world, once Leng Feng's second and third uncles know her plans, they will definitely not let Leng Feng go to Jiankang Mansion alive.       But now the situation has changed, and she was not optimistic about Leng Feng's good performance in the selection test. The reason why he spent a lot of money to buy the relationship was to make a name for Leng Feng was also to make Leng Feng less embarrassed when he went to Jiankang Mansion.       Now Leng Feng has become the top of the selection test in Linjiang Mansion, and with the blessing of this identity, this has changed the mind in Leng Li's heart, maybe the old man of the Huang family will consider agreeing to the marriage contract of the year.       "And this?"       Turning his mind, Leng Feng had actually guessed Leng Li's thoughts. However, in order to be less obvious, he still asked deliberately.       Because Leng Feng found that Leng Li had ideas and was equally capable. After all, he is a dove occupying the magpie's nest, and if he overacts, it will not be good to arouse the suspicion of the other party.       "This is the marriage contract of the year, you take it and take a look!" Leng Li took out a marriage contract and handed it to Leng Feng.       After Leng Feng took it, he opened it and saw that it was indeed a marriage contract, and the people who signed the marriage contract were Huang Mingli and his father Leng Wuya.       After reading it, Leng Feng returned the marriage contract to Leng Li. To be honest, he really doesn't know what to say about this kind of thing. After all, he is not from this era, and his ideas are different from those of this era.In the era in which Leng Feng lived, he paid attention to the freedom of marriage, and this kind of marriage contract did not mean much in his opinion.       Even in this era, when the status of the parties is not equal, this kind of marriage contract is also not very effective. The spirit of contract has always been a joke in the face of money and status.       On this point, Leng Feng has seen far more thoroughly than the people of this era. If the status of the Huang family and their Leng family is at the same level, then this marriage contract is absolutely valid, after all, it is not as simple as saying it casually.       In the case of the wrong door, this kind of thing is just a joke. To be honest, Leng Feng was not interested in Leng Li's proposal.       "Mother, do you really plan for me to propose?"       Leng Feng knew that Leng Li wanted him to go to Jiankang Mansion to propose marriage, but he didn't want to go himself. First, not to mention the delay of time, and second, it is very likely to be self-inflicted humiliation in the past. If the Huang family really wanted to admit this family business, they would not have broken off contact with the Leng family over the years.       "I plan for you to go to Jiankang Mansion with a marriage contract and personally visit the master of the Huang family."       "But I don't want to go!" Leng Feng did not hesitate at this time, and directly refused. This is in line with Leng Dashao's previous personality, Leng Li glanced at Leng Feng and was not surprised.       However, she said with a smile: "With my son's current talent appearance, he can naturally be worthy of Miss Huang Family." ”
       Leng Feng pursed his lips and didn't say anything more. This is also what he is puzzled about, how can such a wise person as Leng Li be so indulgent in educating Leng Dashao!       Leng Feng is also very clear about what kind of virtue Leng Dashao used to be. Presumably, with Huang Mingli's current status, it is very easy to find out about the situation of the Leng family. Leng Dashao's glorious deeds may have been on people's desks a long time ago. This may be the key reason why the Huang family has cut off contact with the Leng family for so many years, after all, who would treat a young master who doesn't learn and doesn't know how to do it?       Seeing Leng Feng's lack of interest, Leng Li also frowned slightly. Based on his perception of his son, if Leng Feng heard the news, there would only be two reactions, one was arrogant, and the other was not concerned.       Although Leng Feng didn't care about it before, it was also in line with her perception of Leng Feng. But she really didn't expect that Leng Feng would be able to put on a serious thinking look.       This made Leng Li feel that Leng Feng was really different, to be precise, Leng Feng had changed since he fell into the water. However, Leng Li did not doubt Leng Feng's true identity, she thought that Leng Feng had really grown up after being stimulated by the overboard incident.       Leng Feng didn't know that his performance had caused Leng Li's conjecture like this, and if he knew, he would really be more restrained in front of Leng Li.       Leng Li looked left and right, and saw that the others were some distance away from their mother and son, so he lowered his voice and said: "Actually, the real purpose of my mother is not to have much expectation for this family business, but to let you take this marriage contract to meet the master of the Huang family." I will repair a letter for you to bring to him, and ask him to help you keep the inheritance left by the master for the sake of the situation.       As for this marriage contract, my mother also knows that there is a huge difference in the status of the two families now, and if they think it is inappropriate, we can give it up! ”


Hearing this, Leng Feng's expression was stunned, it seemed that he really underestimated Leng Li.       Most women in this era only know how to teach husbands and children, and they are dependent on men. Even if they are able to support themselves, they are only doing some hard work. But Leng Li's words today can see her vision and means.       It seems that there is a reason why Leng Li decisively moved out of Linjiang County with a large family and came to live in the countryside. It's not as simple as the outside world seems, after all, after the disappearance of the rich man Leng, almost all of the Leng family's industries were controlled by the second and third uncles.       If they don't evacuate Linjiang County and give up these industries for the time being, they will only face two consequences. One is to fight with the second uncle and the third uncle, and finally cause the Leng family to fall apart, and these industries will be divided by others. Another result is that their family, the old and weak, will disappear from this world one after another in the competition for property, and in the end, there may be no one left.       As for keeping the family business firmly in their hands, this possibility is almost non-existent.       It was under such circumstances that Leng Li decisively chose to avoid it for the time being. Even if they take 10,000 steps back, they will not be able to get back those industries in the end, and they can survive with these fields in the countryside. Leng Li is a person who knows how to make trade-offs, and the most important thing is to temporarily give up those industries to keep this big family.       After understanding this, Leng Feng discovered that Leng Li's foresight, and even he suspected that Leng Li's previous doting on Leng Dashao had an element of deliberate so. The purpose is also to paralyze others and relax their vigilance against the cold front.       But it's a pity that although Leng Li is very capable, she didn't participate in the management of the family industry when Leng Da Rich was still there. Therefore, there is no power and connections in the hands, which leads to the current passive situation.       "Okay, I'll go to Jiankang Mansion in two days."       After understanding Leng Li's true plan, Leng Feng knew that he had to go. At the same time, this is also a good opportunity for him to gain a foothold in this world, and only by taking advantage of the situation can he fly higher in a short time.       "Okay, anyway, there is still plenty of time now, so it doesn't hurt to go in two days, you can rest first in these two days."       Then, Leng Li chatted with Leng Feng for a while about the past of Huang Leng's two families, and then left.       It's already April, and although it's not the busy farming season, silkworm farming has been prevalent in Linjiang City since ancient times. The Leng family is also a large silkworm breeder, which is the biggest source of income for the Leng family at present.       Leng Dashao is the only one in the family who never cares about this, and Fluttershy also takes her sisters to help pick mulberry leaves.       In the past, Leng Dashao was not divided into grains and limbs, but now Leng Feng has no heart to pay attention to these. Fortunately, everyone is used to being cold, and no one cares what he does.       For the current Leng Feng, the first thing is to improve his strength. Although he solved the killer yesterday, Leng Feng understood that there was an element of luck in this.       If the other party arranges someone to assassinate him next time, whether the other party is suspicious of him or not, the killer's strength may be higher. He has now cultivated two exercises, only to increase the strength of his body, and his real combat power is not high, as long as a third-rate master comes, he can completely torture and kill.The improvement of strength requires a process, and being able to obtain these cultivation methods of supreme divine skills is already a great opportunity. As for the legendary kind of heaven and earth treasure that can make people strong day by day, Leng Feng will not have illusions about it now, and it is better to be down-to-earth.       So I had to start from the other side of improving my strength and make some weapons for self-defense.       In this era, the control of swords was not so strict, and the only weapons listed as controlled by the imperial court were bows and arrows and armor, so it was common to see people carrying swords on the streets, but it was rare to see people holding bows and arrows and wearing armor. These things are only available to the army of the imperial court.       However, the current Southern Song Dynasty court does not have strong control over the place, and people with a little privilege can have bows and arrows and armor.       If Leng Feng wants to develop his power, he can't do without these two things. But it wasn't these two things that he was going to make now, but weapons that could now make up for his strength to a great extent.       In his previous life, Leng Feng was a master with a dagger, and once used a dagger to kill dozens of enemies in combat. And those enemies are not general, and several of them are also the kings of the enemy country.       In fact, Leng Feng's favorite is still guns, but with the technology of this era, he is not sure that he can build guns. Making guns is not only about technology, but also about materials, and with the level of science and technology in this era, it is difficult to get qualified materials.       Not to mention the rest, even springs may not be able to be made.       In fact, there were already muskets in this era, but the muskets were not very powerful, and they were also very troublesome to use. The muskets of this era belonged to the early breech guns, and it took a lot of effort to load gunpowder or pressure bullets, and they were not even as powerful as bows and arrows. Once it encounters rainy weather, this gun is like a burning stick, so the gun of this era is a chicken rib.       Leng Feng also dislikes this gun, and his goal is to build a large revolver first.       In his previous life, Leng Feng studied in a military academy for several years before he became the king of special combat teams, and his specialty was weapon manufacturing. And Leng Feng also has a nostalgic complex, and he likes all kinds of weapons in World War I and World War II, especially all kinds of revolvers and Mauser pistols, and he has a lot of collections.       Many people may not have heard of the Mauser pistol, but when it comes to his other name, almost everyone knows it, that is, the famous barge gun, also known as the Wang Ba box.       The production of these two pistols is relatively simple, and under the existing conditions it is possible to do it by hand alone. However, the most difficult thing is the bullet, and it is the most difficult to make it by hand.       Fortunately, Leng Feng has a very thorough understanding of the manufacturing principles of firearms and bullets, and as long as he has time in the future, he will definitely be able to figure out these two pistols. However, it is obvious that the time is not enough, and the next best thing is to make repeaters.       Although the power of the repeater is not as good as that of a pistol, it is considered advanced in this era. In this era, there were already crossbow arrows, but crossbow arrows have not yet left the category of bows and arrows, and most of them are bows and arrows with a handle and firing device.The repeating crossbow to be made by Leng Feng is a special operations crossbow composed of a set of mechanical transformation principles using machine springs and wheel axles. This crossbow bolt is very powerful, and it is stronger than the average small-caliber pistol bullet. This kind of equipment will only be deployed on some special forces who perform special tasks.       And this kind of repeater has the advantage that it can be made into various shapes according to needs. Such as boxes, backpacks, etc., can also be made into Hidden Arrows.       Leng Feng first planned to make the repeater, so he spent the morning in the house drawing the design. He designed two repeater crossbows, a special operations crossbow that he had used in his previous life, and a modified Hidden Arrow crossbow.       These two kinds of repeaters are one large and one small, and they have a variety of styles, and the most important thing is that they can also be fired in bursts. There is a crossbow clamp that can be loaded with eight bolts in advance, but in order to ensure power, the launcher must be manually pulled for each shot. Of course, it is also possible to create a double or triple shot, but in this way, the power will be reduced.       Overall, there are pros and cons to each. The special operations crossbow is a single shot, and since it is fired head-on, it does not pay attention to surprise, as long as the power is sufficient.       The Sleeve Arrow Crossbow is a hidden weapon, which is particular about surprise, and can be designed to be small and exquisite. Leng Feng changed the crossbow bolt to a flying needle, quenched with a rapid anesthetic, which can fire dozens of flying needles at the same time.       This kind of design is still thanks to those online novels in the previous life, among which there is a hidden weapon called the Rainstorm Pear Flower Needle, which makes people in the rivers and lakes smell and change. Although Leng Feng didn't know the design principle of the Rainstorm Pear Flower Needle, he could get inspiration from it and design the Sleeve Arrow Bird as a flying needle mass device.       And his Hidden Arrow Crossbow has an advantage over the Rainstorm Pear Flower Needle, the legendary Rainstorm Pear Flower Needle is disposable, but his Hidden Arrow Crossbow can be installed with three needle boxes. That is, in a short time, three launches are possible.       This change is actually not difficult, and the design principle of the Special Warfare Bow and Crossbow is similar, but there are some minor changes. Leng Feng had personally made special operations crossbows before, so even in this era, he was sure to make them.       After the afternoon, Leng Feng called Ah Hu over. At present, Ah Hu's family is working in the mulberry field of Leng Feng's family, and Ah Hu's work is really overkill. Leng Feng has to do things now, and he really can't do it without Ah Hu.       After all, in this day and age, due to the constraints of conditions, it takes a huge amount of time and energy to complete these by one person.       Ah Hu is not only born with divine powers, but also the personal disciple of the only blacksmith in Hongshan Villa, Old Man Ouyang. Old man Ouyang is a strange old man, like Leng Feng's family, he is not a native of Hongshanzhuang. When the rich man Leng was preparing to build this mansion in Hongshan Village, the old man Ouyang also came to Hongshan Villa with a set of iron-striking tools.       Old man Ouyang was a blacksmith, but unlike other blacksmiths, Old Man Ouyang only made one piece of iron a day, and no one was allowed to watch him make iron.       But although everyone is very strange, there is no opinion. After all, people in this era did not need many iron tools, and often a piece of iron could be used for a long time. Especially the tools created by the hands of Old Man Ouyang, each piece is durable.       There are many people's farm tools in Hongshan Villa, all of which were built by Old Man Ouyang when he came to the first year, and there is still no problem with using them.Another strange thing about Old Man Ouyang was that he never interacted with anyone in Hongshan Villa. Although his appearance is not vicious, it gives people a feeling that they are not approached. Especially those naughty children in Hongshan Villa, as soon as they saw this old man Ouyang, they would immediately run away in fright.       Even if it was Leng Dashao before, every time he passed by Old Man Ouyang's courtyard, he would bypass it far away. Even Leng Dashao, who has always been not afraid of heaven and earth, was inexplicably stunned by this old man.       However, Old Man Ouyang's attitude towards Ah Hu was completely different from that towards others, and when Ah Hu was eight years old, he recruited him into the blacksmith shop, saying that he wanted to pass on his skills to Ah Hu. Due to the large population of Ah Hu's family, he often eats the last meal without the next, and his father is naturally very happy that Old Man Ouyang can take Ah Hu as an apprentice and manage three meals a day.       In this way, Ah Hu followed Old Man Ouyang to fight iron for five years. Half a year ago, Old Man Ouyang left Hongshan Villa, and his yard was handed over to Ah Hu's care.       Leng Dashao also asked Ah Hu to take him to Old Man Ouyang's courtyard to visit, mainly because Leng Dashao was still quite curious about Old Man Ouyang, but after visiting that once, he was no longer interested. For this courtyard is filled with a mess of stones and all sorts of gray iron, except for a set of iron-striking tools.       Although Leng Dashao likes to collect strange things, he is not interested in these things.       But now Leng Feng knew that those things were extremely pure iron ore, and there were even a lot of other rare ores, and he didn't know where Old Man Ouyang collected them. Now Leng Feng is going to build a self-defense weapon, so these raw materials are equivalent to a sleepy person meeting a pillow for him.       Leng Feng didn't hide it from Ah Hu, and handed him the drawings he had designed. However, Leng Feng did not draw the overall picture, but a subdivision of each part. As long as these parts are available, the cold front can easily assemble them.       Although Ah Hu didn't go to school, he also knew a lot of words during the few years he followed Old Man Ouyang. He could understand this figure, but he was confused about some of the numbers and mechanical principles marked by Leng Feng.       This is a system of knowledge from another era, although it is not very profound, but some quantitative units and mechanical calculation methods are undoubtedly heavenly books for people of this era.       "Young Master Feng, if I'm not mistaken, this drawing of yours should be a kind of bow and crossbow. However, this kind of bow and crossbow is very strange, and the master also taught me how to make a crossbow, but I have never seen this style. ”
       Ah Hu looked at the drawings carefully, and said with a slight frown.       When Leng Feng heard this, he was slightly surprised in his heart, he really didn't expect Ah Hu to actually build a bow and crossbow. Judging from Leng Dashao's previous cognition, he just thought that Ah Hu could create some ordinary iron utensils, but he didn't expect that the eccentric old man Ouyang would know these skills.       "Ah Hu, what skills have you learned from Old Man Ouyang?" Leng Feng was really curious, not only him, but also Ah Hu and his own father didn't necessarily know how many skills Ah Hu had learned.       "It's nothing, it's just some iron-making skills. In addition to kitchen knives, sickles and axes, the master also taught me how to build various weapons, but the master also said that I am not good at acting, and I need to practice more. Ah Hu scratched his head embarrassedly and said.       Leng Feng was very happy when he heard Ah Hu say this, it seems that he really doesn't have the aura of the protagonist. With Ah Hu's help, it shouldn't be difficult to make these things.       "Can you build these parts on the picture?" Leng Feng asked.       "There should be no problem! But what do the numbers on these drawings mean? Ah Hu didn't ask much about why Leng Feng wanted to build these things, but became interested in the numbers on these drawings.Leng Feng smiled when he heard this, he understood that people in this era didn't understand this way of counting. So, Leng Feng talked to Ah Hu in detail again. What Leng Feng didn't expect was that Ah Hu looked very stout, but he knew nothing about these things.       It seems that Old Man Ouyang's vision is still good, and Ah Hu is indeed very talented in this regard.       "Did you invent this method of counting? It's so easy to use! ”
       After understanding the modern counting method, Ah Hu looked at Leng Feng again with a hint of admiration.       Although Leng Dashao was cunning before, he was not the one who did a lot of evil, and he only played tricks on those self-righteous guys. In today's words, the objects of Leng Dashao's tricks are the kind of people who love to load coins. For ordinary people or poor people, Leng Dashao will never take the initiative to provoke.       Even, there are rumors in Linjiang City that he once took beggars to visit the Qinglou in a group.       The Leng Rich Man and the Leng Li family may also be the reason why they will let it go when they see that Leng Feng's nature is not bad.       Ah Hu used to just think that Leng Da Shao was not bad to their family, and Leng Da Shao often gave him some delicious food, so Ah Hu still had a good feeling for Leng Feng.       In this era, most of the common people are very simple-minded, and they often distinguish between good and bad people, not by listening to the big truth, but by seeing who is good to them.       Especially this time, Leng Feng won the top spot, which made Ah Hu feel that Leng Feng was a character. When Leng Feng gave him the parts on the drawings before, Ah Hu's heart was already shocked, and now after listening to Leng Feng's introduction of this counting method, he felt that Young Master Feng had great talent.       "Sort of!"       Leng Feng said that there was no psychological burden, after all, he brought this counting method to this era. Just like the spread of Arabic numerals, although they were not created by the Arabs, they would not have been able to spread so quickly around the world without them.       "Can I use this method in the future?" Ah Hu asked.       "You can use whatever you want." Leng Feng said with a smile.       An hour later, Ah Hu had already figured everything out under Leng Feng's explanation. The two of them left the Leng family's mansion, Ah Hu opened Old Man Ouyang's blacksmith shop, and the two walked in.       Leng Dashao had been here before, but he wasn't interested in it at that time.       From the perspective of Leng Feng's modern people, the environment here is indeed not very good, just an ordinary rural yard. The fence is made of bamboo, and unlike normal people, this fence is tall and thick.       It seems that Old Man Ouyang has done a good job of protecting privacy, at least in the countryside at this time, few people will make the fence wall so strong.There were no flowers or anything like anything in the yard, and there was a well in the middle, and there was a pool made of stone troughs next to the well. There are some messy things scattered around the yard, and it looks very cluttered.       There are several piles of stones on the side of the courtyard wall, and the most is dark black iron ore, which is extremely pure, and a little refining is the best iron material. There were a few yellow and brown stones, and a few other colored stones, but Leng Feng couldn't recognize anything other than iron ore and the yellow copper ore.       After all, this is not his specialty, and if it is ready-made material, he can recognize it.       "These are the raw materials that my master used to experiment!" Ah Hu saw Leng Feng staring at those ores and explained.       Hearing Ah Hu say this, Leng Feng knew that this old man Ouyang was not just a blacksmith, if it was placed in modern times, it was a scientific research worker.       In this era, after thousands of years of development, most of the weapons and tools are mainly made of iron. As for alloys or rare metal materials, they are extremely rare and basically naturally occurre.       The legendary weapons are full of mystery, mainly because of the rarity of rare metal raw materials.       But here with Old Man Ouyang, Leng Feng saw that among these scraps underground, many of them were alloy products. Although these materials seem to be wasted, they can also prove that Old Man Ouyang has completely walked in the forefront of the times in the research of metal materials.       Although Leng Feng didn't know Old Man Ouyang, it could be seen from these discarded materials that Old Man Ouyang was definitely an expert in this area.       "The master said that these things are all waste products, and they are useless!" Seeing Leng Feng staring at the scrap metal again, Ah Hu immediately explained to him.       In fact, there is no need for him to say it, Leng Feng can also see it. These things do not have the value of reuse, that is, the level of science and technology in the previous life was so developed, and this disproportionate alloy does not have much recycling value.       "Is there any material that has been successfully studied?"       Leng Feng nodded and said that he understood, but what he wanted to know most was what materials Old Man Ouyang had researched. It's about his weapons manufacturing plan, and once the problem of raw materials is solved, then more advanced weapons can be made.       "Yes, but most of them were taken away by him, saying that he was going to exchange forging experience with someone." Ah Hu didn't hide Leng Feng either, and told Leng Feng the answer he wanted to hear the most.       "Okay, let's take a look!"       When Leng Feng heard Ah Hu say this, he suddenly became interested. Because from these discarded materials, he has seen several alloy materials, and even titanium alloy and tungsten steel alloy. These two alloys are of great use to him at the moment.       Ah Hu nodded, and took out the key to open the door to a stone room. This is the strongest house in Ouyang's blacksmith shop, which is used to store the finished tools and various materials.       The house is not big, only thirty or forty square meters, and dozens of farm tools and household utensils are placed in it, but these things are casually thrown in a corner. Some of them were covered with rust, and it seemed that Old Man Ouyang didn't pay much attention to these things.       On one side there was a stone slab, on which were placed rows of weapons, and at a glance there were dozens of them. All kinds of weapons are of different lengths, but Leng Feng glanced at them, and he was not interested, because these weapons seemed to be rough.There was also a stone platform on the other side, and the metal blocks placed on it attracted Leng Feng's attention. These metals come in a variety of shapes, ranging from round, square, and irregularly shaped. Most of them are long strips of square steel, and some copper blocks.       "These are the materials that the master has successfully refined!" Ah Hu saw that Leng Feng was interested in these materials, so he explained to Leng Feng.       Leng Feng picked up the two pieces of steel and struck each other a few times, and there was a crisp sound of fine iron.       "What level of iron is this!"       "This is not iron, it has exceeded the strength of 100 steels!"       "100 steel!"       Leng Feng was overjoyed when he heard this, if this kind of steel exceeded the strength of 100 steels, then it would save too much effort for him.       Leng Feng weighed the steel in his hand, although he was not an expert in metal materials, he also knew what it meant to be a hundred steels.       In this era, there was no technology for steel refining. The so-called 100 refining into steel refers to putting the iron in the charcoal fire to burn red, and after manual forging again and again, there is a saying that 100 is refined into steel. The principle is to use the method of artificial forging and quenching to clean up the useless impurities in the iron little by little. When the charcoal is calcined, the carbon content of the forged iron will also increase, so that a material similar to high-carbon steel is obtained.       This is how the high-carbon steel of this era was obtained, but compared with the high-carbon steel of the cold front's era, it is still unattainable in some properties.       However, this material is far superior to ordinary iron in terms of strength and toughness.       Due to productivity, steel forged in this way is very scarce, and in the army, only people who have reached the rank of general can be equipped with swords forged from this material.       If the two pieces of steel in his hands really surpassed the hundred steels, it means that Old Man Ouyang must have mastered the method of refining steel.       Leng Feng didn't see equipment similar to a steelmaking furnace here, and he didn't know how this old man Ouyang made this kind of steel. However, these steels are enough for him to use now, and when Old Man Ouyang comes back in the future, he must find out what is going on.       Because this is related to a series of plans in the future of Leng Feng, this kind of talent must be fooled into his own account.       When Leng Feng was in military school before, he also learned about the refining principles of some special materials. He knew the smelting methods of high-carbon steel and tungsten gold steel, but because there was no professional testing equipment in this era, he could not determine what level the two pieces of steel in his hands had reached.       However, this is difficult for him, and he can roughly judge the grade of this steel in a primitive and simple way. This primitive method relies on stretching and bending to test the properties of steel.       Putting down the two pieces of steel in his hand, Leng Feng saw two more titanium alloys and one tungsten steel alloy.       Roughly calculated, there are a total of seven pieces of steel here, each of which has a dozen catties. Five pieces of copper, each weighing more than ten catties. There are also two pieces of titanium alloy and one piece of tungsten steel alloy, each of which weighs more than ten catties.In fact, these metals are not much, close to two hundred catties. But for the current Leng Feng, the material problem of making his special repeater has been completely solved.       Anyway, now Old Man Ouyang is not here, Ah Hu listens to him again, and he can borrow these materials.       Yes, in Leng Feng's words, it is borrowed, but it is cut first and then played, and then the price will be calculated with him when Old Man Ouyang comes back. If Old Man Ouyang still had any opinions, there were many ways in his mind to exchange them with him. Presumably, with Old Man Ouyang's obsession with forging and smelting metal, Leng Feng's knowledge should be able to fool him.       And the use of these materials is also a good thing for Ah Hu. Because Ah Hu said that before Old Man Ouyang left, he specially confessed to Ah Hu, and these materials were left for him. However, Old Man Ouyang had a request, let Ah Hu use these materials to create a weapon, and this weapon was not only powerful, but also a category that was not found in this stone room.       Ordinary weapons are not difficult for Ah Hu, but if they follow Old Man Ouyang's requirements, they are not far from the divine weapons, and they are also divine weapons that have never appeared.       How does this make Ah Hu complete, although he is very talented in this area, but it is not easy to complete this task. But now with these drawings provided by Leng Feng, once the special operations crossbow is built, Ah Hu will be equivalent to completing the task.       As long as the task is completed, then the materials are used as a matter of course.       In fact, in Ah Hu's eyes, Old Man Ouyang was not as terrible as others in Hongshan Villa thought. Old man Ouyang is still good to him, but he doesn't usually like to talk much.       What's more, before Old Man Ouyang left, he had told Ah Hu that everything he left behind could be disposed of with him. If he doesn't come back, then everything here will be left to Ah Hu.       This is also the reason why Ah Hu told Leng Feng everything here, if Old Man Ouyang was still here, he would not dare to bring Leng Feng to the stone room. This place is very important to Old Man Ouyang, even Ah Hu has not had many opportunities to enter this stone room.       So, before it got dark, the cold front finally completed the physical testing of several materials.       The steel is fully compliant with the properties of high-carbon steel, as are the properties of copper and two other alloys.       In the next two days, Leng Feng and Ah Hu went headlong into Old Man Ouyang's blacksmith shop, and no one knew what they were messing with. But the cold people played a role, and no one paid attention to what they were doing.       Until the third day, Leng Feng looked at the two objects with a metallic sheen placed in front of him, and a satisfied smile appeared on his face. These two objects, one large and one small, were crossbows made according to his designs.       Ah Hu was also full of excitement, he didn't have a complete concept of this thing before, but these parts forged by his hands, under Leng Feng's operation, magically composed these two things.       They had also tested it just now, and that large special repeater could shoot an arrow through a finger-thick wooden plank from a distance of 100 paces. And the speed is so fast that it is difficult for the naked eye to catch the trajectory of the crossbow arrows.       The heavy city guarding crossbows of this era also have this power, and even more so than this. However, the heavy city defense crossbow is too cumbersome, and it takes several soldiers to operate one of these city defense crossbows at the same time. However, Leng Feng's special repeater can be operated by one person, as long as you pull the handlebar with the strength of an ordinary person, you can complete a charge.The barrel can be filled with eight bolts at a time, and for each shot, a small piece of shrapnel inside can be used to bounce the next bolt into the launch slot. With such a design, it is possible to complete eight rapid-fire shots in a very short time.       Leng Feng has created a total of ten such arrow boxes, as long as they are not facing a large number of war scenes, they are completely sufficient. These bolts can also be recycled, just refill them in the rack.       The tip of this crossbow is made of tungsten steel, and it is fired in a rotation, which not only has a low sound, but also has an extremely strong armor-piercing ability. With the armor defense of this era, it is simply unstoppable.       Of course, the main target of the cold front is not the armored soldiers, but the response to possible assassins. This kind of person is a master of martial arts, and if the number of ordinary bows and arrows is small, the threat to these people is limited.       But with the special crossbow arrows in hand, Leng Feng believed that even if he encountered someone who was more powerful than the killer in the flower boat last time, he would be able to shoot him with one arrow.       The special crossbow is designed to be foldable in a form that is only the size of an A4 sheet of paper, and it is also very square to carry around.       The volume of the Hidden Arrow is even smaller, only the size of an adult's palm, and it is semi-arc in shape and can be buckled on the small arm. Since most people in this era wore long robes, it was impossible to see that such a big killing weapon was hidden.       Sleeve arrows are also made of tungsten steel, each arrow is only slightly larger than a toothpick, and can also penetrate a wooden plank within ten meters. Twenty-four can be launched at a time, that is, no matter how high the kung fu is, as long as it is a sneak attack at close range, there is absolutely no possibility of escape.       I believe that as long as this kind of secret weapon appears on the rivers and lakes, it will definitely be a terrifying existence.       However, there is also a disadvantage of the Hidden Arrow, that is, it can only fire one round, and the pre-loaded crossbow bolts must be reloaded after firing. Although there are also arrow magazines, they are manually operated, and each arrow case can only be reloaded once.       Leng Feng also took this shortcoming into account and made changes to the launch device, changing the firing method of the Hidden Arrow to one to three launches.       There are a total of 24 small emitting holes, which can be fired all at once, or eight or sixteen at a time.       In this way, it is possible to operate selectively depending on the situation to be dealt with.       In addition to two crossbow arrows, a dagger was made of titanium alloy by the way. This dagger may be the first titanium alloy dagger born in this era, although the strength is not as strong as the dagger made of special metals in the previous life, but its sharpness and strength have far surpassed the steel dagger of this era.       And this dagger is of extraordinary significance to Leng Feng. This is a nostalgia for his previous life, because this dagger is modeled after his favorite Bayi-style saber in his previous life.       In his previous life, Leng Feng was extremely familiar with the performance of this saber, and the original Bayi-style saber was specially configured on the Bayi-style rifle, and it could also be disassembled and used as a dagger. Its combat ability is very perverted, even more ferocious than the famous five-six-style three-edged military thorn.Since it does not need to be mounted on a gun, Leng Feng also made some changes to the style of the Bayi saber, especially the design of the handle to be suitable for holding only in the hand.       The main shape remains unchanged, retaining the two-sided shape, with a total of four blood grooves. Once the target is stabbed, it is basically difficult to treat, because this shape can maximize the expansion of the target wound, and it is difficult to suture with the medical level of this era.       Weighing this familiar feeling in his hand, Leng Feng's breathing couldn't help but become short.       If you talk about power, this titanium dagger is really not as good as those two repeaters. But this is different from Leng Feng's emotional experience, holding the Bayi-style saber in his hand, which made him experience the feeling of enthusiasm as a special soldier again.       "Whew!"       Leng Feng exhaled a long breath of turbidity, calmed his mood, and put these things away.       "Ah Hu! Don't tell anyone about this just yet! Leng Feng said solemnly.       Although he knows that Ah Hu's mouth is very strict, but this is related to his life, and he still expects to be able to overthrow a group of people! Therefore, Leng Feng had to take it seriously.       "Young Master Feng, don't worry, I won't say it to anyone. But if the master comes back, what should I do with him? ”
       Although Ah Hu didn't understand why Leng Feng designed these things, and he didn't know what Leng Feng wanted to do when he created these things, he was a real person, and since he promised Leng Feng, he would strictly keep it a secret. However, with these special materials, once Old Man Ouyang came back, he didn't know what to say.       "You can tell him how this dagger was made, and as for these two things, I'll tell him later!" Leng Feng said.       "That's good!" Ah Hu nodded and said.       It's not that Ah Hu doesn't respect Old Man Ouyang, but he thinks that this thing was designed by Leng Feng, and he promised Leng Feng not to tell anyone, of course, this person also includes Old Man Ouyang.       "You take these things and look at them, and study them when you have nothing to do to see if you can build them."       Leng Feng handed Ah Hu another drawing, on which more than a dozen styles of parts were drawn. This is also because Leng Feng saw that Ah Hu's forging level was really good these days, so he drew some parts of the revolver and Mauser pistol, and wanted Ah Hu to try forging it.       "What is this?"       After Ah Hu took the drawing, he couldn't understand what was drawn on it at all. The repeater blueprints that Leng Feng showed him before, he could roughly see what those things were for. But now the parts on this drawing look strangely shaped, and they have little to do with each other.       "This is another weapon, even more powerful than these two!" Leng Feng pointed at the repeater and said.       "It's more powerful than this repeater!" Ah Hu looked at the parts on the drawing in disbelief and said.       To be honest, he really couldn't see it. By completing the forging of those two repeaters with Leng Feng before, he also roughly figured out the principle.But these parts, he only saw the strangeness, but he didn't see what the strength was.       "Hehe, you'll know when you make them!" Leng Feng said with a smile.       Of course, he knew that Ah Hu couldn't understand it, because this kind of hot weapon was simply incomprehensible to people whose thinking was still stuck on cold weapons.       And he doesn't plan to explain it to Ah Hu in such detail now, as long as Ah Hu can build these key parts, and when he returns from Jiankang Mansion, he can build the shell, and then assemble the two pistols he wants.       "I'm going to Jiankang Mansion in the next two days, and I'll take you to do big things with me when I come back!" Leng Feng patted Ah Hu's shoulder and said.       At this moment, Leng Feng's body exuded a powerful aura, and he was confident that he would stir up a storm in this era and establish his own strength.       After these few days of cultivation, his martial arts have improved rapidly. The Innate Divine Skill and the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demon Forging Divine Skills have all been successfully introduced, and their own strength has doubled compared to when the flower boat fell into the water. If he encounters that killer again, he is sure to kill him in a head-to-head battle.       Coupled with the fact that he and Ah Hu have successfully built weapons, he has the confidence to face several people who are stronger than him.       At this time, Leng Feng felt a sense of security in his heart. Although it has been less than ten days since he crossed into this world, the previous Leng Dashao has undergone a radical change.       However, because Leng Feng was well hidden, and because he had been staying with Ah Hu in Old Man Ouyang's blacksmith shop for the past few days.       Those scholars in Linjiang City invited Leng Feng several times to no avail, and no one invited him anymore. Moreover, the matter of falling into the water on the flower boat has spread in Linjiang City before, and many people think that Leng Feng is afraid.       Now the news that Leng Feng won the top spot in the selection test has slowly cooled down. Although there are still many people who are impressed with Leng Dashao, people's inherent concepts have the upper hand again, and some people still think that Leng Feng is shit luck this time, or that there is something inside that they don't know.       Leng Feng didn't know that there was already a rumor circulating in Linjiang City that was unfavorable to him. There has even been news that Leng Feng's article on the selection test has a lot of moisture, and I don't know where Leng Dashao copied it from. And the song that Leng Feng made on the flower boat at the beginning of the Spring River Flower Moon Night, I don't know why, it didn't spread.       In short, although Leng Dashao won the top spot in the selection test, due to Leng Feng's deliberately low-key, not many people are paying attention to him.       However, in the past few days, other scholars in Linjiang City have been very lively, and Liang Dong has attracted a large number of people to promote him during this period.       Regarding the reaction of those scholars in Linjiang City, Leng Feng didn't take it to heart. Even if he wants to develop his power, those people are not the ones he wants to woo. In the troubled times that will be faced next, the truly useless ones are scholars.       Of course, the most important thing is that he feels that the character of these scholars is not good, and such people just want to follow him, and he is not at ease.       Leng Feng has already put the weapons and equipment that he has built in the past few days, and there are special operations crossbows in one skin bag, as well as ten arrow magazines. The left and right arms were already fitted with Hidden Arrows, and due to the small size of the Hidden Arrows, he placed them in his belt.       With everything ready, Leng Feng went to Jiankang Mansion.       It's still the old carriage, with Leng Feng and Fluttershy sitting on top of it, and Chai Bo driving the carriage in front. Under the gaze of the women of the Leng family, the three of them slowly left Hongshanzhuang with the carriage.In everyone's cognition, Leng Dashao is the first time to go far away. But there was no trace of nervousness on his face, and of course there was no excitement, he seemed very calm.       Fluttershy's girl, on the other hand, is nervous and excited. For her, going to Jiankang Mansion was a long trip, and it was the first time she had traveled far since she was so old.       Although Linjiang City is a few days away from Jiankang Mansion, the traffic situation in this era is really worrying. It's fine if it's all sunny, but if it's raining, you won't be able to walk.       Chai Bo is an experienced traveler, and he is very familiar with the journey from Linjiang to Jiankang Mansion. Ideally, it would take about five or six days, and if the weather is bad, the time will be extended.       In this era, it is not only a matter of difficulty in traveling, but also in some remote places.       Fortunately, there are many official roads along the way from Linjiang City to Jiankang Mansion, and the security situation is not so worrying. This is also the reason why Leng Li was relieved to let Chai Bo take Leng Feng to Jiankang Mansion, not temporarily, but after careful consideration.       Leng Feng looked at the little girl's little face that was slightly ruddy because of nervousness and excitement, and he couldn't help laughing.       "Young master, do I have ash on my face?" Fluttershy sees Leng Feng smiling at her face, thinking her face is stained with dust, and subconsciously wipes it with her hand.       "Haha!" Seeing Fluttershy's slightly silly appearance, Leng Feng couldn't help but laugh again.       "Others laugh at me for being crazy, I laugh at others and can't see through it!"       At this time, Leng Feng suddenly thought of the poem written by Tang Bohu, a talented man in his previous life, and he couldn't help but recite it out loud.       The flowers and willows are green everywhere along the way, and the natural environment of this era is very well preserved, but due to the hardships of the people's lives, few people go to spring to enjoy the scenery. There are pedestrians along the way, but most of them are walking with their heads bored.       Such a scenery seems to people who are poorly clothed and hungry, and it is a barrenness. And for those who have solved the problem of food and clothing, it is a pleasing scenery. The environment is the same environment, but it looks different to different people.       Leng Feng belongs to the latter, although most of their family's property has been seized by the two uncles, but for him, he has never been troubled by food and clothing.       Hearing that Leng Feng suddenly came out of nowhere, Fluttershy and Chai Bo both felt that the young master's body seemed to exude a special aura at this time, and people couldn't help but feel like a mountain looking up.       In fact, this is not a deliberate show, but Leng Feng's true feelings. After all, this situation is very much in line with his state of mind, and when he went to Jiankang Mansion, he decided not to be so low-key. Originally, Leng Dashao was looked down upon, if he didn't show something, how could he achieve his goal!       "Good, good poetry!"       At this moment, there was a sound of admiration from the side of the carriage. Leng Feng lifted the curtain of the carriage and turned his head to look, and found that four people were sitting on the ground under a big tree on the side of the road.       "It's not easy next week, I don't know what this brother is called?" Seeing Leng Feng look over, one of the men dressed as scholars clenched his fists and said.       The previous voice of admiration was also what he said. This person was dressed in a green robe, although he was dressed as a scholar, but he didn't look like a scholar, and his body was filled with a heroic and extraordinary momentum."Brother Tai has won the award, and he is under the cold front!"       At this time, Chai Bo had already stopped the carriage, and Leng Feng jumped out of the carriage and said. He could see that this scholar was very unusual, far from being comparable to Liang Dong's pretentious guy.       Zhou Buyi saw that Leng Feng was calm, and he also felt that Leng Feng was not simple with a personable appearance, so he hurriedly invited him: "The so-called meeting is fate, why don't you come over and have a drink with us?" ”
       Zhou Buyi is not an ordinary scholar, he is bold by nature and likes to make friends. Of course, the friends he makes must also be eye-catching.       I heard Leng Feng's sentence that others laughed at me for being too crazy, and I laughed that others couldn't see through it, so Zhou Buyi felt that it was extraordinary to be able to say this kind of poem. Now seeing that Leng Feng is a little boy, his demeanor is far from being comparable to that of ordinary young people, which makes Zhou Buyi feel like a friend.       "Okay, that's it!" Leng Feng did not twist, and happily accepted the invitation to join the ranks of Zhou Buyi's four.       Leng Feng's eyes were very vicious, and he could tell that these four people were all masters, and their kung fu was far superior to that of the assassin he had encountered on the flower boat before.       Although Leng Feng was wary of the two uncles who would send someone to assassinate him along the way, he would never suspect that Zhou Buyi and the four of them would not be suspicious. Because if these four people want to be against him, even if he uses all his strength, he can't resist it.       Although Leng Feng couldn't see that this was a person's specific strength, he trusted his instincts.       The other three were also dressed in scribe's robes, and they looked equally imposing. The so-called things gather by like, people by groups, everyone is a bold person, Leng Feng quickly won their recognition.       The four of them had been drinking and resting under the tree, and there were several wine jars on top of a rock, but there were no snacks. There is only a large bag of peanuts, and it seems that there is an allusion to the fact that two taels of peanuts can drink a jar of wine, which has existed since ancient times.       Although Leng Feng didn't have alcohol in the car, he brought a lot of food.       Since it was less than half a day away from Linjiang City, the food in the car was still very rich. Leng Feng brought a roast chicken, a saltwater goose and a few braised pig's trotters, and everyone talked about eating and drinking.       Leng Feng also knew that Zhou Buyi and the four of them came from the north, in addition to Zhou Buyi, the other three were named Wang Bulun, Huang Buyi, and Li Bufan. These four people are brothers in the same sect, as for which force they belong to, the other party didn't say Leng Feng or ask.       However, judging from the names of these four people, what they said should be true. It's nondescript, it's not easy to be extraordinary, it seems that the level of their master's name is really not very good.       Because the routes of Leng Feng and Zhou Buyi are different, one is to the south and the other is to the north, after they are full of wine and food, the two sides will separate.       However, this encounter with Leng Feng was not without gain, first of all, he knew the current situation in the north. The war in the north is coming to an end, the Jin people have been defeated by the Mongolians, and the imperial court established by the Jin people has been occupied by the Mongolians.       And that's not the main thing, the Mongolia are said to have begun to prepare to divide their forces south. With the fighting power of the Mongolia iron cavalry, there is currently no army in the Southern Song Dynasty that can compete with it.       However, the Southern Song court, which was in a corner of peace, was still intoxicated by singing and dancing, and even fantasized about the two tigers of the Jin and the Mongolian fighting each other, so as to benefit from the fishermen.It seems that the four of Zhou Buyi are not simple, and they even know the news that the Mongolia army is going south.       At the same time, Leng Feng also knew about the existence of the four of Zhou Buyi, and there were many more in the north. Although the north is occupied by foreign races, due to the vast land in the north, whether it is the Liao people or the Jin people at the beginning, including the current Mongolia, although they can fight well, but due to population reasons, most of the places can only be occupied and cannot be governed.       This has also led to the fact that there are many powerful forces in the north, and large and small forces are distributed there. And the four of Zhou Buyi are also from one of the forces.       Although Leng Feng has not yet seen the ability of Zhou Buyi and the others, it can be seen from their conversation that the ability of these four people is very strong. In particular, Zhou Buyi is a talented person who is both civil and military, and he also has a thorough view of the current situation in the world.       If you want to develop your own power, Zhou Buyi and the four are good candidates. However, Leng Feng does not have the strength to recruit Zhou Buyi and others, but fortunately, a good relationship has been established between the two of them now, which has laid a good foundation for further development in the future.       "Brother Leng will leave here, and when our brother's affairs are completed, he will definitely go to your mansion to disturb him when he comes back and passes through Linjiang City!"       "Brother Zhou, Brother Huang, Brother Li, Brother Wang! The little brother must sweep the couch to greet him, and then we will be drunk and rest! ”
       "Okay, farewell!"       "Farewell!"       The two sides hugged each other and separated, what Leng Feng didn't know was that it was this encounter that Zhou Buyi and the four of them helped the freshman in the capital
       A big favor.       The reason why Zhou Buyi and the four of them value Leng Feng is not just the poem that others laugh at me for being too crazy, and I laugh at others for not being able to see through it. The function of this poem is only to serve as a stepping stone for the two sides to meet.       The most important thing is that Zhou Buyi and the four of them have seen Leng Feng's temperament, which makes them feel that Leng Feng is a person who can be befriended. Moreover, after Leng Feng went through the cultivation of the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Body Divine Skill, his body and temperament changed, and he looked more mature than his actual age.       This made Zhou Buyi and the four of them have an illusion, thinking that Leng Feng was someone of the same age as them.       The encounter with Zhou Buyi and the four of them on the road was just a small episode, which did not affect Leng Feng's hurry, and he finally came to a small town before dark.       This is the case in this era, and under normal circumstances, you don't rush at night. Especially for people like Leng Feng who are away from home, as long as they come across a place to rest before dark, they will wait until dawn the next day to leave.       Not to mention that it is difficult to walk at night, but more importantly, safety is not guaranteed.       Leng Feng naturally understood this, so after entering this town, he asked Chai Bo to find an inn to prepare for accommodation. In fact, all this is within Chai Bo's plan, for Chai Bo, he has walked this road many times, and he is familiar with everything on the road.This place is called Lotus Town, although it is called Town, but it is not much bigger than Hongshan Villa. The environment here is very poor at first glance, and the whole town has only one street less than 100 meters, and you can see the head at a glance.       However, although the town is small, there are hotel tea shops. Chai Bo stopped the carriage, and the three of them drank a pot of tea on the street. What Leng Feng didn't expect was that Chai Bo actually knew the old man who sold tea, and he seemed to be very familiar.       It turned out that in the early years, Chai Bo often traveled with Leng Dashao's father, Leng Wuya. He was familiar with many stops along the way, that is, when he got older, he didn't go out again.       "Lao Chai, why haven't I seen your owner pass by here all these years?" The old man who sold tea said.       "Our owner had an accident, and business has not been good in recent years, so there are no foreign travelers!" Chai Bo and the old man who sold tea chatted with each other.       Lotus Town was also familiar to Chai Bo, and he knew that there was only one inn here, but he hadn't passed through it in years. Chai Bo is a person with a lot of experience in going out, he knows that the world is not peaceful now, and he must be cautious when he goes to a strange place.       seems to be casually chatting with the old man who sells tea, but in fact, he has already inquired about the situation here. Two years ago, there was a bandit plague here, and several local government officials were killed by the bandits, and the case has not been solved until now.       This is also the reason why Lotus Town seems to be depressed, you must know that although it was only a small town before, it is still very prosperous.       At the same time, I also knew that there were three guests living in the inn today, and two of them were past merchants, and the old man who sold tea also knew him. The other one was a team of dart masters, four in all, and it seemed that the escort was not of much value.       Sure enough, there is an old man in the family, if there is a treasure, this is a good saying. Chai inadvertently inquires about the situation, and then walks to the inn with Leng Feng and Fluttershy.       There is also a reason why Chai Bozhi is so careful, he is an old man of the Leng family, so he naturally understands Leng Feng's current situation. He even knew the thoughts of the second and third uncles of the Leng family better than Leng Li, and knew that Leng Feng's journey to Jiankang Mansion would definitely not be peaceful.       Because they left suddenly, the second and third uncles of the Leng family didn't know what they were going to do. But now that a day has come down, presumably the second and third uncles of the Leng family have figured out their walking routes, and they may encounter trouble from now on, and even trouble is already on the way.       Now away from Linjiang City, if those two people think of being unfavorable to Leng Feng, it is the best opportunity to make a move.       Knowing the situation here in advance is also to prevent it from happening.       For what Chai Bo was worried about, Leng Feng also knew it in his heart. When they left Hongshanzhuang, they may have attracted the attention of the second and third uncles. It's just that they didn't know where Leng Feng was going to go at that time, and even now they may not know what Leng Feng and the three of them want to do.       However, Leng Feng will not report that he is lucky, he is completely sure that the itinerary of the three of them has been mastered by the second and third uncles.       If the second and third uncles want to be unfavorable to Leng Feng, the next step is the best opportunity to make a move. After all, Leng Feng had already left Linjiang City at this time, and if something happened outside, it was difficult for others to associate with them.       And at this time, although Leng Feng won the top spot in the selection test, this top spot was only from Linjiang City, even if Leng Feng encountered an accident, it was not greatly affected. Once Leng Feng faces the saint, if he is allowed to get the attention of the saint again, if Leng Feng has any accidents at that time, the impact will not be something that the two uncles can afford.It was precisely with this in mind that Leng Feng created some self-defense weapons before going out.       But with his understanding of the world, he is still not as good as a person like Chai Bo who used to do business all over the world. For example, when he stayed in Lotus Town at this time, he was not as cautious and meticulous as Chai Bo.       After the bandit plague two years ago, Lotus Town has not yet recovered, and there are more than a dozen beggars on the street in a short time. When Leng Feng and the others walked into the only restaurant in Lotus Town, they found a little beggar leaning on the threshold of the restaurant.       The little beggar was thin and dirty, and his face was covered with dirt, and he couldn't see his face clearly. It looked like a wooden stake, and only a pair of dark eyes were grunting, indicating that this was still a living person.       This little beggar was different from the beggars Leng Feng saw on the street, he didn't ask anyone for food, he just leaned on the threshold silently, blinked a pair of eyes, and looked inside pitifully.       There are three tables of guests in the inn, and these three tables of guests are the three groups of people that Chai Bo inquired about when he was drinking tea before. Two tables are past merchants, one table is the four dart masters, and other individual customers are not. In this era, the first floor of the inn was basically a place to eat and drink, the second floor was a place for people to stay, and the backyard was used to place the guests' horses and other livestock.       With the current environment of Lotus Town, the locals rarely go to the restaurant, and the business done by this inn is basically pedestrians and merchants.       The environment is not very good, but it is spacious enough and relatively tidy, but the price of meals and accommodation is not cheap.       Leng Feng and the three asked for a table and ordered a few side dishes, but they didn't dare to eat and drink.       It's not just about money, it's important to be safe when you go out this year, and you have to keep in mind the truth that money is not exposed. Just like Leng Feng's group, young and old, it is very dangerous to be targeted by bad actors.       The shopkeeper and the guys of the inn have changed a group of people, and they are no longer the shops that Chai Bo knew before. It is said that the owner and his companions of this inn were killed in the bandits two years ago, and when encountering these unknown people, Chai Bo naturally seemed to be more cautious.       The three tables of guests in the inn all looked at them after they saw Leng Feng and the three of them come in. However, after seeing Leng Feng and his party, old and young, who seemed to be no threat, he ignored them.       Leng Feng also looked at them, and these three groups of people didn't look abnormal. Even those four dart masters also seem to be well-behaved.       After all, the people who can go out in this era are either ordinary people, or they are forced to go out to find a livelihood. You don't know what kind of people you can't afford to provoke, and everyone is wary of each other, except for Zhou Buyi, who likes to take the initiative to make friends, most of them have an attitude of not caring about themselves.       This is a bit unaccustomed to Leng Feng from another world, after all, the world he lives in is about relying on his parents at home and his friends when he goes out.       So when he saw the little beggar at the door, blinking a pair of pitiful eyes, Leng Feng felt that he couldn't turn a blind eye. You must know that when Leng Feng was in elementary school, he was a five-good young pioneer who helped his grandmother cross the road and took the initiative to give up his seat to the elderly on the bus.       Of course, he would not invite the beggars to go to the Qinglou in a group like Leng Dashao before, and he would not have the sympathy to let the beggars sit at the same table with them to eat.       Leng Feng beckoned the shopkeeper to stir-fry a plate of side dishes, plus four large steamed buns and put them on a table near the door, so that the beggar could eat two bites of hot rice.At first, the shopkeeper didn't agree, and even persuaded Leng Feng that it was very dangerous to do this, these beggars are not good at stubble, once they know that he is a kind person, they will pester you.       As for these beggars, there is no need to worry that they will starve to death. When the inn closes, some leftovers will be left outside the door, and those beggars who want to eat will come and pick them up. It's an unwritten rule in Lotus Town, where some people leave uneaten meals at the door.       This is also the reason why there are more than a dozen beggars in a small lotus town.       However, Leng Feng said not to worry, he just passed by here by chance, and he will leave tomorrow, so there will be no trouble. The shopkeeper saw that he had already reminded him, so he didn't listen to the advice.       When the beggar saw Leng Feng inviting him to dinner, he immediately came to life, ran to the table like a gust of wind, grabbed a steamed bun and devoured it. After eating a steamed bun in a few bites, it seems that he is indeed hungry.       After eating a steamed bun, the beggar grabbed the remaining three steamed buns, picked up the dish on the table and walked to the table of Leng Feng and the three of them, put the things on the table and sat down.       "Thank you for this son, you are such a good man! I've been standing here for three days, and you're the first to invite me to dinner. Childe, you are a good person with good rewards, can you invite me to eat a roast chicken? It's been a long time since I've had a meat! ”
       The little beggar's voice was hoarse, but the words he said made Leng Feng feel funny. This guy really has to make inches, and he kindly asked him to fill his stomach, and he even wants to eat chicken.       "Go, go, don't get an inch! My young master kindly invited you to dinner, but you still want to eat chicken, don't you see that even we don't have chicken to eat! Chai Bo waved his hand to drive away the little beggar and said.       The little beggar seemed to be frightened by Chai Bo, his neck shrunk, and he looked pitiful without saying a word.       "You want to eat roast chicken! Okay, then I'll treat you to roast chicken! ”
       Leng Feng thought this little beggar was interesting, although he looked pitiful, but this little beggar didn't seem to be afraid of people.       Leng Feng asked for another roast chicken and fulfilled the little beggar's wish. As soon as this guy saw the roast chicken being served, he immediately held it with both hands and bit it down the chicken leg.       "Delicious! Delicious! The little beggar munched on the chicken in his mouth, muttering indistinctly, the corners of his mouth shining with oil.       Leng Feng watched the little beggar eat chicken, and subconsciously twitched the corner of his mouth. Fluttershy laughs when she sees the little beggar, while Chai Bo shakes his head helplessly.       As for the other three tables of guests in the inn, they didn't seem to care about Leng Feng's movements.       These people are all veterans who have been wandering around all year round, and naturally understand the truth that curiosity kills cats. No matter what kind of thing it is, as long as it has nothing to do with them, it will not be easy to interfere. Young people like Leng Feng, in their opinion, are the beating of the lack of society.At this time, in the hearts of these people, Leng Feng has been planned as a rookie without any experience.       "You're such a good person, I've grown so big, and you're the first person to invite me to chicken!" The little beggar ate with a mouth full of oil, and at the same time did not forget to take the time to send Leng Feng a good guy card again.       Leng Feng smiled, ignored him, and took a sip of gruel. The little beggar shook his head and gnawed on the roast chicken in his hand, and after a while, only a pile of bones was left in a chicken gnaw.       "I'm full!" The little beggar wiped the shiny corner with his dirty hand and said.       Leng Feng saw the pile of chicken bones in front of him, as well as the vegetables that had already been eaten and there was not even soup left, plus four big steamed buns, and he didn't know how his small body could hold so many things.       "Just eat your fill!"       Leng Feng smiled, but he finally realized why Leng Dashao liked to spend money everywhere before, and this feeling was really a bit cool.       The little beggar said two more words of thanks, but he didn't pester Leng Feng, and then ran out.       "Young Master, you shouldn't have invited him to dinner, if he tells him about it, it will be a big trouble for us. This group of beggars has an extraordinary ability to entangle people, once they think that you are wronged, then it will be difficult to get out tomorrow! Chai Bo looked at the back of the little beggar running out, and said with a frown.       "It's okay, isn't it just a meal!" Leng Feng waved his hand indifferently and said.       Leng Feng really didn't take this matter to heart, after all, in the era he lived in, it was rare to see such a pure beggar. Inviting the little beggar to eat is partly out of interest.       Chai Bo also knew what kind of character Leng Dashao was, he just reminded him, and he didn't expect to be able to stop Leng Feng. And he is also confident that with him by Leng Feng's side, even if these beggars want to entangle, there is a way to solve it, so he did not stop Leng Feng's behavior before.       After eating, Chai opens three rooms, with Cold Front in the middle, and he and Fluttershy on the left and right. The luggage on the carriage was also carried by him to the room, so that even if something happened, they would take care of each other.       Leng Feng went to Jiankang Mansion this time, and he also brought a lot of things, all of which were packed in a large wooden box. There is a large wooden box to cover it, so that others do not know what is in the wooden box.       They didn't bring much gold and silver this time, most of them were calligraphy and painting antiques, and the weight was not heavy. Even experienced bandits and bandits thought that there was little oil and water in this dilapidated carriage. After all, most of the bandits and bandits in this era determined their targets according to the depth of the traces that the carriage should leave behind.       The gold and silver of this era are too bulky, and anyone with experience can tell whether you are a fat sheep or not by the traces of ruts.       This time they went to Jiankang Mansion and they only brought some coils, not much gold and silver. The gifts to meet Huang Mingli are all antiques, calligraphy and paintings, so as to avoid the targeting of bad people. This is also Chai Bo's decades of business experience, which allows them to reduce a lot of trouble along the way.Before going to bed, Leng Feng couldn't forget to cultivate the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Body Skill and Innate Divine Skill, and the reason why he wanted to open three rooms was also Leng Feng's request, because it was convenient for him to practice.       When cultivating the Innate Divine Skill, Leng Feng took out the special repeater in the leather bag and put it where he could reach it. And the folded repeater is opened, and the crossbow arrow is pushed into the launch slot, and if there is an accident, it can be fired as soon as possible.       Cultivating innate divine skills does not require sleep, and the sleeve arrow on the wrist has not been removed. The dagger transformed from the Bayi-style saber was hung by Leng Feng on his waist.       If something happens, he can ensure that his combat power is in the best condition. When cultivating innate divine skills, his five senses will be more sensitive, and as long as there is danger, he can sense it as soon as possible.       Leng Feng knew that from tonight onwards, he could encounter danger at any time. These dangers are not only from the two uncles, but also from the unexpected situations that may arise at any time in this troubled world.       As it turned out, Leng Feng's caution was not wrong, and he encountered two waves of attacks this night.       Not long after Leng Feng's carriage left Linjiang City, his two uncles got the news. The reason why Leng Feng's second and third uncles did not move in the past two days was because they were thinking about the trouble of Shuidong borrowing a knife to kill people.       Ever since he met Leng Feng's second and third uncles that day, Hall Master Huang had been tracking down the whereabouts of the killer on the flower boat. But after a few days, there was no progress. This was mainly due to the fact that his investigation was going in the wrong direction, and he did not know that the killer had died at the bottom of the river. If he had been able to dive to the bottom of the river to search, he might have found the body that had been soaked and deformed by the river.       In the eyes of Hall Master Huang, his brother's disappearance definitely had something to do with Leng Feng, and he had already sent someone into Hongshan Villa to investigate. However, according to their investigation, they still did not point the suspected target at the cold front, but only looked for suspicious targets around the cold front.       There have been no strangers in Hongshanzhuang recently, and the only person who aroused their suspicion was Old Man Ouyang. But Old Man Ouyang had been away from Hongshan Villa for a few months, and they had even sneaked into Old Man Ouyang's blacksmith shop to search, but they didn't find anything suspicious.       After all, those people under the Yellow Hall Master were all killers, and they didn't know what was special about these materials at all. In their eyes, it was normal for the blacksmith to have these things.       It's not that they haven't thought about taking direct action against Leng Feng to see if they can lure out the people behind Leng Feng. The reason why they haven't started is because they can't tell if the person behind Leng Feng is an existence they can afford, so they don't dare to act rashly.       And Leng Feng's second and third uncles also deliberately guided the suspicion of the Huang Hall Master in this direction.       At the same time, they also made two plans, and they have been arranging for people to monitor Leng Feng's movements. However, because Leng Feng stayed in Hongshanzhuang during this period and did not go out, these people did not dare to enter Hongshanzhuang blatantly.       After all, Hongshanzhuang is different from other villages, and most of the fertile land here belongs to Leng Feng's family. Due to the original decision of the rich man Leng and the land rent policy implemented after the Leng Li family led the whole family here, it has won the hearts of the people here.       It can be said that no one in Hongshanzhuang can be unfavorable to Leng Feng's family.       The manpower sent out by Second Uncle Leng Feng was not as good as those killers under the Huang Tang Master, after all, they could not sneak into Hongshan Villa quietly, and could only guard outside Zhuangzi.This day really made them discover the anomaly, at first when Leng Feng went out in a carriage, they thought that Leng Feng was going to enter the city. But unexpectedly, Leng Feng's carriage did not stop after entering Linjiang City, but went out directly from the other end of the city gate.       This situation was immediately reported to Leng Feng's second and third uncles, and at the same time, it was also notified to the Huang Hall Master, and the two groups of people immediately took action.       At first, they weren't sure what Leng Feng was trying to do, but after following for a long time, they found that Leng Feng's carriage had been heading north without any signs of turning around.       "Second brother, what do you say Leng Feng wants to do when this kid Leng Feng goes north?"       "You ask me, who do I ask?"       Although the second and third uncles discovered Leng Feng's whereabouts, they didn't know Leng Feng's destination, nor did they know what Leng Feng was going to do to the north.       "That's not the point! What the cold front is going to do is not something we should think about, but it is a great opportunity for us. Second Master Leng said with a frown.       "Second brother, what do you think we should do?"       Compared with Second Master Leng , Third Master Leng doesn't have so many fancy intestines, and he will do whatever Second Master Leng says, which is why the two of them can wear a pair of pants.       "We can't put all our hopes on the side of the Yellow Hall Master, he can solve Leng Feng best. To be on the safe side, it's time to use the back hand we prepared earlier! Second Master Leng pondered for a while and then spoke.       "Okay, I'll arrange it!"       For things like giving advice, Leng Sanye never thinks about it, he is Leng Erye's gun.       The two of them also raised a group of people with martial arts, although these people are not masters, but they are more than enough to look at the family care home or deal with some shady things.       In the inn in Lotus Town, it was already late at night, and Leng Feng was sitting cross-legged on the bed. His eyes were closed, and an invisible cyclone was swimming around his body. Leng Feng fell into a wonderful state again, as if his body did not exist between this heaven and earth, and as if this heaven and earth were all part of his body.       Innate state!       This is the second time that Leng Feng's cultivation of innate divine skills has entered this state, and the interval between the two is less than ten days, which shows how powerful Leng Feng's talent is. But Leng Feng himself didn't feel it, he was immersed in this state, and seemed to forget everything.       In fact, his senses are incomparably wonderful, and he can feel any movement from a hundred meters away.       The cyclone produced by cultivating the innate divine skills in the body was growing rapidly, gradually producing a faint golden color.Suddenly, Leng Feng's heart suddenly became alarmed, and he suddenly opened his eyes. The previous feeling faded like a tide, and a sense of loss rose in my heart. The feeling of being interrupted in his innate state made him very uncomfortable, but Leng Feng couldn't care about it at this time.       The Innate Divine Skill and the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demon Forging Divine Skill were running at the same time, and there were two different breaths flowing in the body. These two breaths are not mutually exclusive, but they do not merge together, but complement each other. Within the Innate Divine Skill Master, outside the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demon Forging Divine Masters, the combination of the two far exceeds one plus one equals two.       picked up the special operations repeater next to him, bent his body and bent one catapult, opened the window and pierced out like a tanuki.       Just now, Leng Qifeng suddenly felt a dangerous aura approaching. If it were under normal conditions, the cold front would not feel so obvious. This time he happened to enter the innate state, which improved his perception ability several times.       This killing intent is in the grove outside the inn, which is next to the backyard of the inn, which means that the person who wants to disadvantage him is lurking outside the inn.       After Leng Feng walked out of the window, he turned over directly, hooked the eaves of the inn with his feet, and then exerted his legs and waist together, and his body turned over on the roof like a spinning windmill. After arriving on the roof of the inn, Leng Feng did not make any further moves, but quietly lurked along the eaves.       In his previous life, as the king of soldiers of the special combat team, Leng Feng had performed countless dangerous missions, and he knew that only hunters lurking in the shadows were the most lethal. Hiding in the dark to give a fatal blow has far more effect than directly chasing the target.       Just after Leng Feng had just taken a breath from lurking, three black shadows appeared directly in front of his line of sight. The three shadows came out of the grove, and they climbed over the fence of the backyard and felt from the stable to the main house of the inn.       These people were very agile, and they didn't alarm the horses in the backyard at all, and after passing through the backyard like ghosts, they jumped over the wall. The movements of the three of them are neat and uniform, and at first glance they are well-trained people.       There was a one-story gap between the wall of the backyard and the building in the main courtyard, and after a brief look, the three of them turned over and jumped onto the roof again.       All of this was seen by Leng Feng, but he remained silent. Leng Feng understands that a hunter who can endure is a real good hunter. In this case, the three of them had already entered the killing range of the special repeater, and with Leng Feng's reaction speed, they could completely launch the crossbow arrows in an arrow magazine in an instant.       However, Leng Feng still didn't react, his eyes were still fixed on the three people. He wanted to see what the three of them wanted to do, after all, he was still very curious about the killers of this era.       The three men in black thought that they were doing very skillfully and no one noticed it, although they seemed to be cautious, their vigilance relaxed a lot.       It is this moment that Leng Feng is waiting for, and when the enemy relaxes his vigilance, it can be the best time to deliver a fatal blow. The trio stopped above Leng Feng's room, carefully uncovering the roof tiles and peering into the room.       Unfortunately, the lights had been extinguished when Leng Feng left the room, and his bed was covered with a veil. It is destined that these three people can't see the situation in bed at all, and can only judge by experience that the person in the bed is asleep.       I saw one of them take out a long incense, and the other slashed his arm in the air, and a bright spot flashed in the air.       "Suddenly!" The man blew sharply, and a faint fire erupted from the bright spot in his hand. It turned out that the man lit the fire fold and then lit the long incense.       Just as the three of them were engrossed in stuffing Changxiang into the roof, a sudden change occurred, and the nerves of the three of them suddenly tensed to the extreme, and an extremely dangerous aura enveloped the three of them.The next moment, the three of them had the feeling of falling into an ice cellar. Although he sensed danger, he could not dodge it at this time.       "Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!" Three consecutive sounds of breaking the sky sounded, and three cold flashes flashed in the dark night, and almost at the moment when the sound sounded, the three of them had a feeling of suffocation.       The next moment, they only felt a chill in their chests, and the spirit of their bodies dispersed like a deflated ball.       Slowly lowering their heads, they saw that all three of them had a crossbow bolt stuck in their chests. The bolt was dark and looked half thinner than the standard bolts used in the army. What frightened the three of them the most was the sharpness of the crossbow arrow, and when the tip of the arrow penetrated their bodies, they didn't even feel the slightest feeling.       If it weren't for the breastplate on their chests that jammed the tail of the arrow, they might not even have noticed what they had been hurt.       The sound of the bolts firing was faint, and the fact that it was night made it difficult for the black bolts to be detected. Coupled with the extremely fast speed of the crossbow arrows, the three of them had no defense, and when they were only ten meters apart, they had no time to dodge.       The eyes of the three of them flashed with unwillingness, and they didn't even notice the shadow of the enemy, so they hung up. However, Leng Feng would not fulfill the last wishes of these three people, and seeing that his three crossbow arrows had hit the vital points of those three people, he still lay there and did not move.       Seeing that the bodies of the three of them were weak, they fell down one after another, and then suddenly jumped out of the hiding place. Just when the bodies of the three people were about to touch the roof, Leng Feng had already come to the front of the three people.       Before the consciousness of the three people was about to disappear completely, it seemed that they felt that someone was approaching them, but when they had already seen the faces of the people who came, a great confusion suddenly rose in their hearts.       "Leng Dashao! How could it be him? ”
       However, they no longer had time to figure out the reason, and their consciousness was completely plunged into darkness.       Leng Feng didn't want to alarm the others now, so he would see the opportunity to rush out. The bodies of the three men were gently placed on the roof, and then the tiles on the roof of their house were restored. As for the bodies of the three people, Leng Feng didn't move them elsewhere, but just pulled out three crossbow arrows from their bodies.       Since the Special Operations Repeater is fired in a rotation, as long as it hits the target, it will deal huge damage to the target. If it's a hit, it's a direct hit. This is also the reason why the vitality of the three people is lost immediately after they are hit by arrows.       The bolts are undamaged and can be used again after cleaning.       Leng Feng turned over, cleaned the crossbow bolts with water in the yard, and quietly climbed into the house through the window. It's not that Leng Feng has a special fetish, but that the wooden doors of this era are too loud, and the windows are not sound.       Since it was the second half of the night, the people in the inn were sleeping soundly, and there was not much movement before, so it didn't alarm anyone.Encountering this incident, Leng Feng had no intention of cultivating anymore. Fortunately, he cultivated the innate divine skills before passing through, and he didn't feel a little sleepy.       As for who sent those three people, Leng Feng didn't need to dig deeper, after all, he was not stupid, and he could see that the target of those three people was him. This is also the reason why Leng Feng made a decisive sneak attack, he is not a person who kills indiscriminately, if the target of those people is not him, Leng Feng will hide on the side and watch the show at most.       After calming down, Leng Feng lay on the bed and didn't go to cultivation anymore, nor did he sleep directly, he began to recall his experience of traveling into this world.       Although it has not been long since he has traveled to this world, he has begun to adapt to this new role. All of this is thanks to the special forces experience in his previous life, which allows him to quickly adapt to any environment.       When he had just crossed over, he had already thought about life once. At that time, he had already recognized the reality and decided to live a more wonderful life in this world. But after these days, his thinking is more nuanced.       Leng Feng knows his strengths and weaknesses, he is not the kind of all-powerful crossing protagonist, and it is impossible to have any awesome skills. After all, in his previous life, he was just a special forces king, not a technology maniac. Fortunately, he has gone through nine years of compulsory education, he has a wide range of interests and hobbies during his school years, and has experienced four years of military training, so he still has a lot of modern knowledge.       However, there are some aspects that are not his shortcomings, for example, this society based on agriculture is not his strong point in agriculture. He will not farm and will not develop high-tech agriculture.       He knew that the agricultural productivity of this era was low, and his family was a big landowner, so he was naturally very clear about the yield per acre. Even if Leng Dashao didn't know anything about it before, but in the past few days, Leng Feng has already inquired about it clearly.       The acres of land in this era are slightly less than those in the era when Leng Feng lived, one acre of land is equivalent to about 590 square meters, and one acre of land in modern times is about 666 square meters. In this era, one acre of fertile land can produce more than 300 catties of wheat in a bumper year, and if it is rice, it can reach about 400 catties.       This kind of agricultural output is not much, but compared with the population of this era, coupled with the abundant natural resources, as long as there is no major famine, it should not be a problem to solve the problem of food and clothing.       However, due to the incompetence of the rulers and the invasion of foreign races, the life of the common people was generally very difficult.       Leng Feng doesn't understand agriculture, but he also knows that the development of agriculture is inseparable from seeds, fertilizers, and machinery. He doesn't know how to breed, but in his previous life he visited a modern agricultural base, and coincidentally he heard experts about the process of how to breed hybrid rice.       He didn't pay attention to the visit in his previous life, and he forgot about it soon after. Fortunately, after crossing into this era, he has a special ability, that is, the things he has been in contact with will be clearly displayed in his memory like a repeater.       The current season is not the time to breed hybrid rice, and it will be a little more than a month before we can start working on this aspect.       As for other high-yielding crops, such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, corn, etc., people can also collect seeds. These things multiply quickly, and it is believed that after a few rounds of sowing, a large number of seeds can be harvested.       Of course, he won't do these things himself, as long as he has established his own power, he can arrange for people to do it. Some of his knowledge and memories of his previous life were slowly copied in this era.The advantage of the cold front is in the military aspect, especially in the manufacture of advanced weapons that are ahead of this era. When the trouble of the family business is solved, he will devote himself to the development of this aspect.       He had to build a lot of weapons, but he was not a small landowner in the countryside.       After all, this is not as simple as him and Ah Hu tinkering with the two repeating crossbows, there are more things involved. The problem of resources must be solved, and a large number of craftsmen is also a big problem, and recruiting troops is also a problem.       Thinking about it this way, Leng Feng found that he would have to face a lot of problems in the future.       But now that he has a reputation, when he does something, he can justify it. This can solve some troubles to a certain extent, of course, when it is not enough to have fame, you must have actual power.       If it were not for the great natural and man-made disasters, the common people would not be able to do anything, and the folk careerists who had no foundation would not be able to succeed. I don't see the people who have achieved great things in many dynasties in history, and all of them are people with deep roots. As for the real self-made people, there are only a handful of them for thousands of years, and they are still in the right place at the right time.       Judging from the situation in the last years of the Southern Song Dynasty, there is no such possibility at all.       Leng Feng just lay on the bed thinking about the future, and when he thought about it, he found that it was really difficult. The so-called everything is difficult at the beginning, and Leng Feng is now at the beginning stage. To sum up, it is nothing more than a matter of money and power, and no matter what era it is, these two aspects are the key to the success or failure of things.       Unconsciously, Leng Feng thought a lot, and he already had a vague plan for the future in his heart.       An hour after Leng Feng shot the three of them, a warning once again rose in his heart. However, this time was different from the last time, although he felt something strange, but he did not have that strong sense of crisis.       This shows that what is going to happen next is not necessarily deliberately aimed at him.       Just as Leng Feng frowned, there was a sound of horses' hooves in the distance.       "Da, da!"       The sound goes from far to near, from indistinct to clear. It's not just the cold front, many people are already feeling it.       "Young master, young master, open the door!" Outside the door came the cry of Chai Bo.       "Chai Bo, what's wrong!" Fluttershy's voice is heard outside the door.       "Squeak!" Cold Front opens the door, and Chai Bo and Fluttershy immediately walk into Cold Front's room.       Leng Feng deliberately messed his hair messy, and his neatly dressed clothes were also pulled away by him. This is not to hide anything from them, but to avoid arousing the suspicion of others.       "Young Master, there may be danger! Hide these valuables first, and if you encounter any accidents, everything is about saving your life! Chai Bo's face was very unsightly at this time, and he already vaguely knew what was going to happen.       Fluttershy's face turns pale with horror when she hears this from Chai. Because of this kind of dense and urgent sound of horses' hooves, and it is in the middle of the night, it will definitely not be a good thing.       "Good!" Leng Feng nodded and said.       So, Chai Bo hid several valuable items in the wooden box in the room of the three of them.At this time, the other people in the inn were also awakened, because the sound of horses' hooves was already very close, and it would not take a few breaths to come to the inn.       The streets of Lotus Town were already restless at this time, the doors of many shops were rudely slammed open, and there were screams and screams in the darkness, and some people ran in a panic.       "Master, Fluttershy is keeping up! Later, if you are discovered by those bandits outside, don't talk nonsense! ”
       Chai Bo leads Leng Feng and Fluttershy to the back stable, and the movement is already obvious, and Chai Bo understands that they have been robbed by bandits.       It is not known how many bandits have come outside, and if they are found by the bandits in the guest room, the situation will be very bad. After all, these bandits not only raid homes and houses, but sometimes deliberately target people they deem valuable, or even kidnap tickets.       Chai Bo grabs a handful of plaster and applies it to Fluttershy's face, after all, the little girl looks like a beautiful billet and risks being ruined if she encounters inhuman bandits.       Fortunately, the three of Leng Feng kept a low profile along the way, and they were all wearing coarse linen clothes, and smearing a little dust on them was a good cover-up. Although Leng Feng was wearing a scholarly shirt, the fabric of his clothes was also very ordinary, and he didn't look like a rich scholar.       Coming to the backyard, Leng Feng pondered for a while, and then stuffed the special repeater under the hay in the stable.       The situation is not clear, whether this wave of bandits came to fight the autumn wind, or burned, killed and looted, it is difficult to say.       The most important thing is that Leng Feng doesn't want to expose his strength yet. When he used a special repeater to shoot the three killers before, Leng Feng understood that these three people were coming for him. Although the strength of those three killers is not as good as Leng Feng, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no more powerful people to deal with him later.       However, Leng Feng doesn't get his face dirty like Fluttershy, because he is dressed like an ordinary scholar. The ordinary scholars of this era are worthless in the eyes of these bandits.       At this moment, I suddenly heard a loud bang at the door of the inn.       There was a thud, and the door was kicked open from the outside. Then he rushed into a dozen or so big men, under the light of a few torches. I saw that these people had black scarves wrapped around their brains, and they all looked fierce and vicious.       The first man was a stout man with a huge axe on his shoulder. The handle of the axe is more than a meter long, and the axe is the size of a human brain. Judging from the sound of the footsteps, the weight of this axe is definitely not light.       The rest of the people also carried their blades in their hands, shining in the light of the fire.       "Listen, grandpa, I only want money and don't kill you! Hand over all the money, otherwise, Hugh blames grandpa's axe for recognizing money and not people
       The strong man shouted angrily, and the little minions behind him immediately rushed up to the guest room on the second floor.       At this moment, several more people came in from outside, and they ran towards the stable in the backyard.       All of a sudden, there was a sound of people turning their backs in the inn. After a while, the shopkeeper and his men and the guests of the hotel were all taken down tremblingly.       Leng Feng and the three were also driven from behind by the bandits, in addition to the three Leng Feng, there were also seven or eight people who lived in the backyard stable, these people were the porters of the two waves of merchants who drove the carriage.       About thirty or so people were driven by these bandits in the courtyard of the inn, and the rest of the bandits were still rummaging through the inn.Leng Feng's big wooden box was also turned over by them, but these bandits were all big and coarse, and the target they were looking for was only gold, silver and jewelry, and after turning out a dozen taels of silver in the box, they threw away other things.       Those few pieces of calligraphy and painting antiques, they didn't pay attention to it. Chai Bo's collection is very ingenious, and the calligraphy and paintings are hung directly in the guest room, disguised as decorations.       It can be seen that Chai Bo still knows the temperament of these bandits very well. In the early years, when he followed Leng Da Rich Man to do business, he had dealt with these bandits.       There are also several types of bandits, and most of the bandits still pay attention to a certain morality and will not do those things that kill chickens and take eggs. After all, for these bandits, the object of robbery by them is equivalent to their food and clothing, and if they exterminate everyone at one time, it is equivalent to cutting off their own financial routes.       Most people in business will come to an agreement with the bandits who are entrenched everywhere and pay a certain amount of money as a road fee.       Less moral are the rogues and bandits, who commit crimes everywhere, not only doing the business of robbing homes and houses, because the scope of their activities is not fixed, they will not only rob people of money, but sometimes also kill people.       The third group is the most immoral bandits, and this part of the bandits is made up of outlaws. They will not take action easily, as long as they are targeted by them, they will pursue a three-light policy: rob the light, kill the light, and burn it all.       Looking at the style of this group of bandits, it is very similar to the second type of rogue bandits. Whenever these people go to a place to rob, they pay attention to fast in and out, only grabbing some gold and silver, soft and easy to carry things, and leaving immediately after grabbing.       "Three masters, there are a lot of horses in the backyard!" A small minion rushed out of the backyard and shouted.       "I can pull it all over as a mount!" With a bang, the strong man put the axe into the ground, and the ground was shaken.       "You people are honest with Grandpa, hand over all the money happily, if Grandpa finds out that someone is hiding it, see if your head is hard or this stake is hard?"       After speaking, the strong man picked up his axe and slashed it at the half-human-high wooden stake with the thickness of a basin beside him. With a click, the stake was divided into two sections in the middle.       This is an old locust tree, this kind of tree is very tough, this axe can go down, can directly split the stake in half, it can be seen that this person's strength is absolutely extraordinary. Coupled with his fierce and vicious appearance, the shock is absolutely powerful.       The shopkeeper and the guys of the inn were even more frightened and trembling, they had experienced the last banditry, and knew that the previous shopkeeper and the guys were killed by the bandits, and they had an instinctive fear of the bandits in their hearts. At this time, in the face of such fierce bandits, how can you not be worried and afraid?       "Someone has escaped!" Another shout was heard.       It turned out that when some bandits went to the backyard to choose horses, they found that there was a small door in front of them, and the four dart riders had escaped on horseback from the small gate in the backyard. This exclamation attracted the attention of the bandits in the front yard. As bandits who robbed houses, they naturally knew the doorway, and those who could escape on horseback in such a situation must have a lot of property with them.       "Go after it! Inform the second master to go with you. The three masters immediately arranged for someone to chase after the four escaped dart masters.       Several bandits rushed out of the courtyard and turned on their horses and chased them across the street. At the same time, the sound of horses' hooves sounded outside the street, and it seemed that the bandits outside had received the news and rushed after the four dart masters.       At this time, the bandits who were still in Lotus Town were still robbing houses and looting gold and silver property. Some merchants and shops are the targets they focus on, and this inn is a relatively large target in Lotus Town, so it is naturally targeted by these bandits.There are still more than a dozen bandits here, and Leng Feng can see that there is a bit of kung fu on this third master. However, the three masters do not rely on kung fu to eat, but mainly rely on his brute force to bluff people. As for the other bandits, they are only slightly stronger than ordinary people.       Through the observation of this meeting, Leng Feng also had a general understanding of the strength of these bandits. Without the use of special repeaters, these ten bandits were able to clean up. However, in this way, it is bound to expose its own strength, and it will also attract the attention of other bandits.       At this time, Leng Feng already had a plan in his heart, not to resist first, and let these bandits rob him. As long as these bandits don't make killings, he won't show his strength.       After these bandits leave, he will secretly follow, if he finds that the number of these bandits is not too much, relying on the cover of night to use special crossbows to carry out a sneak attack, there is a great certainty that these bandits will be eliminated.       Of course, Leng Feng is not a person who kills indiscriminately, he wants to see if these bandits are extremely vicious, and decide whether they will kill them.       "You, come here!"       With a finger of the right hand of the third master, the shopkeeper of the inn was already so frightened that his legs were sifted, and he sat on the ground with his buttocks.       "Don't, don't kill me, I'll give you all the money!"       "Coward!"       The third leader of the bandit strode up to the shopkeeper, grabbed him by the back of the neck and lifted him up: "Go and take out all the money you have hidden for grandpa!" ”
       Then he threw it casually and threw the shopkeeper on the ground. Two bandits came up and set up the shopkeeper and dragged him to the inn.       The other bandits were also preparing to search everyone, but fortunately, Leng Feng and the few people who had been driven out of the backyard stayed on the other side and did not attract the attention of these bandits.       The bandits thought that the people who lived in the backyard were just a few people who didn't have any oil or water on them. It seems that Chai Bo is really an experienced old man who knows the psychology of these bandits.       The reason why I threw some silver in the inn was also to take care of the emotions of these bandits. In this way, they find some silver in the chest, so that they do not destroy the contents of the house in a fit of rage.       These are all experiences that the average person would never have imagined.       The bandits' ability to collect their belongings is not bad, and most of them have already looted their belongings. And there was a basket of lorries on the ground, and in it there was already half a basket of gold and silver.       "Heroes, please spare the little old man! According to the rules, I have paid you enough tolls along the way, and our family is still counting on this batch of goods to be alive! ”
       By this time, the bandits had already received the body of one of the merchants, who was bulging in his arms, and it was obvious that he was hiding something.       "Old thing, don't be embarrassed, hand over the things quickly!"A small bandit raised his broadsword and put it at the merchant's neck. The merchant clutched the things in his arms, even the knife in the face of the bandits, and did not let go.       "Poof!"       Suddenly, there was the sound of a sharp weapon piercing through his flesh, and the merchant immediately appeared on his chest with a spear head, and he stared at the tip of the spear with round eyes, and a gurgling sound came out of his mouth. Even the little bandit who threatened him with a knife was also taken aback, and he didn't expect his companion to suddenly kill him.       "What a rambling thing! If you don't kill it, it's it! The bandit said coldly.       After saying that, the bandit pulled out his gun with a hard blow. The merchant slashed down with the bandit's movements, and after falling to the ground, he twitched twice and stopped moving.       "Take it out and see what it is?" The bandit who stabbed people with a gun said.       The little bandit turned the merchant's body over, took out a small wooden box from the man's arms, and opened it to see that it was full of gold leaves. This gold leaf is made of gold of high purity, and it looks very beautiful.       "Damn it!"       Leng Feng saw that these bandits had killed people, and his killing intent also rose in his heart. He didn't expect that these bandits would kill people when they said they would. And looking at the murderous actions of these bandits, he knew that these bandits were definitely carrying a lot of human lives.       "You have all seen it, this is the end of loving money but not life!" The bandit leader didn't take it seriously, and in his opinion, killing a few people was nothing at all. And this is also their usual method, killing people is used to deter others.       Sure enough, no one dared to discooperate next, as long as these bandits came to the front, they immediately took out the money on their bodies.       After a while, there was another sound of horses' hooves outside the door, and it turned out that the bandits who had gone to chase the four dart masters turned back.       "Poof"       A burden was thrown to the ground with a dull sound. The burden spread out, and four round things fell out, which turned out to be four bloody human heads.       "These four guys are not honest, and their brothers have broken five people. However, the heads of these four guys were also cut off, which can be regarded as revenge for the brothers! ”
       A strong man with a big knife and a large package walked in, and this person was the second leader of this gang of bandits.       It seems that the four dart masters did not run away and were robbed by these bandits. In the course of the fight, they killed five bandits, but they were also killed by the bandits.       It can be seen that these bandits are by no means good. Although they are not the kind of bandits who do not leave chickens and dogs wherever they pass, they can be regarded as murderous without blinking, and they will draw their knives and kill people if they don't agree with each other.       "Grandma's, the oil and water here are not small, but I didn't expect that there are hard stubble, and there are a few brothers in this small place!" As soon as the three masters heard this, they immediately shouted loudly, stepped forward and kicked a brain generation away.This murderous appearance frightened many people in the courtyard and screamed.       "Ahh
       "It's not like it's not without harvest, these four guys are fat sheep!"       After the second master finished speaking, he threw out another burden in his hand with a bang. Bags of gold and silver jewellery were scattered from the baggage, and even at night, they glittered in the light of the fire.       No wonder the four dart masters were running away before, this bag was definitely worth a lot of money. It seems that these four people also escorted this batch of gold, silver and jewelry lightly this time, but unfortunately they were unlucky, and they did not attract the attention of those robbers along the way, but they were robbed by the robbers in this lotus town, not only lost their property, but also lost their own lives.       "Hahaha, I've made a fortune, it's enough for the brothers to be happy for a while!" When the three masters saw the gold, silver and jewelry in one place, they laughed.       "Let the brothers be happy, and leave before dawn!" The second leader of the bandits also laughed and said.       "Brothers, hurry up and gather these belongings together, and give everyone half an hour to have fun for themselves!"       So the bandits, under the command of the two chiefs, put all the looted goods into the basket, and piled up nearly a basket of gold, silver, soft and other items. The bandit leader had a brute force to use, only to see him pinch the big axe to his waist, and hold Luo Basket with both hands.       The rest of the bandits rushed towards the homes of the residents of Lotus Town with their weapons on their shoulders in twos and threes. As for what they were looking for, it was nothing more than to plague the women of good families in this town.       Since the inn is full of men, the only woman is Fluttershy. Because Chai Bo had smeared a lot of dust on her face before, and the little girl's figure was not plump, it didn't attract the attention of these bandits.       The inn was ransacked by the bandits, and they stopped paying attention to it. The shopkeeper and the two fellows, although not hurt, were frightened, and after the bandits left, the three of them were still paralyzed on the ground and did not get up.       Someone in this inn was killed by bandits, and everyone felt as if they had been shut down by the ghost gate. Even if the bandits leave here for the time being, it doesn't mean that they are completely out of danger in everyone's eyes. These bandits also committed murder in Lotus Town, and almost all the gold, silver, and money on the innkeeper and the guests staying in the inn were robbed by the bandits, and everyone ran in panic.       The first thing that many people think of is to see how much they have left after the bandits' robbery.       After all, not everything can be looked at by bandits, these bandits are rogue bandits, and they only grab some gold and silver. And some of the goods carried by these merchants were bulky, and they did not rob them.       Except for the merchant who was killed earlier, and the four dart masters who lost a lot of money, the money loss of the others was not so serious.       Of course, the inn's savings have also been lost in the recent past. After all, there are no banks in this era, and most people like to hide their money at home, which is cheaper for these bandits.       Leng Feng and the three of them also quickly rushed back to the guest room, only to find that their boxes had all been ripped over by the bandits. The dozen taels of silver that had been left in the box were taken away by the bandits, and clothes and other supplies were also thrown all over the ground.       Fortunately, the antique calligraphy and paintings that were hidden before did not attract the attention of these bandits. Only one vase was knocked over by the bandits, but coincidentally, the vase was placed at the head of the bed at the time, and it fell right on the bed without being damaged.       Chai Bo put the things back in the wooden box, but instead of closing the wooden box, he threw his clothes in the box. It looks similar to when the bandits left, and this is mainly to prevent the bandits from coming back again.The carriage in the backyard was also intact, and because the carriage of Leng Feng's family was relatively old, the bandits couldn't look at it. Moreover, the horse pulling the cart was also a thin horse, which did not meet the requirements of these bandits for mounts.       However, almost all the horses brought by the other two waves of merchants were pulled away by the bandits. After all, the horses used by these merchants to walk outside were all relatively good on their feet.       After some panic, everyone hid back in their rooms.       At this time, the streets of Lotus Town were full of bandits. The inn has been robbed by bandits before, and there is no woman who can attract these bandits, so it is safest to hide in the inn at this time.       If you want to escape, once you encounter bandits outside, then there is a good chance that you will be hacked to death by the other party.       Leng Feng repeated his old trick again and climbed out of the window. However, this time he did not go directly to the roof, but went to the hay pile in the backyard and took out the special repeater that he had hidden under the hay.       The hay pile was also toppled by the bandits, but because the target of the special repeater was too small, and Leng Feng hid the special repeater close to the ground, it was not discovered by the bandits.       At this time, more than a dozen people living in the backyard were trembling and huddled into two piles. They only saw Leng Feng's figure flashing by the haystack in the backyard, and they didn't even see what Leng Feng looked like.       After getting the special repeater, Leng Feng turned over the wall. Although it has only been ten days since he has just crossed over to this era, Leng Feng's physical strength at this time has already surpassed the peak moment of his previous life.       The twelve heavenly gods and demons forging divine skills and innate divine skills he cultivated were all shocking existences. Maybe it's because Leng Dashao is indeed a one-in-a-million martial arts wizard, or because of the welfare of the traverser, in short, Leng Feng has shown excellent talent in cultivating these two exercises.       In a very short period of time, these two exercises have been cultivated, and the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons have strengthened his physique, and a special force has been generated in his body, which can adapt to a variety of environments. The innate divine skill makes the breath in the body endless, and the degree of vigor and staying power of the breath has been increased several times.       If you change it to ordinary exercises, it is difficult to reach this level without twenty or thirty years of hard cultivation. Just like the killers he killed before, this is the case.       In this world, there are differences between people. The so-called equality of all people is just an ideal slogan.       The roof of the inn was the tallest building in Lotus Town, and although it was still night, the light of torches flickered everywhere due to the arrival of these bandits.       Leng Feng could clearly see the distribution of these bandits, and at this time, many bandits had already broken into the homes of residents. The screams of women came out of the house, mixed with the unbridled laughter of the bandits, the angry roars of some men, and the wails of wounded people.       At this moment, the entire Lotus Town was completely chaotic. Some residents did not give up resistance in order to protect their wives and daughters from the bandits, but where they were the bandits' opponents, some people were soon cut down by the bandits.       Leng Feng spotted a target, and with a whoosh, a crossbow arrow flew over. Originally, the sound of the special repeater was very low, mixed with the noise, and no one noticed it at all."Poof! Burst! Two inaudible sounds of sharp arrows entering the flesh sounded in succession.       The family was a newly married couple, and the man had been knocked to the ground by the bandits, tied up with ropes, and was wailing on the ground. The three bandits were tearing at a young woman's clothes with excitement, and one of them had ripped off his pants, revealing the ugly thing between his legs.       The naked bandit laughed as he grabbed the young woman by the hair. At that moment, he was pierced through the neck by a sharp arrow, and the laughter in his mouth stopped abruptly. The crossbow bolt pierced the bandit's neck and then into the chest of another bandit, still barely exhausted, and shot through the chest and into the wall.       Leng Feng had already landed in the courtyard of this family at this time, and the powerful power of the crossbow arrows at such a close range made the two bandits return to the west before they could react.       Another bandit was looking down at the young woman's pants when he suddenly looked up, only to find one of his two companions covering his neck with his hands, blood pouring out. The other man's hand was on his chest, and blood was also gushing from his chest.       Before the bandit could react to what was going on, he felt his gaze suddenly shift in a different direction, and he could hear a crisp snapping sound of bones in his ears.       And then, there was no then! The consciousness of the three of them drifted almost at the same time.       It turned out that at the moment when the person was stunned, Leng Feng quickly rushed into the room and broke the neck of the last bandit.       In this case, it is possible to break each one. This time, there were quite a few bandits who entered Lotus Town to rob, and Leng Feng took a cursory look, and there were already more than a hundred people.       Among these bandits, there are also people with strong martial arts, in addition to the second and third masters that Leng Feng saw before, there is also a person riding a high-headed horse. This person was surrounded by more than a dozen bandits, and the aura on his body was much stronger than that of the second and third masters, and it seemed that this person was the boss of the bandits.       If he faced any of these three people alone, Leng Feng would not be afraid of them, and even if he was defeated, he would be able to retreat calmly. But once these three people were combined, coupled with the siege of other bandits, Leng Feng felt that he was no match for these people.       After taking out the three bandits, Leng Feng casually pulled out the crossbow arrows that had been shot at the wall. He then picked up a blade dropped by one of the bandits, broke the rope that bound the man, and then disappeared into the night.       Next, Leng Feng concocted the same method to eliminate more than a dozen bandits.       In this chaotic situation, no one noticed Leng Feng, the reaper who wandered in the dark night. He was like a grim reaper, and every time he appeared in a house, one or more bandits were destroyed by him.       In this era, Leng Feng will not be the kind of chivalrous man with a strong sense of justice. The so-called chivalrous man is for the country and the people! That was Leng Feng's belief in life when he was a special soldier.       But in this troubled world, it is difficult for him to reach this, after all, in his bones, he is not a person of this era, and his sense of identity is not so strong.What Leng Feng can do is to be poor and be alone, and to be good at the world. Leng Feng felt that he was far from reaching the strength to help the world now, and it would be good to be able to protect himself.       However, Leng Feng couldn't see those bandits doing such evil deeds under his nose, this is the basic principle and bottom line of being a human being. He didn't stop those bandits from killing people before, firstly, because it was too late for him to stop them, and secondly, because bandits robbing is a matter of course, and if they don't rob bandits, they won't be called bandits.       Just like a wolf traveling thousands of miles to eat meat, this is a special phenomenon created by the times.       However, after the robbery, it is necessary to plague the common people, so it is no longer possible to stand idly by.       Suddenly, Leng Feng's brows furrowed, and his body quickly rushed to the left. Although Leng Feng was secretly dealing with these bandits, after all, one person's ability was limited, and it was impossible to save all of them.       And Leng Feng didn't stay away from the inn, he hunted these bandits according to the center of the inn. In this way, he was able to protect the safety of the people in the inn to the greatest extent. At the same time, if something happens in the inn, he can also rush back as soon as possible.       At this time, to the left of Leng Feng was the inn, and he could feel that there seemed to be something strange on the side of the inn. Although the voice was not loud, Leng Feng's innate divine skill perception was extremely keen, and this movement could not be hidden from him.       Leng Feng is not as unscrupulous as bandits, he has always been very careful, carefully observing the movements around him all the time. After all, he is a hunter who lurks in the shadows, and only by mastering everything around him can he receive the best results.       In less than two breaths, Leng Feng came to the inn.       The sound came from the second floor of the inn, and it turned out that there were bandits who broke into the inn again during the time Leng Feng left. There were a lot of bandits who entered Lotus Town this time, and many of them didn't know what was going on here. However, they basically knew that the goal of the three masters was here, but they couldn't stop some bandits from patronizing here again, after all, in the eyes of some bandits, the oil and water of the inn were relatively large.       After all, Lotus Town is just a small place, and there are no large shops. Even if it's already robbed, maybe something valuable will be left behind.       You know, what was looted before belonged to all bandits. Now it's free time, whoever grabs it is who's whoever.       Coincidentally, after these people rushed to the second floor, they rushed directly to Leng Feng's room.       But just as they were about to push the door open, a dagger directly slit the throat of the bandit who reached out and pushed the door. Then there was a flash of cold light, and the throat of another bandit was slit again.       The movement of the death of the two bandits finally alarmed the others, and the remaining bandits also rushed towards a thin figure with this guy.       The figure held a sharp dagger in his hand, and his hands were extremely nimble.       Although this figure looks thin, its strength is not small, the steps under its feet appear to be agile and elegant, and the angle of the shot is also very tricky. Seven or eight bandits couldn't touch the corners of his clothes at all, and in just a breath or two, all of them were put to the ground. Everyone had a hole in their neck, all of them had their throats cut out, and there was a gurgling sound of air leaking.       When Leng Feng arrived here, he only found a corpse in one place. He frowned and looked around, but found nothing else out of the ordinary.       It seems that the battle here started quickly and ended quickly.Leng Feng knew in his heart that if it were him, it would not be impossible to deal with these seven or eight bandits in a breath or two, but it would cause even greater movement. In other words, Leng Feng has the strength to deal with these bandits, but his skills are not as agile as the other party.       What Leng Feng didn't know was that the figure that disappeared before was hiding not far from the inn, dressed in tattered clothes, his face was covered with dust, and he still couldn't see his face clearly. This person was the little beggar who asked Leng Feng to invite him to eat chicken before, and beside the little beggar, there were two beggars, who were covered in dirt and splashed a lot of blood.       "Young helper, brothers will be here soon!" One of the beggars said.       "Okay, inform the brothers to fence up Lotus Town, and none of these bandits can be let go!"       It turns out that the identity of these beggars is not simple, they are not ordinary beggars, but the legendary beggar gang disciples. The little beggar who asked Leng Feng to invite him to eat chicken before turned out to be the young leader of the beggar gang. And looking at the way they talked, it seemed that a large group of people were about to rush over.       "Young gang leader, someone has secretly done something to these bandits!" Another beggar said.       "Do you know who it is?"       "I haven't found it for the time being, but I don't think that person's strength is weak, it's all a one-hit kill!" The beggar continued to report.       "Don't worry about him for the time being, since this person has attacked the bandits, it means that he is also a righteous man. We're going to follow the plan, we're going to wipe out all of these bandits! ”
       The two beggars, instructed by the little beggar, soon disappeared into the night. The little beggar's eyes looked in the direction of the inn's gate again, and he muttered to himself: "I said that I would repay you, and I can't let people hurt you!" ”
       Leng Feng didn't expect that he invited the little beggar to have a meal, and the other party was really a person who knew how to repay his kindness, and helped him solve these bandits in time. Although these bandits Cold Front can also deal with it, if they are allowed to break into Chai Bo and Fluttershy's room, I don't know what the consequences will be.       If Leng Feng knew that this was done by the little beggar, he would definitely sigh with emotion, and sure enough, there is still a good person with a good reward.       Although Leng Feng rushed back relatively quickly, he didn't see how these bandits were eliminated. It's just that from the wound in the throat of the other party, it can be seen that the person who killed these bandits is a master.       He is about to throw the bandits' bodies downstairs when he hears a creak, and a crack opens in the doors on both sides, and Chai Bo and Fluttershy walk out at the same time.       "Young master, are you alright?" The two of them asked almost at the same time.       "It's okay, what's going on with these bandits?" Leng Feng asked. It's not that he's pretending not to know, it's really not knowing.       "I don't know, I just heard a sound of footsteps." Fluttershy says.       "Quick, throw away the corpses of these bandits! Otherwise, it will be bad for other bandits to find out! Chai Bo looked at the corpse of the bandit on the ground, and his face suddenly changed.       Leng Feng had thought of this before, but he thought about it more. Because there have been several waves of bandits that he has dealt with before, the bodies of those bandits outside will be sent sooner or later.Does this mean that although I saved those people just now, it is also equivalent to indirectly harming them?       Because once the body of the bandit is found by other accomplices, those families will not escape the fate of being destroyed.       In Leng Feng's opinion, the people who killed these bandits made the same mistake as him, and only thought that by killing the bandits, they would be able to save people. But he didn't expect that if he couldn't kill all these bandits, then it would attract revenge from other bandits.       Unless the bandits outside have no time to take care of the corpses of these killed bandits, or the remaining bandits are all wiped out.       In fact, Leng Feng thought too much, and the little beggar left this loophole because he didn't treat it as a loophole at all. In his plan, the other bandits could soon be eliminated as well.       From the time Leng Feng decided to make a move, he had destroyed more than a dozen bandits with only half a burnt of incense.       However, in his opinion, it should be difficult to kill all those bandits within half an hour. If the person who secretly shot it can also have the same mind as him, then it is not impossible to do so. Judging from the wounds of these bandits, that person's strength should not be weak.       Leng Feng didn't know the identity of the other party, nor did he know the other party's plans, he could only judge from what he knew.       Because over time, the greater the chance of exposure. He is not afraid of those ordinary bandits, he can use the terrain to deal with those bandits, and shoot them one by one. But the three bandit leaders are all good at martial arts, and once they are surrounded and beaten, it will be a headache.       Of course, Leng Feng will not pin his hopes on an unknown person.       In order not to waste time, he threw all the corpses of these bandits downstairs one by one, and as for whether to alarm the others, he didn't care about it at this time.       Chai Bo and Fluttershy are also frightened by Leng Feng's strength, they and Leng Dashao can be said to get along with the sunset, but they have never found Leng Dashao to have such strength.       However, Leng Feng didn't explain to them, just said that the situation was dangerous, and then let them hide again.       Fortunately, the people who killed these bandits were extremely clever, only cut the bandits' trachea, did not touch the major arteries, and there were almost no blood stains on the ground.       Cold Front tells Chai Bo and Fluttershy back into the room, and he slips out again.       This time, he's ready to go on a killing spree. However, as soon as he jumped on the roof, he saw dark shadows surrounding Lotus Town.       Seeing this situation, Leng Feng's heart couldn't help but chuckle.       In the face of one hundred and ten stragglers, Leng Feng was confident that he would use certain means to eliminate them. But there are so many people out there that there's no end in sight. Even if his strength is several times stronger, there is nothing he can do.However, Leng Feng knows that the more critical he is, the more he can't panic, and only by being calm can he find a way to solve the problem, and what is tested at this time is a person's state of mind.       Leng Feng's gaze looked carefully around Lotus Town, and the opportunity to escape was not found, but it allowed him to discover these anomalies. Although it was not clear who those dense figures were, they could see that they had surrounded the three outer layers of Lotus Town.       The actions of so many people did not make any noise, which shows that the organizational ability and strength of these people should not be weak. The bandits in Lotus Town hadn't noticed anything unusual at this time, and they were soon surrounded.       Seeing this, Leng Feng's heart was a little relieved.       He felt that these people were aimed at those bandits, after all, Leng Feng was also a person who had passed through a rain of bullets, and this kind of scene made it easy for him to make a judgment. If it was really as he suspected, then the crisis of bandits might be lifted.       The force that can encircle and suppress bandits in this era is likely to be the army of the government. Leng Feng felt that this was a good opportunity to see how effective the army was in this era.       But as soon as the two sides fought, Leng Feng found that his guess was so wrong. These people are not the army of the government at all, and they have nothing to do with the army.       Just as Leng Feng was thinking, the people who surrounded Lotus Town outside had already launched an attack on the bandits inside Lotus Town.       At this time, most of the bandits broke into the homes of the residents, either plundering property or chasing women. Where did they think that at this time someone would come to kill them, as soon as they came into contact, these bandits were killed a lot of people.       With the glow of the fire, Leng Feng realized at this time that the people who surrounded Lotus Town were not the army of the government, but beggars in tattered clothes.       Although these beggars are dressed in tatters, most of them only carry sticks in their hands. However, due to their large numbers, there are often more than a dozen beggars surrounding a bandit, and many of these beggars are also skilled in martial arts, and as soon as the two sides come into contact, they form a crushing trend against the bandits.       This movement also attracted the attention of the bandits, and a low horn sounded. The bandits, who were acting recklessly, heard the sound of the horn, dropped their things one by one, grabbed their weapons and rushed out.       At this moment, the scene became even more chaotic. Leng Feng knew the truth of fishing in troubled waters, and began to feel outside along the eaves.       If the little beggar staring at the inn hadn't left at this time, he would definitely have been able to spot Leng Feng's movements. However, as the young leader of the beggar gang, he was already surrounded by several beggars and sneaked towards the place where the two sides were fighting. Along the way, they encountered lone bandits, and they killed them mercilessly.       Leng Feng also didn't notice the little beggar, and the two of them had the opposite line of action. The target of the cold front is not the front line of the battle between the two sides, but the position of the bandit leader.       Leng Feng had seen it before, these people had robbed a lot of money, especially the merchant who was killed, and the treasure escorted by the four dart masters, which was a lot of wealth for him now. Leng Feng is not a money-greedy person, and under normal circumstances, he would not think about this treasure. But now these things have become ownerless and can be used as their own start-up capital.       Moreover, these bandits are doing the business of robbing houses and houses, and there must be a lot of good things in their hands. Looking at this array now, these bandits are in a catastrophe. Not only can you kill these bandits to eliminate harm for the people, but also get wealth, this deal is very cost-effective no matter how you look at it.       Soon, Leng Feng touched the location of the three bandit leaders.In a clearing, the three bandit leaders captured two sheep and roasted them on the fire.       There were also several jars of wine in front of him, and several young women were tied up next to them. It seems that these people are going to snatch these women away and become the ladies of the village, after all, they are not ordinary bandits, and it is normal for them to enjoy privileges.       Beside them, there was a large basket full of looted treasures. By this time, the treasures had been sorted, and the most precious things were placed in a wooden chest, which contained the gold leaves of the previous merchant, as well as a number of gold jewels.       In the basket were some broken silver and copper coins, which were large in number, but far less valuable than the small box. These things were distributed to the other bandits, and the contents of the small packages enjoyed by their three leaders.       The movement outside naturally alarmed the three of them, and they put down the food and drink in their hands, and ordered several bandits to start packing the looted things. Since this group of bandits are all lightly traveled, they are easy to carry when packed.       "Big boss, no! We are already surrounded! At this moment, one of the bandits stumbled over, covered in blood, and could not speak.       "Tell me, who's out there?" The bandit, known as the big boss, grabbed the man's neck and said viciously.       "Yes, a bunch of beggars! But there are too many of them, and there are many masters among them, and the brothers can't stop them! ”
       "Rice bucket! Isn't it just some stinky beggars, I thought they were officers and soldiers! They can't even stop them, so what's the use of you! The big boss shook it hard and threw the bandit aside.       "Hahaha, Tiger! Today you can't escape! ”
       Just as the big boss threw the bandit aside, a loud laugh came. Before the laughter fell, several figures quickly rushed to this side.       These people were also dressed as beggars, and although their clothes were tattered, they were very tattered.       It's not a false proposition, tattered is true, and chic is also true. There are several pockets sewn regularly on the tattered clothes, and the appearance of the pockets is also very uniform, ranging from one to three.       This is the special uniform of the beggar elders, and the number of pockets represents the rank of the elders. A pocket is the lowest elder, and the higher the number of pockets, the higher the status of the elder in the beggar gang.       "Feng Xiangyang! It turned out that it was you, the stinky Hanako, and the grandfather of the mountain tiger was going to slaughter your grandson today! ”
       The bandit boss looked at these beggars with a fierce expression on his face. Looking at this look, the big boss and these beggars have had a knot before.       "Mountain tiger, you are full of evil, today our beggar gang is going to eliminate harm for the people!" The elder of the beggar gang with three pockets on his body said, it seems that this person is Feng Xiangyang.       "I crossed the mountain and tiger gods to block and kill gods, and the Buddha blocked and killed Buddhas, if you want to eliminate harm for the people, it depends on whether you have the ability!"       "I let you escape last time, this time let's see where you can escape! Above! ”
       Since the two sides have a hostile relationship, it is useless to talk too much, everything still depends on the victory and defeat of the fists and feet, and of course, the difference between life and death.There are a total of six people on the beggar gang's side, and Feng Xiangyang is the elder of the three bags, with the highest status, and of course the strongest strength. And he had a holiday with the mountain tiger, and the two of them directly faced each other when they started, and the strength of these two people was almost the same, and they couldn't tell the winner in a short time.       The remaining two second-bag elders faced the bandit three masters. Although this reckless man only made the third position among the bandits, his strength was second only to that of the mountain tiger, and a large axe was danced by his hand, and this axe was so powerful that if it was touched by the axe, it would be smashed into a meatloaf.       Fortunately, the kung fu of the two elders of the beggar gang is not weak, although they dare not fight with the axe of the three bandits, but they are better at flexible moves, but they can entangle the three bandits.       The remaining three one-bag elders joined forces to besiege the second leader of the bandits, and the two sides were also evenly matched.       Leng Feng hid on the roof on one side, taking in the fight scene below. He could see that although there were only three people on the bandits' side, they were not weaker than the six people on the beggars' side.       In particular, the three bandit leaders are very fierce, and the two elders of the beggar gang are completely passive and beaten, and they don't dare to get close to each other's axes at all. If it weren't for the numerical advantage, these six would have been defeated.       But even so, the six elders of the beggar gang did not panic, they did not seek no merit but no fault, and fought quite conservatively. It seems that the real purpose of these six people is not to take down the three bandit leaders immediately, but to entangle them.       In this way, the two sides fought back and forth for dozens of rounds.       Several figures stumbled towards this direction under the light of the firelight. Their bodies were covered in blood, and behind these people, a large group of people were chasing after him.       In this meeting, the more than 100 bandits have been almost wiped out. Seeing that the tide was turning, the bandits began to flee.       Seeing this situation, the spirit of the six beggar gang elders was suddenly shocked. They were waiting for this opportunity, and after all the bandits outside were eliminated, the three bandit leaders were besieged and could not escape. And this time, in order to deal with the mountain tiger and the others, not only six elders were dispatched, but also other masters.       Naturally, the mountain tiger and others are not stupid, and when they see this situation, they know that it is not suitable to stay here for a long time.       "Second brother, third brother, you go quickly, I'll cut off the queen!"       The mountain tiger swung the long knife in his hand violently, forcing back Feng Xiangyang, who was fighting with him. Taking advantage of this gap, he quickly approached the second and third masters of the bandits.       "Big brother, you go first, and my second brother and I will break off for you." Seeing this scene, the three leaders of the bandits were stunned, and the axe in his hand was wielded by him like a wheel.       "Big brother, you go quickly, here is me and the third brother dragging, it's too late to be late!"       The second leader of the bandits also brandished the big knife in his hand even more wildly, and he was moved by the words of the big boss, and only at this critical time can he see the truth. Since the eldest brother wants to sacrifice his life to protect them, they also want to be the queen of the eldest brother.       "Big brother, go quickly, here is my second brother, these people can't stop you!" The three masters also shouted loudly.       Both of them are power-type masters, and their combat power is very strong, but their minds are also relatively simple. Seeing that the big boss wanted to cover the retreat of the two of them, they were all enthusiastic, and they felt that following such a big brother was the right person. So the brother's righteousness immediately broke out, and he wanted to stick a knife in the brother's ribs."Okay, worthy of being my good brother of the mountain tiger!" The mountain tiger said excitedly, "In this way, the eldest brother will go first!" ”
       The tiger grabbed the package containing the gold leaf, kicked his feet on the ground, and jumped towards the other end of Lotus Town like an arrow from a string.       Although Leng Feng was lying on the roof on the side, he could hear the conversation between the three of them clearly. originally thought that these three bandit leaders were really good brothers who shared honor and disgrace. But I didn't expect the turn to come so quickly, and this big boss is obviously the second master and the third master.       As soon as the second and third masters saw the performance of the eldest brother, their expressions were also suddenly stunned. They always felt that something was wrong there, but before they had time to think about it, several elders of the beggar gang had already launched an attack on them.       The target of the Three Bags Elder Feng Xiangyang is the Mountain Tiger, how can he escape easily. However, he didn't expect that the mountain tiger would play such a trick. It's such a time difference, and the tiger has rushed out far away.       The head of the third leader of the bandits had not yet turned a corner at this time, and he was bent on blocking the enemy for the boss so that he could run quickly. So an axe slashed towards Feng Xiangyang, even if Feng Xiangyang's martial arts were a head higher than the three bandits, he didn't dare to take his axe.       The third master is a typical person who was sold and counted the money for others.       However, after Feng Xiangyang was forced away by the axe of the three bandits, he lost the figure of the mountain tiger in his eyes. The nickname of the mountain tiger is not in vain, and his light skills are very good.       Seeing the figure of the mountain tiger disappearing into the night, and those beggar gang disciples were about to rush over, the second and third bandit leaders glanced at each other. After checking his eyes, he suddenly released a big move, and then turned around and ran.       The two of them are also very funny, after they slashed at each other, they took out the weapons in their hands and smashed them towards their opponents.       Taking advantage of the other party's dodging skills, he took a step and chased in the direction of the mountain tiger's escape. But unfortunately, they are destined to chase loneliness.       Leng Feng was hiding in the dark, seeing that this wave of operations was a bit of a feeling of not being able to keep up with the rhythm for a while, these bandits were really fucking talents.       But on second thought, the second and third leaders of this bandit are also quite smart. Although the weapons in the hands of the two of them were powerful, carrying such a weapon when they ran away would definitely affect their speed. It seems that these two people are not very smart, but they are still a little smart.       "Chase, don't let them run!" Feng Xiangyang greeted and chased after him with several other elders.       Just before the elders of the Beggar Gang left, Leng Feng had already quietly left the roof and chased in the direction of the mountain tiger's escape.       This guy is really cunning, if Leng Feng hadn't been hiding on the roof, he wouldn't have seen him bewitch everyone present.       Just now, when he climbed over the wall, he didn't continue to flee in the same direction. Instead, after a twist, he bypassed the beggars and fled from the direction that the beggars had attacked before.       The most dangerous place is the safest! Sure enough, it still makes sense.       The second and third leaders of the bandits thought that the big boss had fled in the original direction, but it became the opposite direction. The beggars who followed closely behind were also confused, so they all went in opposite directions. If there was no Leng Feng, the mountain tiger would have really escaped this catastrophe.       "A bunch of idiots!" The mountain tiger thought proudly in his heart as he fled.In his opinion, the so-called brotherhood is bullshit, and brothers are used to block arrows at critical times. Love is far less important than one's own life, what is it if these people are folded here, as long as they have money in their hands, they can naturally easily pull out a group of people again.       The mountain tiger patted his chest, where he had the confidence to make a comeback.       After the two sides left here, the beggar gang also arrived, and the little beggar who had asked Leng Feng to invite him to eat chicken walked out of the crowd.       "Young helper, what should I do with all this money?"       "Make a good count of the property looted by these bandits, we will take half of it and return the other half!"       With so many beggar gang disciples dispatched, they also suffered casualties. Although I came here with the purpose of eliminating harm for the people, I can't skip eating, right? If you take half of the money, you can at least return half of it, and it also protects the lives of the residents of the town.       This is far better than being robbed by bandits!       Taking half of the money is completely justified, after all, they are just beggars, not the government, and they are not obliged to do this.       Presumably, those who have been bullied by bandits, or whose families have been killed by bandits, would rather take out the money again to thank them for avenging their hatred.       "I'll leave these things to you, I'll go and see!" After giving these orders, the little beggar also followed in the direction that the six elders of the beggar gang had pursued.       Although his strength is not good, he is not experienced enough in the rivers and lakes, and he is also confused by the tricks of the mountain tiger.       At this time, the mountain tiger had escaped from the lotus town area and plunged into the woods on both sides. Not far from the woods were rolling hills, and as long as he ran into the middle of the forest, then it was safe.       At this time, the mountain tiger was ecstatic and had a feeling of the rest of his life. Although he kills like hemp, he doesn't want to be killed, so many people rush over, and one person can drown him with a mouthful of spit.       "Feng Xiangyang, remember this hatred of my mountain tiger, one day I will unscrew your brain generation as a night pot!" The mountain tiger said hatefully.       Thinking that he has been a tiger for so many years, how could he have suffered such a big loss! All the men and horses under his command are folded here, not to mention, and he almost lost his life. And the right-hand man who finally managed to flicker, in order to cover his escape, may also be folded here.       Of course, in the eyes of the Tiger, it was not his fault.       If people don't do it for themselves, heaven and earth will be destroyed!       Brothers are like siblings, and they stick knives in their ribs. He admits that there is some truth in this sentence, but this truth is not applied to his tiger, but to others.       Just when the mountain tiger was thinking like this in his heart, he had already plunged into the mountains and forests. The mountain tiger felt that he was a tiger returning to the mountain at this time, and no one could stand him anymore.       Suddenly, his ears moved, and he heard a faint cracking of the spring. Although the mountain tiger had never heard such a sound, the hairs on his body suddenly stood up, and a feeling of extreme danger instantly surged up, and his subconscious body rushed to the side.However, even though the Tiger reacted in a timely manner, although it dodged the vital part, it was still shot in the shoulder by a crossbow arrow. The intense pain made his body tremble, but the sense of crisis of the great powers made him bother to check the injuries. Continuing a twist, the body jumped to the other side.       It's a pity that Leng Feng's crossbow arrow was fired nearly 100 meters away from the mountain tiger. It just shot him in the shoulder and didn't hurt the vital point. Fortunately, the special repeater is very destructive, and after being shot at the target, it will make the target's wound bleed nonstop.       Just after the body of the mountain tiger flashed to a big tree, the big tree he was leaning on was shot by a crossbow arrow again. Fortunately, the tree was thick enough to hold the tiger's body, otherwise the arrow would have seriously injured him, if not killing him.       Burst!       "Who, who's secretly attacking me? Get out of here and have a fair fight with grandpa! ”
       Cold sweat flowed from the tiger's forehead, and there was a sharp pain from the wound from the crossbow arrow. What frightened him the most was the secret murderous machine, because he couldn't find out who was plotting against him.       What he did was a bloody trade on the head of a knife, what kind of danger he hadn't experienced!       But this is the first time he has seen this kind of powerful secret weapon. The Tiger has an intuition that this kind of secret weapon is a fatal threat to him, especially in this environment, and he may lose his life if he is not careful.       In fact, the strength of the Mountain Tiger is still good, and he is the most powerful person Leng Feng has encountered so far. But no matter how high the martial arts are, he is afraid of kitchen knives, not to mention that the repeater in Leng Feng's hand is not a kitchen knife, but a life-seeking Hades post.       Leng Feng didn't shoot again when he saw that the tiger hid behind a big tree, and he didn't expect the tiger to be so alert. He hid far behind along the way, just for fear of arousing the vigilance of the mountain tiger.       It's not that Leng Feng doesn't dare to confront him head-on, but that will inevitably cause a lot of movement. With the strength of the mountain tiger, Leng Feng is not sure of defeating him. If you don't take advantage of it, you are a bastard.       Without an absolute advantage, Leng Feng will not come out and fight hard with the tiger face to face.       Jungle sniping, that is a necessary skill for special forces. Therefore, in such an environment, Leng Feng once again found the feeling of being a special soldier in his previous life.       He stared at the big tree where the tiger was hiding, and slowly moved to one side. Since the mountain tiger wants to hide, let him hide.       At this time, the mountain tiger was finally able to check the wound on his shoulder, and the crossbow arrow had already shot through his shoulder, and the tip of Sen Ran's arrow was exposed. The tip of the arrow is in the shape of a cross spiral, and it looks unusually sharp. The shape of this arrow tip is destined to make it impossible for the person who is hit by the arrow to pull out the arrow easily, otherwise it will cause a lot of secondary damage.       The tail of the arrow is also cross-shaped, and it is quite troublesome to be shot by this kind of arrow, not only does it hurt more, but it is also difficult to remove.       Hold the tip of the arrow in one hand and aim the other hand at the exposed tip of the crossbow arrow. The Tiger wanted to cut off the arrow first, and then deal with it. But the next moment, his face twisted in pain.The mountain tiger had miscalculated, and the special crossbow bolts were not the same as the ones he had usually seen. The knife not only did not cut off the arrow, but also shed a cap of blood from the wound. He couldn't help but let out a muffled grunt, and then he noticed that the crossbow bolt that hit his body was not ordinary.       Cold Front's crossbow bolts are made of a special metal, which is not only extremely penetrating, but also exceptionally strong.       Just as the mountain tiger was studying the crossbow arrows, Leng Feng had already lurked on the other side of the big tree, and had narrowed the distance by another twenty or thirty meters.       Leng Feng raised his hand and aimed the crossbow bolt at the mountain tiger again.       Although the mountain tiger was highly guarded against the hunters lurking in the shadows, he did not expect that his opponent was a special forces king from another era. In the era when Leng Feng lived, although the force value was not good, for all kinds of tactical research, it was far beyond this era. Especially for the hunting skills of special forces, it is definitely not comparable to people of this era.       "Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!" Three faint bursts of the air sounded in a row, each with an interval of only a few tenths of a second.       When the tiger heard the sound, it was too late to react quickly. After all, although the speed of sound propagation is faster than the speed of crossbow arrows, at close range, the difference between the two sides is not too big. Moreover, the three crossbow arrows were going straight to the chest of the mountain tiger and the left and right sides of his body, no matter which way he dodged, he could not get rid of the attack of the crossbow arrows.       What's more, in the dark, with the eye of a mountain tiger, you can't see the flight path of the crossbow arrow clearly.       These three bolts have locked the tiger's retreat, in such a situation, unless the tiger has the ability to predict in advance, or he can see the direction of the three arrows. Unfortunately, neither of these abilities is available. He simply relied on his instinctive perception of danger and threw himself towards a large tree on the other side.       He reacted correctly and had good ideas. Dodged the first bolt to his chest, but the second bolt didn't.       As the tiger was in the process of dodging, his body was a little taller, and the crossbow arrow that was originally aimed at his chest was shot into his abdomen.       Although a shot in the abdomen will not kill you immediately, it can be regarded as a vital injury.       With a "plop", the mountain tiger fell to the ground, he covered his lower abdomen with his hands, and found that there was already a blood hole in his abdomen, faintly revealing the internal organs inside. The bolt pierced him directly in the abdomen, causing him massive damage.       The mountain tiger is also a ruthless person, knowing that he can't escape at this time, he directly gritted his teeth and tore off his shirt and tied his abdomen tightly. Then he held the long knife in his hand and put on a desperate look.       All this was seen by Leng Feng, and he also knew the purpose of the mountain tiger. In fact, he could have hid there and continued to ambush, but after thinking about it, Leng Feng still wanted to fold the special repeater and put it in the bushes where he was hiding.       The Tiger had been badly wounded, and no one knew better than him what it would do if he was shot by a special repeater. If it is not treated in a timely and effective manner, with the loss of blood, the mountain tiger will soon lose its life due to excessive blood loss.       According to his previous habits as a special soldier, he didn't have to pay attention to the mountain tiger at all, and when he died, it would be wisest to send him back to the west with a few more arrows. But after being reborn in this era, some of Leng Feng's thoughts changed, and he reached out and pulled out a dagger transformed from the Bayi Saber from his waist and walked out of his hiding place.The mountain tiger had a hideous look on his face, and he saw a black shadow appear more than ten feet away from him. Although there was still a period of time before dawn at this time, he couldn't see the face of that figure clearly, but he could feel the powerful battle intent emanating from the other party's body.       In the eyes of the Tiger, this person can lock himself silently, and judging from the different directions of the two arrows before and after, the opponent's combat ability in the jungle should be quite strong. He didn't know when he had offended such a person, and there didn't seem to be such a person among the people he knew.       Although the mountain tiger is a bandit, he is not a reckless man, and he knows that Leng Feng and Feng Xiangyang before him are not in the same group. Otherwise, with the kind of crossbow arrows in the opponent's hand, if he dealt with him when he fought with Feng Xiangyang and the others before, he would definitely hate him on the spot.       He knew the power of the crossbow arrows.       This is also where the mountain tiger feels puzzled, although he is ready to fight back to the death. But he didn't expect the other party to cooperate with him so much. If Leng Feng has been hiding in the dark and does not come out, he will not be able to see his opponent even if he is dead.       "Who the hell are you?"       "The one who wants your life!"       Leng Feng didn't say much to Guoshan Tiger, he wanted to find someone to test his combat effectiveness.       "It's good to come!" As soon as the mountain tiger saw Leng Feng rushing towards him, he immediately shouted and met it with a horizontal knife.       After all, the mountain tiger is a bandit, and he has a fierce energy in his bones. was attacked by Leng Feng twice in a row before, and he felt very aggrieved. Now seeing Leng Feng take the initiative to jump up and fight him hand-to-hand, the ferocity of the mountain tiger was completely stimulated, and he decided in his heart that he would gnaw on the other party's two mouthfuls of flesh before he died.       The knife of the mountain tiger condensed a lifetime's energy, and the long knife slashed towards Leng Feng as fast as lightning. However, when his sword fell, he realized that it had slashed into the air.       The strength of the Coaster is not weak, and if it is not injured, it is not under the cold front at all. But firstly, he was too seriously injured and his strength was discounted, and secondly, he miscalculated his opponent.       Leng Feng did rush straight towards him, but just as he swung his knife and fell, Leng Feng's body folded in half at an extremely strange angle. Originally, he was a normal human being, but when the long knife of the mountain tiger slashed, his upper body disappeared strangely.       This is the power of the Twelve Heavenly Gods and Demons Forging Divine Skill, which can not only make the physical body of a cultivator extremely strong, but also can make many unbelievable movements.       Leng Feng's upper body did not disappear strangely, but directly folded in half, but it did not affect his actions. His hands seemed to grow out of his crotch, and he held a saber and dagger through the belly of the mountain tiger. As a result, a larger blood hole appeared on the lower abdomen of the mountain tiger, and the intestines also flowed out.       The Tiger was indeed a ruthless man, he could feel the wound on his abdomen, but he didn't care about it at all, and slashed back with a backhand.       At this time, Leng Feng's body had already slipped behind Gu Shanhu. Seeing the opponent's long knife cut down, he didn't dodge, and the dagger in his hand drew an arc and blocked the opponent's long knife.       Daggers versus long knives seem unwise in the eyes of normal people, after all, this is tantamount to using their own shortcomings to carry the other party's strengths.However, the mountain tiger felt that his knife was being pulled by a strange force, and slashed to the other side.       Leng Feng's knife used the move in Tai Chi, and this lead not only unloaded part of the opponent's strength, but also changed the direction of the opponent's move. However, Leng Feng could also feel that the strength of the Mountain Tiger was not weak, so he didn't spare the slightest bit when he shot.       After unloading the opponent's knife, Leng Feng pounced on the other party, originally the two were very close to each other, but now Leng Feng almost collided with the other party.       Poof!       After a single sound, the two quickly separated.       The tiger dropped the long knife in his hand, covered his neck with both hands, and made a gurgling sound from his mouth. Just now, at the moment when the two sides made contact, the long knife of the mountain tiger had no time to return to defense, and his throat was cut open by the saber in Leng Feng's hand.       This fatal injury immediately made the mountain tiger lose the ability to resist. In fact, with the strength of the mountain tiger, it should not be able to hold three moves in Leng Feng's hands. It can only be said that he has lost his square inch at this time, and Leng Feng's playing style is extremely weird, coupled with the fact that he was seriously injured before, which led to the current result.       Leng Feng looked at the corpse of the tiger who had fallen to the ground, and there was no joy or sorrow in his eyes. In his previous life, when he was a special soldier, he had a lot of human lives on his hands, and in this era, human lives are even more worthless, not to mention that the other party is still a bandit who has done a lot of evil.       Leng Feng looked at the package under the big tree, reached out and picked it up, and found three crossbow arrows from the surroundings. As for the crossbow arrow on the shoulder of the mountain tiger, it has been damaged by the mountain tiger's long knife.       Although the crossbow arrow was no longer usable, Leng Feng still took it out, took it off and threw it into the grass in the distance.       After looking at the corpse of the mountain tiger, Leng Feng bent down and searched out a small cloth bag from his chest. The small cloth bag is not big, only the size of a palm, and it can be hidden by the mountain tiger, which shows that this thing is very important.       Leng Feng opened the cloth bag and found that it was a booklet, but it was not a martial arts cheat, but a fragmentary map. Many of these places are marked with red lines and red dots.       Leng Feng didn't know where the mountain tiger got the map, and the information in this era was not smooth, so it was not easy to get such a detailed map.       After taking a closer look, Leng Feng found that the maps on this booklet were all from the north and south of the river. Although he was unfamiliar with this era, the geographical location of this era was no different from the era in which he lived. You can still see what the places are, and most of these places are mainly mountains and forests.       After thinking about it carefully, Leng Feng understood that this was the robbery map of the mountain tiger and others. Although they are rogue bandits, they are also organized. Those places that have been marked have been robbed by them, and the red dots in the marks have special meanings.       Chances are, that's where they hide their valuables.       Because Leng Feng saw on the map that Lotus Town was also circled, but there was no red dot, Leng Feng speculated that this red dot should mark some special places. Thinking of the treasure that the Golf has collected this booklet, it is not only as simple as robbing the map, but also likely to be used as a place to record the treasure.After all, the tiger has been robbing all year round, and there must be a lot of wealth looted. There are still three caves in the cunning rabbit, not to mention the bandits such as the mountain tiger. Leng Feng already had a guess in his heart, but whether it was true or not still had to be verified. He didn't have the time now, and he would make plans after this trip to Jiankang Mansion was over.       Leng Feng searched for an inaccessible ravine not far away and threw the body of the mountain tiger down.       After doing all this, it didn't take long, Leng Feng returned with the package. In order not to attract attention, he did not bring the package back, but found a hidden place in the mountains and forests to bury the package.       When Leng Feng sneaked back to Lotus Town again, he found that the streets were full of beggars, and the people who had been harmed by bandits had already taken to the streets.       Many people brought out their own food to entertain these beggars, and those who had been plagued by bandits expressed their gratitude to these beggars. Although the beggars took half of the money, no one objected.       After Leng Feng touched it back, he found that he didn't have to hide, because all the people had come out. He walked down the street in such a way that no one noticed him.       "Young master, where did you go!" At this point, Chai Bo and Fluttershy run over in a panic.       After the beggars eliminated the bandits, they had already notified everyone that they could come out, but anyone who was robbed by the bandits could go to the beggars to get back half of their property. At first, no one believed it, but after a few bold people appeared, the others rushed out.       After all, being able to get half of the property back is a windfall.       Chai Bo and Fluttershy also come out at this time, but they get anxious when they find out that Leng Feng is not in the room. hurriedly ran out to look for it, but after looking for a long time, he didn't find any trace of Leng Feng. Just when the two of them were in a hurry, they suddenly found that Leng Feng was wandering around in the crowd.       "I heard that the bandits were beaten away, so I came out to take a look!" Leng Feng said.       "Young Master, you scared us to death!" Fluttershy says.       "Young master, it's no better outside than at home, so you still have to be careful." Chai Bo also said.       "Worries you! I heard that I was able to get half of the money back, so I came over to see if it was true! ”
       Leng Feng knew that the two of them were indeed worried about him, so he diverted the topic. Sure enough, when Leng Feng says this, Fluttershy and Chai Bo then realize that they also have their silver stolen by the bandits.       So Leng Feng and the three of them came to the crowd of beggars and reported the amount and characteristics of the silver they had been robbed. After checking with the beggars, half of them were recovered.       "Divide it in half!"       Leng Feng felt that the people of the beggar gang were really interesting, but everyone could accept this kind of operation.       After getting back half of his money, Leng Feng and Fluttershy go back to the inn. The corpses of the bandits in the inn had been disposed of, and the others had all received half of the money, and although they hadn't slept much all night, they were all preparing to leave here quickly.       So no one paid attention to the three of Leng Feng, and Leng Feng was only robbed of a dozen taels of silver by bandits before, in the eyes of these businessmen, Leng Feng and the three were poor ghosts.       "Young master, let's also prepare and leave at dawn." Chai Bo said."Good!"       Leng Feng also wanted to leave here, and now he finally saw the chaos of this era. Bandits are able to rob blatantly, and after such a long time, no one from the government has come to see what is going on. If it weren't for these beggar gang disciples, the bandits such as the mountain tigers would have been able to calmly retreat after the scourge here.       It seems that he will not be peaceful along the way.       It's hard to say whether the bandits can be encountered, he already knows that he is being targeted. The three people he killed before were obviously coming for him.       But fortunately, there was a robbery by bandits, so that the three people were grouped into the bandit side, and did not arouse any suspicion.       Even the people behind these three killers did not expect to encounter bandits and robbery.       Therefore, when the Huang Hall Master learned that his three subordinates had broken in Lotus Town, he smashed the case with an angry slap.       "Damn! Tigers, beggars! ”
       The Yellow Hall Master was very angry, but he couldn't help it, the bandits of the Mountain Tiger were wiped out by the beggar gang, and the beggar gang was not something he could afford to provoke. So even if he is angry, he has nowhere to go now.       The Mountain Tiger and the Huang Hall Master still have a little friendship, and the two have cooperated before, although they are not friends, but they also have business contacts. In his opinion, the Tigers will not attack their own people, only the people of the beggar gang may do it. However, he didn't dare to trouble the beggars, and he didn't take care of it, so he had to admit that he was a dumb loser.       "This can't be counted like this, we have to let Leng Er have some blood!"       Huang Tang Master is not a good stubble, in his opinion, this matter is caused by Second Master Leng , although the three people were sent by him to kidnap Leng Feng, but he also has to find Second Master Leng to ask for compensation. What's more, now that his person is dead, this is not a matter of no reward, so it is over, and Leng Erye must be allowed to have some blood.       Leng Feng didn't know that because he had killed those three killers, Hall Master Huang would go to his second uncle to extort money. Similarly, Second Master Leng didn't know about it.       Therefore, when the Huang Hall Master found him, he was very angry. Obviously planning to borrow a knife to kill someone, why should he still be paid, and he also has to compensate the three people under the Huang Tang Master for settling in.       This made Second Master Leng feel very angry, and felt that these people in the rivers and lakes were unreliable, but fortunately he had arranged his own manpower to intercept and kill Leng Feng.       After the Huang Hall Master got the money from Second Master Leng, Second Master Leng had already dissociated himself from Huang Hall Master in this matter. However, Huang Tang is more greedy, although he agreed, how could he just give up.       Although Leng Feng didn't know about this, he could also guess that the only people who would attack him were the second and third uncles. However, he didn't expect that Hall Master Huang would also deal with him. This is not to blame Leng Feng, with Leng Dashao's previous style, he naturally won't pay attention to these.       Moreover, the purpose of the Huang Hall Master to deal with him was not to kill him directly, but to see if he could find out the so-called person behind him from his body.       Hall Master Huang didn't wronged Leng Feng by doing this, this matter really had something to do with him, and this illusion that there was someone behind it was really created by himself.       However, Leng Feng doesn't pay much attention to the two uncles now, and he already has some means of self-preservation. As soon as he has the status of the top of this selection test, the two uncles can't make a fuss on the bright side. Second, his current force value is not weak, and a master like the Mountain Tiger is no longer a threat to him.Next, the focus should be on how to continue to improve its own strength and develop its power.       After today's encounter, Leng Feng found that his strength had reached the standard of breaking through the rivers and lakes in this era. Leng Feng's real combat power should be similar to that of the Mountain Tiger and the Three Bags Elder Feng Xiangyang of the Beggar Gang. However, if other means were used, Leng Feng could kill them in an instant.       Sometimes killing people is not just about who has the highest strength.       As for the four Zhou Buyi people he met before, Leng Feng felt that that person was not at the same level as the mountain tiger, and they could easily kill the mountain tiger.       Leng Feng's next target to catch up with is Zhou Buyi's level.       After packing his luggage, Leng Feng was also ready to leave Lotus Town. At this time, the sky had already brightened, and after the scourge of bandits, Lotus Town had become panicked. Although the bandits did not kill many people this time, the psychological impact on people was still great.       Fortunately, the bandits were eliminated in time, otherwise they might not even have breakfast today.       Fortunately, the loss of the inn was not large, and the shopkeeper and the guy were busy early in the morning. In addition to cooking for Leng Feng's guests, he also cooked a lot of food for those beggars to eat.       Just as Leng Feng was having breakfast, the little beggar who asked him to invite him to eat chicken yesterday came again. However, Leng Feng was keenly aware of the smell of blood on his body, but thinking of what happened at night, Leng Feng didn't care too much.       The battle between beggars and bandits prevailed, but it was not without losses. Whether the little beggar is a member of the beggar gang or not, it is normal for them to be involved in that environment. In Leng Feng's opinion, this little beggar was stained with the blood of bandits, and he was not killed by the bandits, which was a big fate.       But what he didn't know was that the bandits in the inn were killed by the little beggars. Where is this stained with the blood of the bandits, but directly bloodletting the bandits.       In fact, the smell of blood on the little beggar was not stained in the inn, it was after Leng Feng left, when the little beggar went to pursue the bandits second and third masters.       After the two of them lost their weapons, their speed was really much faster, and the six beggar elders behind them really couldn't catch up with them. Fortunately, the little beggar was fast enough, and after a pillar of incense, he had already surpassed six elders, and stopped the second and third masters of the bandits in front.       The phrase of poor Kou Mo chasing is still very reasonable, although the two bandits have lost their heavy weapons, they both have short knives on them. The little beggar also used a dagger, and the three of them met each other as soon as they met.       In order to escape for their lives, the two of them are very fierce, as long as they are not hurting the vital point, they completely ignore it.       Although the little beggar's skills are not bad, but under this kind of deadly fighting, he will not be able to win these two people for a while. And under their way of exchanging injuries for injuries, the little beggar was also slightly injured.       In this way, he fled while fighting, and after nearly half a pillar of incense, the three bags of elder Feng Xiangyang chased after him. With Feng Xiangyang joining, the two bandit leaders were suppressed.       It wasn't until all the beggar elders chased after them that the two of them saw that they were overwhelmed, and immediately threw away their weapons and surrendered. These two guys seem to be ruthless, but they are quick enough to admit intimidation. Compared to the mountain tigers, they are not real bandits.       Let the two guys be tied up, and the little beggar will return to Lotus Town. By the time the others returned, everything had settled on the Lotus Town side. If he came back a little later, Leng Feng and the others would have already finished eating and left."Good man, I'm hungry again!" When the little beggar saw Leng Feng, he spoke directly.       Hearing this, the corners of Leng Feng's mouth twitched, and this little beggar came up and sent him a good person card. It seems that no matter what era it is, the good guy card is not so easy to receive.       "You're not going to eat chicken again today, are you?" Leng Feng said.       He didn't think the little beggar was annoying, but he thought the other party was very interesting. Therefore, Leng Feng secretly showed to Chai Bo, meaning that he deliberately pretended not to see it.       "No, no, as long as you can eat your stomach!" The little beggar hurriedly waved his hand and said.       Leng Feng looked left and right and found that the inn was already full of beggars. In order to thank the beggars, the innkeeper took out all the food and invited them to eat.       "Look!" Leng Feng pointed around and said, "Today, the shopkeeper has a treat, you can let go of eating!" ”
       This is also what Leng Feng finds interesting, now the most popular thing in Lotus Town is beggars, and almost every family is entertaining beggars. Whether it is a beggar disciple or not, as long as he wears this beggar suit, there will be no starvation.       As a traffic artery, Lotus Town is not a big place, but it is quite rich. This is also the reason why the bandits of the Golfers are eyeing this place, a rich town, plus passing merchants, if you are lucky, you can definitely rob good things.       As a result, as the Tiger had hoped, they had indeed robbed the wealth here, but in the end they had lost their lives.       Leng Feng had already heard some news from the mouths of those beggars who were eating at this time, and the two bandit leaders who had escaped before had been captured by them. Now it's tying up the abandoned guard in Lotus Town, but it's a pity that the bandit boss has run away.       At this time, these beggars did not know that the mountain tiger did not flee in the direction they wanted at all, but went out from the other side. Of course, no one has found the carcass of the mountain tiger. After all, Leng Feng is from a special forces, and he will not leave a tail when dealing with this kind of thing.       The ravine where the body was dumped was about ten meters deep, steep around it, and it was rarely populated.       The little beggar scratched his head to hide his embarrassment, he was a little too deep into the play to notice the situation here. However, his face was covered with dust, and he couldn't tell whether he was embarrassed or not.       "Good man, thanks to your reminder, otherwise I would be hungry again!" The little beggar's brain teaser turned quickly, grabbed two steamed buns from the beggar table on the side, and turned around and sat down on Leng Feng's table.       However, this made everyone think that his head seemed to be a little unbright. Leng Feng didn't care, anyway, he was going to leave here after eating.       The little beggar was very comfortable this time, and did not ask for chicken or anything like that.       After a while, everyone finished eating, and the food in this era is not very particular, as long as you can eat enough. Leng Feng didn't have any interest in staying and watching, the mountain tigers were all killed by him, and the second and third masters didn't have any oil and water on them, so Leng Feng didn't care about what to do with them.       Cold Front, and Fluttershy ride in an old carriage along a bumpy road.The experience of Lotus Town was a great gain for Leng Feng, which not only tested his combat effectiveness, but also gained an extra fortune.       More importantly, he has a deeper understanding of the society of this era. Sure enough, it is a sign of the future of troubled times, disasters from the sky, bandits are rampant, and swords and soldiers everywhere are the standard in troubled times. In today's world, almost all of these are accounted for. Well, it's not far from a complete collapse.       The general trend of the world is nothing more than that it will be divided for a long time, and it will be divided for a long time. The end of the old era means the beginning of a new era. If you can't make a difference in this troubled world, then being a reborn person is equivalent to living to a dog.       At this point, Leng Feng's belief in his heart is even more resolute, and he must break new ground in this troubled world.       As soon as she got out of Lotus Town, the little girl had already recovered from the fright of the bandits. She saw that Leng Feng seemed to be thinking about something, and an inexplicable aura emanated from her body. This aura is something that Leng Dashao has never had before, and Fluttershy can't help but be attracted to her gaze.       After a while, she found that Leng Feng ignored her, and her eyes lingered around Leng Feng. When she saw the leather bag in Leng Feng's hand, her attention began to focus on this thing.       When she set off from Hongshan Villa before, she found that Leng Feng had been carrying this thing with her, and she thought it was a strange thing that Leng Dashao got from somewhere. After all, Leng Dashao didn't do much like this before.       Subconsciously, the little girl's hand reached out to the skin.       I don't know if Leng Feng felt the little girl's gaze and movements, or if he came back from his thoughts, looked at the little girl's hand that had been placed on the skin bag and smiled.       "Young Master, what is this? It's so heavy! Fluttershy is already holding it in her hand, and she feels that the weight of the bag is not light.       "Hehe, this is the young master's new toy!" Leng Feng said with a smile.       He's not worried about Fluttershy knowing the secrets of the Special Repeater, or about the danger she'll poss. Because the special repeater can be folded together after his transformation. When folded, it looks like a strange box, and only when it is opened and assembled will it have a deterrent effect.       After last night's actual combat test, Leng Feng found that the special repeater created in this era was no worse than that of his time. The power of this kind of repeater is very powerful, and it can allow a person who is not armed to kill some strong people in an instant.       Sensing Fluttershy's curious appearance, Leng Feng decides to find an opportunity to train the little girl so that she can also master the use of this repeater. After all, in troubled times, only strong force can protect itself.       Although the little girl doesn't have much strength, it is not the strength that controls the special repeater, but the feeling.       After the improved design of the cold front, it does not take much force to charge the upper arrow, as long as you hold down the handle and pull it down, you can complete a launch preparation. The true power of a crossbow is the feeling of aiming and shooting, which is the biggest factor in determining whether or not you can kill an enemy.       After all, no matter how powerful the bow and crossbow are, it's useless if you can't shoot the target. Fortunately, the crossbow bolt is not a firearm, and the recoil is negligible, making it a good practice for a novice like Fluttershy.       However, when the little girl heard Leng Feng say that this was his new toy, she obviously lost interest. After all, before this, the little girl had also seen Leng Feng's toys. Cold toys can definitely be considered quirky, but they are not practical at all.       The little girl is not a child now, so she naturally looks down on these things.       "Hehe, that's a good thing!"       Seeing Fluttershy's appearance, Leng Feng knew what she was thinking, and said with a smile as he reached out and pulled the special repeater out of his skin."What is this?" Fluttershy asks in surprise at this strange look.       After all, this thing doesn't look beautiful at all, it looks cold, and she doesn't understand when she will like this style of thing with the young master's character. Her curiosity is piqued, and in Fluttershy's mind, all she liked before was things that seemed interesting.       "Kakaka!"       With a few crisp sounds in a row, Leng Feng's hands were like magic, and a special repeater that exuded a deep killing intent took shape in his hand.       Looking at the strangely shaped bow and crossbow in Leng Feng's hand, Fluttershy's eyes widened and her mouth opened into an O-shape, "Master, this, this is your new toy!" ”
       "How? Master, this toy is okay! Leng Feng raised the repeater in his hand and said.       Leng Feng fiddled with the crossbow arrow in his hand, quickly wound it and pulled the trigger, and the crossbow made a series of crashing sounds. However, Leng Feng was just shooting crossbow arrows in the air, and the arrow clips had been taken off by him, and no arrows were shot out at all.       Even this stunned Fluttershy, and although the little girl didn't know anything about weapons, she also knew that the power of the crossbow should be not small. And from the young master's methods just now, it can be seen that this kind of crossbow arrow can also shoot quickly in bursts, she doesn't understand when the young master has this ability!       "How? Want to try it? Leng Feng said as he handed the bolt to Fluttershy.       The little girl stretched out her hand and carefully took the crossbow arrow. After the crossbow arrow was in hand, he only felt a sinking in his hand, and subconsciously held the handle hard, so that the crossbow arrow was held smoothly in his hand.       She followed Leng Feng's example, and found it easy to press the bowstring of the crossbow arrow. Then the trigger was pulled, and with a "buzz" sound, the bowstring of the crossbow made a slight trembling sound. Under normal circumstances, the sound of special repeaters is not so loud, mainly because there are no arrows on the bow and crossbow, and there will be this trembling sound when firing in the air.       Fluttershy's hand shakes slightly, and no one else feels uncomfortable.       "Young master, if you load a crossbow arrow, can you shoot far?" Fluttershy asks excitedly with her crossbow bolt on her face.       "It's not far!" Leng Feng said.       Hearing Leng Feng's words, the little girl had a slight look of disappointment on her face, she was full of expectations that this was a big baby. But after listening to the young master's words, it seems that this thing is really a toy.       "It's very far away!"       Leng Feng was actually deliberately teasing the little girl, and he wanted to laugh when he saw the little girl's appearance.       "Young master, you said yes, it's true!" Fluttershy doesn't care if Leng Feng is teasing her, and when she hears the second half of Leng Feng's words, her face shows hope again.       Just as Leng Feng is about to take out his crossbow arrows and show Fluttershy a demonstration, Chai Bo, who is setting up the carriage, suddenly stops the carriage.       "You little beggar, why did you still follow!" Chai Bo's voice came from outside.It turned out that this section of the road was not easy to walk, and Chai Bo did not sit in the carriage to catch the car, but came down and walked to lead the horse.       The roads of this era are like this, and in many places the road vehicles walk very slowly. This still belongs to Yangguan Avenue, and if it is a deserted place, vehicles will not be able to pass at all.       They hadn't gone far from Lotus Town when Chai Bo spotted the little beggar on the side of the road. This little beggar was the one who asked Leng Feng to invite him to eat chicken when he was in Lotus Town before, and for some reason, he actually ran in front of Leng Feng's carriage.       However, on such roads, it is not surprising that human legs can run faster than horse-drawn carriages. So, Chai Bo just thought that the little beggar followed them for a long-term meal ticket.       This is not to say how clever the little beggar's hiding ability is, but that Leng Feng and the three of them didn't think about other aspects at all.       Hearing Chai Bo's voice, Leng Feng also put away the crossbow arrow and quickly folded it. This magic-like trick makes Fluttershy's eyes shine. Cold Front smiles at Fluttershy and tosses her bolts.       "You play slowly!"       As soon as Leng Feng got out of the carriage, he saw the little beggar squatting on the side of the road, still the familiar formula, his face was dusty, and his clothes were like nets.       However, although the little beggar looked dirty, he did not have the strange smell of a beggar.       From this point of view, this little beggar is still a sophisticated beggar. This is also the reason why Leng Feng doesn't dislike him, after all, no one likes to stay with a person who is covered in dirt and has a strange smell.       "Good man, I didn't expect to meet you here!" The little beggar immediately smiled when he saw Leng Feng get out of the car. This mouth, showing two rows of white teeth, looks really happy.       "Young master, ignore him, be careful of being entangled by him!" Chai Bo looked at the little beggar with a vigilant face, grabbed Leng Feng and whispered.       In Chai Bo's opinion, it is better not to provoke such little beggars, because they are really pestering. Leng Feng is going to Jiankang Mansion to propose marriage, once this little beggar is entangled, not to mention the delay, the impact will not be good.       "Don't worry, I know it!" Leng Feng smiled at Chai Bo and said in the same low voice.       When Chai Bo saw Leng Feng like this, he had no choice but to remind: "Don't give him anything anymore!" ”
       In Chai Bo's opinion, the reason why the little beggar followed them was to get some food from them. If they don't give the little beggar something, then they will naturally leave after being disappointed.       "Say it! Why are you following us? Leng Feng took a few steps forward and came to the little beggar and asked.       At this time, Leng Feng had already realized that this was definitely not a chance encounter, and this little beggar was clearly following them.       Leng Feng was really careless before, he didn't notice the difference between this little beggar, he just thought he was very interesting. But now that I think about it, I don't think it's normal.       Think about it, if a beggar doesn't have a little smell on his body, can he still be called a beggar?The little beggar's face is very dirty, and the clothes on his body are very torn, but this kind of dirt and tattered looks so fresh and refined, which is very unscientific. Then there is only one explanation, that is, there is an element of deliberate such an element in his behavior and dress.       So why does he keep following him?       Leng Feng won't believe that this is a chance encounter, how can there be so many coincidences in the world.       The little beggar saw Leng Feng's expression, his eyes purred, and he said pitifully: "Follow the good people to have meat to eat!" ”
       The little beggar didn't say anything like those coincidences, after all, this kind of words sounded too much water, and it was easier for people to accept honestly telling their purposes.       Follow yourself to have meat to eat!       These words made Leng Feng's heart wonder if this little beggar was the same as him, and he also crossed over from that era.       This reminded him of a movie he had watched a long time ago called Wuji, in which there was a classic dialogue, the Snowpiercer who could turn back time by running, once said this when he decided to become a slave of the Great General.       "Tell me what you're going to do? It's okay to eat meat, but you have to prove that you can eat meat! Leng Feng said.       He now feels that this little beggar is not simple, Leng Dashao is not a person who has never seen the world, he invited a beggar to visit the Qinglou back then. And back then, he also used a chicken leg to exchange a martial arts cheats from an old beggar. It can be said that Leng Dashao and the beggar are still very fateful.       Although the little beggar was well hidden, Leng Feng could also feel a very vague aura on him. This breath is not simple, even if you can't suppress it. But fortunately, he didn't feel a trace of malice from the little beggar.       This is also the reason why Leng Feng talked to him so much, firstly, he felt that this little beggar was indeed very interesting, and secondly, he did not feel unfavorable to him from the little beggar.       Whether it was the powerful divine soul perception ability formed after crossing over, or the exercises he cultivated, his senses were different from ordinary people. Whether a person is hostile to himself or not, he can't hide it from Leng Feng at all. Although his strength is not the strongest, Leng Feng is confident that even if he is a person who can kill him in one move, as long as he is hostile to him, he will not be able to escape his perception.       So, is this little beggar that strong? For Leng Feng, there is no need to verify it at all. If you are really that strong, you don't need to act with him, you can easily crush him.       The little beggar didn't expect that Leng Feng would think so much just in an instant. Although he is not simple, he is still a little more tender mentally than Leng Feng.       "I eat, sleep, and tease!" The little beggar said very seriously.       As soon as these words came out, Leng Feng felt that this little beggar had crossed over from his world. What this guy said was more like a time-traveler than him.       Eat, sleep, tease! Isn't this Nina a stalk from a previous life!       Seeing that Leng Feng's eyes flashed with an inexplicable light, the little beggar somehow suddenly felt that Leng Feng's body exuded a palpitating aura. Originally, he didn't regard Leng Feng as a powerful character, and the reason why he followed Leng Feng was because Leng Feng was the first person to invite him to dinner, although he didn't lack that meal.       This time, he took the lead in exterminating the mountain tigers. The Tiger is erratic, and it is difficult to catch him. In order to wait for the mountain tiger, he has been guarding the lotus town for more than ten days. Although he wiped out all the Tiger's men, he didn't capture the leader of the Tiger, and it couldn't be said that the operation was a success.Although the little beggar is the leader of the beggar gang, no one dares to say that he can't do this, and even praises him for doing a good job. However, in the eyes of the little beggar, the mountain tiger is the real big fish. Now the big fish are not hit, and it is very boring to catch a net of small fish and shrimp.       And at this time, he found an interesting person, and he could feel the difference between Leng Feng and the others. In Leng Feng's eyes, beggars seem to be no different from normal people, there is no contempt or pity, but a real equality.       In Leng Feng's eyes, this little beggar is very interesting, and in the eyes of the little beggar, Leng Feng is also very interesting. So, two interesting people meet again.       "Tease!" The little beggar suddenly screamed.       "Squeak!" A scream rang out, and a small monkey emerged from the bushes on the side of the road. The little beggar pulled out a small whip from his waist, and with a wave of his hand, the whip sounded a crisp sound in the air.       As soon as the little monkey saw the whip sound, he immediately flipped his head in the air. As the whip in the little beggar's hand continued to explode, the little monkey also made a lot of movements.       "This, is this a monkey trick!" Fluttershy gets out of the carriage as well.       "Monkey, sort of!" Leng Feng didn't know what it was.       "Smack!"       With a crisp pop, the little beggar's whip slashed in a beautiful arc in the air, and he reinserted it into his waist. The little monkey also followed the sound, and a nimble somersault landed on the little beggar's shoulder.       "This is teasing?" Leng Feng saw that the little beggar had finished his work, and immediately asked.       "His name is Tease, a very smart monkey. I play different whets and he can do a lot of things. The little beggar reached out and stroked the smooth fur of the little monkey.       The corners of Leng Feng's mouth twitched, and the worry in his heart also settled, it seemed that he was thinking too much, how could there be such a traversal person in this world.       "It's so cute, can I touch him?" Fluttershy doesn't think much of it, but looks at the little monkey on the beggar's shoulder, and her eyes light up.       Looking at Fluttershy's excited face, Leng Feng can now understand those who had pets in his previous life. This little monkey is indeed very cute and cute, and his size is much smaller than that of ordinary monkeys, and he looks about the size of a domestic cat. The fur on the whole body is golden yellow, and there is not a single stray hair.       Leng Feng also saw that this little monkey might be a variant of the golden snub-nosed monkey. Trained by the little beggar, he grimacs at Fluttershy when he looks at him with a blank eye. This doesn't scare Fluttershy, but it makes the girl giggle.       "That's good, Chai Bo takes him with him, and there is a helper on the way!" Leng Feng said.       In fact, he also wanted to see what the origin of this beggar was, as long as he was not sent by his two uncles to deal with him. Under the influence of the four of Zhou Buyi before, Leng Feng regarded this trip to Jiankang Mansion as an experience, and it was not a bad thing for him to be able to meet some people on the way.So, on the next road, Leng Feng's team had one more person and a monkey.       If it weren't for the wrong occasion, Leng Feng would have felt that he was about to catch up with the story of Tang Seng and his apprentice learning scriptures from the West. However, Leng Feng found that in the history of this era, there was no story about Tang monks and apprentices learning scriptures from the West.       I don't know if Lao Wu hasn't written a novel yet, or if there is no Wu Chengen in this era.       In this era, rushing is a very boring thing, and having a little beggar and a little monkey adds a little fun along the way. Fluttershy, like Cold Front, doesn't dislike the little beggar, but becomes good friends with him. Similarly, Fluttershy gets her wish to touch the little monkey, and the little monkey gets acquainted with Fluttershy and often jumps on her shoulder.       As for the cold front, the little monkey has been in a free state.       Hurrying during the day and resting at night, Leng Feng did not give up practicing the two divine skills. However, due to Leng Feng's special cultivation skills, as long as Leng Feng is unwilling, others will not be able to discover the secret of his cultivation.       However, with the addition of the little beggar, Leng Feng did not take out the repeater again. It seems that teaching Fluttershy to control the bolts will have to be put off for a while, as Leng Feng doesn't want anyone else to know about the bolts.       Since the little beggar joined their team, there have been no incidents of bandits and robberies similar to those in Lotus Town along the way, but it is not too calm, and Leng Feng has attracted another wave of assassinations by killers. But this time he didn't make a move, but the little beggar quietly dealt with the person in secret.       The little beggar thought that what he was doing was very secretive, but he didn't know that his every move had been secretly watched by Leng Feng.       Witnessing the whole process of the little beggar's move, Leng Feng had already thought that when he was in Lotus Town before, the bandits on the second floor of the inn were dealt with by the little beggar. Because the way the little beggar dealt with these killers was the same as the way the bandits died when their throats were cut.       The reason why the little beggar was able to spot several killers before Leng Feng was not because his perception was higher than Leng Feng's, but because of the credit of his little monkey called teasing. Tease not only does it turn its heels, but it also has other skills.       Most of the time, the little monkeys run out to play on their own. But no matter how Leng Feng and they rushed, the little monkey would always come out of nowhere to catch up with them. And this little monkey is very human, it seems to be playing, but all the changes around him can't hide his perception.       Those killers were very cautious, at least much more careful than the three under Huang Tang in Lotus Town last time.       The day after Leng Feng and the others left Lotus Town, these killers had already followed. However, they all followed from a distance at first, and when Leng Feng and them were far away from Lotus Town, they slowly followed.       At first, no one noticed that there were killers following, because these killers only followed from a distance for miles, and did not reveal any strong murderous intent.       And because of the distance, with Leng Feng's powerful perception ability, he didn't find anything wrong. If it weren't for the discovery of the little beggar's anomaly, he wouldn't have known that he had been targeted.       These killers were also unlucky, even when they were dying, they didn't figure out how they were exposed. Unexpectedly, it was only a small monkey that had exposed their whereabouts, and they had seen this little monkey before, and even one of them suggested that this monkey be caught and roasted monkey brains to eat.       These killers were arranged by Leng Feng's second uncle to deal with Leng Feng, but he didn't expect to be solved by the little beggar without Leng Feng making a move at all.The little beggar thought that Leng Feng was just an ordinary scholar, so he stepped in to help him resolve the danger. But he didn't know that all his actions had been seen through by Leng Feng.       Of course, it is precisely because of this that Leng Feng has completely lost his vigilance against the little beggar.       Leng Feng knew that with his current situation, except for the second and third uncles, who had murderous intentions against him, others would not take him seriously at all. The little beggar approached him, and as long as it was not related to the two uncles, he would not want to harm him.       Then there is only one explanation, and the aura of his protagonist plays a role! Or rather, it was just a chance encounter.       This is how people communicate, perhaps because of a one-eye meeting in the crowd, or because of a meal like Leng Feng.       Since the little beggar helped Leng Feng solve the killer, the remaining few days were very peaceful. Three days later, an old carriage appeared outside the city gate of Jiankang Mansion.       It was a strange combination, driven by an old man and a little beggar with a small monkey with golden hair squatting on his shoulder. The little beggar was still dusty and his clothes shabby, but his eyes were very energetic.       In fact, along the way, Leng Feng did not let the little beggar wash his face. However, the little beggar said that this was a sign of a beggar and could not be washed off.       According to the little beggar, he was a beggar family, and the dust on his face was made of special herbs to repel mosquitoes and wild beasts. It's a drug, it's not really dust, and it nourishes the skin when applied over a long period of time.       In short, this is not something that can be washed away easily.       When Leng Feng heard him say this, he didn't mention it again. After all, this thing is applied to the face, but it only covers the face of the face, but there is no peculiar smell. And Leng Feng also observed carefully, and it was really like what the little beggar said, there were really no mosquitoes around the little beggar on this road.       Leng Feng thinks this is a good thing, although it is not good-looking, but it is very practical. In this era, there are not as many chemical anthelmintics as there are in later generations, even chemical anthelmintic drugs, and they do not have this effect.       Leng Feng was a special soldier in his previous life, and he knew the effect of this herb very well. With this stuff, it will definitely be of great help to the military.       However, this is the little beggar's secret, if he doesn't take the initiative to say it, Leng Feng won't ask now. After all, Leng Feng is not the kind of person who will do anything to achieve his goals, although he can sometimes be ruthless, but he also has his own bottom line.       The little beggar didn't think about harming him, and he helped him more than once, Leng Feng naturally wouldn't be that kind of ruthless and unrighteous person.       Of course, if it really comes to the time when this thing is urgently needed, Leng Feng will not pretend to be high.       After paying the entrance fee, Leng Feng and the others entered Jiankang Mansion. The scale of Jiankang Mansion is many times larger than that of Linjiang City, and the two are not at the same level at all. It was Leng Feng who came from the twenty-first century, and he was also shocked by the walls of Jiankang Mansion.       The tall city walls were more than ten meters high, and the roads in the city were wide enough to accommodate four or five carriages in parallel. Of course, this kind of road can't be compared with the road at the time of Leng Feng, but in this era, it is already very imposing.Just when Leng Feng and the others were looking around in the city of Jiankang Mansion, some things were happening about him in the mansion of Second Master Leng in Linjiang City and the mansion of the supreme governor of Jiankang Mansion.       Leng Erye's face was pale, and the face of Leng Sanye opposite was also not good-looking. The two of them sat opposite each other and hadn't spoken for a long time. Next to the two of them, there was a man who stood with his eyebrows down for a long time, his forehead already oozing with sweat.       "I have raised you for ten years, and your whole family is counting on you to live. Now when you need to be used, it is so useless at the critical moment! Second Master Leng said with a gloomy face.       "You say, what's the use of me raising you!" Second Master Leng added another sentence ruthlessly.       Cold sweat was dripping on the man's forehead, but he didn't dare to wipe it with his hands, he knew how ruthless Second Master Leng was. They are all thugs secretly raised by Second Master Leng , and people like them specialize in shady work. In order to control them, the life and death of these people's families are in the hands of Leng Erye, as long as these people dare to betray or dissatisfy Leng Erye, the first to suffer is their family.       "It was our mistake, I didn't expect that little beggar next to Leng Feng to be a master."       "Mistakes, do you know how much this one mistake cost me? lost such a good opportunity, and also lost several brothers. Don't say that I didn't give you a chance, no matter what method you use, if my good nephew can return to Linjiang City safe and sound, then there is no need for you to exist! ”
       "Yes, please rest assured, this time I will personally attack with the poisonous wolf!"       It seems that the killers who were killed by the little beggar before were not the strongest people under Second Master Leng. The reason why Leng Er Ye was so angry was not because he lost a few thugs, but because he thought that he had missed the best opportunity to solve Leng Feng.       Second Master Leng is an old fox, and he understands the truth of long nights and dreams. And he had a bad feeling, Leng Feng was now getting more and more impenetrable to him, and there was a sign of getting out of his control.       "Have you found out what Leng Feng was doing in Jiankang Mansion?" Second Master Leng asked.       Regarding the relationship between Leng Da Rich and Huang Mingli back then, very few people knew about it, even Leng Second Master and Leng Third Master didn't know about it. After all, not long after the rich man made his fortune, the two of them were just helping in the store.       Moreover, Huang Mingli was a down-and-out scholar back then, and his encounter with the rich man Leng was also on the road outside. That is, Chai Bo and Leng Li knew about the relationship between the two, and the others did not know.       "I don't know yet, but based on his whereabouts, it can be inferred that the destination of Leng Feng's trip is Jiankang Mansion."       Not all the people sent out by Second Master Leng were killers, and a few of them were just responsible for tracking Leng Feng, because Second Master Leng also wanted to know what Leng Feng was doing when he went out this time.       "Second brother, didn't Leng Feng get the top spot before! Presumably, this time I went to Jiankang Mansion to pave the way into Beijing, and I want to make a difference through the relationship between the adults of Xuedao! Leng Sanye said.       Second Master Leng pondered for a moment when he heard this, and said: "The third brother's words are not unreasonable, my sister-in-law is also extraordinary, so she naturally understands the key to this, and this is the only way they can turn over." Leng Feng went to Jiankang Mansion this time, and there is only this possibility! ”
Second Master Leng's analysis is very reasonable, but it is a pity that he doesn't know the relationship between Leng Da Rich and Huang Mingli, and the more he thinks about it, the bigger the difference.       "But can my sister-in-law come up with anything good! Those masters of Jiankang Mansion are not comparable to Linjiang City, and ordinary things can't get into their eyes. And this time there are a lot of people who face the saint, although Leng Feng has become the top of Linjiang City, but Linjiang City is nothing in the entire Jiankang Dao. ”
       Although Leng Sanye's brain is not as good as Leng Erye's, he is not a good person, and he is also a calculating person.       "It's hard to say, I heard that Leng Feng's article has been submitted by Master Xuedao, if it is really favored by some big people, we are really passive. At that time, even if Leng Feng can't come up with a tael of silver, someone will win him over. ”
       Second Master Leng still sees the problem more deeply than Third Master Leng and knows that Leng Feng's advantage is not as simple as it seems on the surface.       "I'm curious, wasn't that kid Leng Feng a waste before, how could he write such a splendid article!"       Leng Sanye expressed the doubts that had plagued him for a long time, and he had thought about this question for many days, but unfortunately he had not come up with a reason.       "That's what I'm curious about! But now is not the time to dwell on this, we can't control things that have become a foregone conclusion, but we can nip in the bud things that have not become a foregone conclusion. ”
       Although Second Master Leng was also very curious about Leng Feng's changes, he was a person who would do whatever it took to achieve his goals, and everything else seemed trivial to him. Of course, the bigger reason is that he doesn't think Leng Feng has such a great talent, and there may be another reason behind it this time.       However, no matter what the reason is, it can't change his plan to control the Leng family's industry in his own hands.       Only after experiencing it can people understand the preciousness of it. Over the years, Second Master Leng has enjoyed the pleasure of having wealth, and let him go back to the old days, although he has no worries about food and clothing, he no longer has the ability to control huge amounts of property and control the fate of others.       This situation, in the opinion of Second Master Leng, must not occur.       "This time, no matter what, we can't let Leng Feng come back alive. In addition to killing the dark, you also need to use your brains more, and sometimes you don't have to use force to solve things. Second Master Leng said to the man.       The reason why Second Master Leng was dissatisfied was that he felt that the deaths of those people were too worthless. The reason why this thing failed was that those people were too careless and didn't use their brains seriously.       The bandits who robbed Lotus Town were all wiped out by the beggar gang, and through the news found afterwards, although they did not find out which masters the beggar gang dispatched this time, they knew the strength of the mountain tiger. The mountain tiger is very famous in this area, and the government has sent troops to chase him down many times, but they have not succeeded.       was able to destroy the bandits of the mountain tigers, so it can be seen that there should be many masters among the people who came out of the beggar gang this time.       Although Second Master Leng didn't know how Leng Feng got involved with the beggars, for those who only valued the results, he thought that the people he sent out were too rigid. Knowing that there are beggars by Leng Feng's side, and still thinking about intercepting and killing them, there are obviously many means available, why not use the stupidest way to solve the problem!       After sending away his subordinates, Leng Second Master and Leng Third Master also left the house, and the two of them came to a remote courtyard in Linjiang City.This is the base camp of the Huang Hall Master, although the Second Master Leng knows that cooperating with the Huang Hall Master is tantamount to seeking the skin of the tiger, but in order to solve Leng Feng, they are also willing to pay the corresponding price.       An hour later, Second Master Leng and Third Master Leng left the base camp of the Yellow Hall Master.       In the city of Jiankang Mansion, Leng Feng and the four of them found an inn and put the carriage and luggage in the inn. Chai Bo packed a few gifts in a wooden box and walked towards the yamen of Jiankang Mansion with Leng Feng.       In addition to the gifts, there was also a wedding letter, which was packed by Leng Feng in a delicate small wooden box. Although he didn't look at the importance of this marriage contract, he still had to do the superficial article.       With Leng Feng's battle, it is a bit shabby to say, after all, Huang Mingli is a dignified third-grade official. The prefect of Jiankang Mansion was also an important member of the Southern Song Dynasty. Under normal circumstances, the general prefect is also a Congsipin, but the Jiankang Mansion is different, it is the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty.       Moreover, in terms of the pattern of today's Southern Song Dynasty court, the appointment and dismissal of officials is relatively chaotic, and the prefect of Sanpin is not just a Jiankang Mansion.       If it is a normal visit, these gifts can also be said to be in the past, but if it is the first time to come to the door, it will be a little shabby.       However, Leng Feng's expectations are not too high, he is not a person of this era, and he does not value this kind of marriage contract. In his time, not to mention a marriage contract, it was common to get married and divorced.       Today Leng Feng is going to meet the legendary doll kiss, even if he is a human being in two lives, Leng Feng has never experienced this kind of thing. It would be a lie to say that there is no expectation in the heart.       In the previous life, many novels have described this kind of bridge, and most of the protagonists are looked down upon by the other party because of their low status. Then the protagonist rises strongly, counterattacks all the way, and finally slaps his face. Although this kind of cool text is very enjoyable to watch, Leng Feng doesn't want this kind of bridge to happen to him.       After all, acne grows on other people's faces, and it is innocuous to themselves. Once things happen to you, no one finds it easy to accept.       Leng Feng is not a saint, so naturally he can't handle it calmly.       However, what Leng Feng didn't know was that someone had visited Huang Mingli before he entered Jiankang Mansion. This person is Huang Mingli's colleague, who was originally an idle post of a doctor in the imperial court, and is considered an official of the fourth grade.       Now he has been sent to Jiankang Mansion to associate Huang Mingli in charge of government affairs, and has just been in office for less than a month. Although Huang Mingli is slightly higher in terms of official position, this person's backstage is harder, and he is Yang Chenggong, the younger brother of Yang Hongtai, a scholar in the cabinet of the Southern Song Dynasty.       And the reason why Huang Mingli was able to achieve the position of the prefect of Jiankang Mansion was that the big man behind it was the official secretary, and the official secretary and the cabinet scholar Yang Hongtai were of the same faction. Moreover, this time, Yang Chenggong became the counselor of Jiankang Mansion, which was to replace Huang Mingli soon after.       Huang Mingli will be transferred to the imperial court this time, and he will become a member of the imperial court of Zheng Sanpin. From the third grade to the third grade, although it seems that there is only a word difference, this threshold is difficult to cross, and many officials cannot take this step in their lifetime.       It can be seen that Huang Mingli is still operating very well above the officialdom!Yang Chenggong took over Huang Mingli's position, and everyone has already tacitly understood this, as long as the saint completes the talent selection, Huang Mingli can enter Beijing to work.       Yang Chenggong has a son named Yang Kang, who is exactly 18 years old this year, and came to Jiankang Mansion with his father Yang Chenggong. When he first saw Huang Mingli's daughter Huang Shishi, he was attracted by her peerless appearance and unique temperament, and he had urged his father Yang Chenggong to come to the door many times to ask for marriage.       Just now, their father and son left the Yellow Mansion.       Today, Yang Chenggong's father and son have prepared a formal greeting post, prepared enough etiquette, and went to Huangfu to express the meaning of proposing
       Although Huang Mingli knew that his daughter had a marriage contract before, over the years, this matter had gradually been forgotten by him. Especially in recent years, after the disappearance of the rich man Leng, the two families of Huang Leng have completely broken off contact.       Of course, the reason why Huang Mingli broke off his relationship with the Leng family was not only the disappearance of the rich man Leng Da, but also related to the things that Leng Dashao had done.       After all, as the supreme governor of Jiankang Mansion, it is still easy to investigate the news of a person. What Leng Dashao has done since he was a child has been thoroughly investigated by Huang Mingli, how could he let his daughter marry such a waste who does not learn and has no skills.       When the rich man Leng and Huang Mingli made a marriage contract, although Huang Mingli was a man, he fled from the lost territory in the north. Except for one person, there was no official position, and there were not a few people like Huang Mingli at that time, and even many officials fled to the south.       At that time, the rich man Leng already had a lot of financial resources, Huang Mingli came to thank the rich man Leng for saving and helping, and on the other hand, he also took a fancy to the financial resources of the rich man Leng. Later, with the financial support of the rich man Leng, he slowly got into the relationship with the imperial court, and the official became bigger and bigger.       However, not many people know about the relationship between Huang Mingli and the rich man Leng, because Huang Mingli only lived in Linjiang City for a period of time. During that time, Linjiang City was very chaotic, and there were many people who fled from the north, and the rich man Leng helped a lot of people during that time, and he didn't notice Huang Mingli.       Moreover, Huang Mingli was very low-key in Linjiang City at that time, did not associate with anyone, and left Linjiang City after the situation stabilized a little. Therefore, no one in Linjiang City knows the relationship between the Leng family and Huang Mingli, of course, this is also the result of the Leng rich man deliberately keeping a low profile.       Later, after Huang Mingli became an official, some of the interactions between the two were also private.       The rich man Leng is also a legend in Linjiang City, and no one can tell when he made his fortune, as if he had been out for a while when he was young. Later, after returning to Linjiang City, he rose all the way, and his business became bigger and bigger.       There are also rumors in the outside world that the industry of the rich man is not limited to Linjiang City, but also has industries in other places. Only the rich man Leng knows about those industries, and even the second and third masters of Leng don't know how many industries the rich man Leng has.       However, with the disappearance of the rich man Leng, these have become a mystery.       In fact, Second Master Leng and Third Master Leng also investigated the matter, but they were unable to find valuable clues. And they forced Leng Feng's family for this reason, I want to see the reaction of Leng Li and others.       However, judging from Leng Li's performance over the years, they can be sure that Leng Li does not know about Leng Li's industrial situation.       The relationship between the rich man Leng and Huang Mingli is very secret, especially after the disappearance of the rich man Leng, the relationship between the two families has been broken
So when Yang Chenggong came to propose marriage with his son, Huang Mingli did not refuse, but allowed him to think about it again on the grounds that the little girl was still young. However, he also reassured Yang Chenggong's father and son, saying that after he was transferred to the capital, Yang Chenggong could officially come to the door to propose.       I have to say that after all these years of officialdom training, Huang Mingli is no longer the down-and-out scholar he was back then. He has mastered the routines in officialdom and knows how to use all conditions to increase his bargaining chips.       Yang Chenggong is also a veteran of officialdom, so he can naturally hear the meaning of Huang Mingli's words. Huang Mingli wanted to use the relationship behind him to make his entry into Beijing more smooth.       Everyone understands people, and this matter is naturally easy to discuss, and finally the Yang father and son left the Huang Mansion with a smile on their faces.       Almost as soon as the Yang father and son left, Leng Feng came to the door of the Huang Mansion. Huang Mingli, as the supreme governor of Jiankang Mansion, his mansions are all official residences, which are actually the backyard of the yamen.       Although this mansion is not Huang Mingli's private property, and it will be handed over to the next prefect after leaving office, it is a symbol of status after all. In the entire Jiankang Mansion, no matter how rich others are, they can't surpass here in terms of building scale.       This is the characteristic of the times, and the hierarchy of Shinong industry and commerce is not just a joke.       Prime Minister's Slave Seven Rank Officials, although this is a bit exaggerated, the meaning is obvious. If you want to see these dignitaries, you must get these porters.       However, money can make ghosts grind, which is a golden rule in any era, and Leng Feng naturally understands these truths. Even though he didn't have much gold or silver in his hand, he still generously took out ten taels of silver and handed it to the porter.       Therefore, he didn't suffer any trouble, the evil slave and deception in the story did not appear, and the porter was very enthusiastic and handed Leng Feng's greeting sticker in.       When Huang Mingli saw the worship sticker, his face showed surprise, and then he smiled to himself and said: "Sure enough, it is not a coincidence that the book is not written, the front foot of the Yang family and the son have just left, and the Leng family child has come to the door on the back foot!" ”
       "Master, those two are waiting outside the door, if you don't see them, I'll drive them away!" As soon as the porter saw Huang Mingli's expression, he knew that Leng Feng and the others had little weight in Huang Mingli's eyes.       The concierge of the prefect's house is not something that ordinary people can do, at least this bit of eyesight is still necessary.       "No, you call him in!" Huang Mingli said.       When the porter heard this, he hurriedly retreated. This concierge is also a human spirit, Huang Mingli said that he called Leng Feng in, not please, which shows that his previous judgment was right, and the weight of those two people in the prefect's master is really not heavy.       If it weren't for Leng Feng's generous move, the porter would definitely have to make it difficult for Leng Feng.       "Two, please come with me, our master told you to go in!"       After saying hello, the porter led Leng Feng into the courtyard of the Huang family's mansion. As for Chai Bo, since Huang Mingli did not confess, he naturally couldn't come in. The gift brought by Leng Feng was also carried by the porter and walked in together.Huang Mingli's mansion is an official residence, compared with some private gardens, there are not so many delicate features in the architecture, but the layout is more grandiose.       In the main hall of the Huang family's mansion, Leng Feng met Huang Mingli.       The reason why Huang Mingli met Leng Feng here was not because he valued Leng Feng so much, but because the Yang father and son had only left for a short time, and Huang Mingli was too lazy to change places. The reason why he wanted to meet Leng Feng was because Leng Feng was the son of an old man, and the more important reason was that he wanted to take this opportunity to completely end the family business back then.       After all, in Huang Mingli's view, the Leng family is not right with the Huang family now. If Leng Feng's father is still there, with Leng Da's rich man's ability and financial resources, he Huang Mingli will also consider this family matter carefully. However, now the Leng family and the Yang family are compared, just like fireflies and Haoyue, there is no comparison at all.       And in Huang Mingli's opinion, if he admits this family business, then he will inevitably offend the Yang family. Although his transfer to the capital will not change because he offends Yang Chenggong's father and son, but with the forces behind Yang Chenggong, once he has a bad relationship with him, then even if he is transferred to Kyoto, the road to officialdom will not be so easy.       This is the reality, and the so-called promise and contract are nothing at all.       Of course, Huang Mingli, as an important member of the imperial court, still cares a lot about his reputation. The reason why he wanted to meet Leng Feng was to deal with this matter thoroughly and leave no handle. The best way is to be able to make the Leng family recognize the reality and willingly dissolve the marriage.       With Huang Mingli's status, it is very easy to investigate the current situation of the Leng family.       The reason why he didn't help the Leng family solve the problem of property competition over the years was also here. He wanted to use this as a condition to let the Leng family take the initiative to give up the marriage contract of the year. If Huang Mingli really wanted to help the Leng family, with his current ability, it would not be difficult for the Leng Feng family to get back their own property.       Therefore, people will change, don't think about looking at the present with the eyes of the past. What the years have changed is not only the face, but also the heart that I can't figure out when I see it.       And since ancient times, people have liked the icing on the cake, and there are very few that can really give charcoal in the snow.       For this point, Leng Feng saw it very clearly, and when he walked into the Huangfu compound, he had already understood Huang Mingli's thoughts. After all, the porter only said that the lord told them to go in, not that he invited them in. Although it's only a word difference, the doorway here is very big.       The porter could hear the meaning of Huang Mingli's words, and Leng Feng could also hear the meaning of Huang Mingli from the porter's words.       Huang Mingli is a middle-aged man in his forties and fifties, although he is wearing civilian clothes, he reveals a majestic momentum all over his body. This is the official authority formed by the people who have been in the top position for a long time.       At the same time, Huang Mingli was also looking at Leng Feng. Under this scrutiny, he couldn't help frowning. It's not that he is dissatisfied with Leng Feng, but the Leng Feng that Huang Mingli sees now seems to be different from the Leng Feng in his impression.       Although Huang Mingli had never seen Leng Feng before, he had a lot of news about Leng Feng in his hands. To be able to climb from the seventh-rank county order to the third-grade within the thirteenth or fourteenth time, to be precise, it will be the important members of the court who are the third rank soon, and Huang Mingli's eyesight is naturally needless to say.       Over the years, he has read countless people and seen many young talents, including noble sons who came out of poor families, and handsome people. But at this time, the temperament shown by Leng Feng is definitely not weaker than those people.Whether it is from Leng Feng's figure and behavior at this time, or the momentum that is revealed, he does not look like the legendary young master.       Although Leng Feng has just crossed into this world for less than a month, he is now the same as the previous Leng Da Shao. At this time, his aura was lofty, and his eyebrows were full of heroism, even when he went to that station, his body was tall and generous.       Just when Huang Mingli and Leng Feng's eyes intertwined, the porter who led Leng Feng in bowed down and said, "Master, the guest has been brought!" ”
       Huang Mingli didn't speak, waved his hand, and the porter turned to leave.       Leng Feng hurriedly stepped forward and made a junior salute, "Little nephew Leng Feng meets Uncle Huang!" ”
       At this time, Leng Feng's etiquette and words were very particular, first of all, he did the junior ceremony, and did not pay a big salute because Huang Mingli was the prefect of Jiankang Mansion. Instead, he saluted as a junior to see an elder, which was to let Huang Mingli know that he Leng Feng was the son of an old man, and this old man had a life-saving grace for him.       Secondly, the purpose of verbally referring to each other as nephew and uncle is to further determine the identity relationship between the two parties.       At the same time, he also expressed an attitude to Huang Mingli, he Leng Feng did not come to Huang Mingli's identity as a prefect.       Sure enough, after hearing this, a smile appeared on the corner of Huang Mingli's mouth: "Haha, you are Leng Feng's nephew, time flies so fast, you are so old in a blink of an eye, I think you were just an infant baby when I first saw you!" ”
       "It's the little nephew who doesn't know the etiquette, and he hasn't seen his uncle all these years! Thinking that in some time, the little nephew will be crowned, and now that the father is not there, the little nephew came to see his uncle, and implored his uncle to witness the little nephew and the little nephew. ”

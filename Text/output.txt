Mo Xiu
At Shun City First High School.
In the classroom of Year 3 Class 1…
“There are still more than ten days left until the college entrance examination. Everyone must revise their theoretical knowledge, especially those who have yet to awaken their abilities. You must thoroughly research the theories behind your abilities. However, the awakened students must not be careless either. The college entrance examination will really determine a person’s fate.”
A man dressed in black was standing at the podium. He was Gao Quan, the form teacher of Year 3 Class 1.
Unlike the other relaxed students, Mo Xiu’s eyes were filled with seriousness and determination.
After all, Mo Xiu knew that the college entrance examination might not be that important to those with good family backgrounds.
However, to him, this was an opportunity to change his fate, an opportunity that he had no choice but to seize.
Gao Quan continued, “We will start self-studying until noon. After lunch, we will train at the training grounds.”
After Gao Quan finished speaking, he turned and left. Some of the students started chatting when they saw the form teacher leaving.
“Hey, have you guys heard? Zhou Qiuwu from Class Two awakened his skills yesterday. It’s said that he awakened two skills.”
“Really? Two skills? That’s too strong. He’s pulling away from us. Do you know what skills he has?”
“Of course, he’s from a prestigious family. There’s no need to talk about his talent. Anyway, are you an idiot? Who wouldn’t keep their skills a secret?”
“True, true!”
Mo Xiu ignored the students around him. Instead, he began to revise the curriculum from his first year of high school, which included the origins of skills, and the basic analysis of these skills.
He flipped to the first page of his notes, which detailed the origins of skills.
“Skills are a special gift bestowed upon humans by the heavens. A meteor landed on Earth, and the meteor emitted a huge light. Then, invisible radiation swept across the entire world, creating the current world. That meteor was named ‘The Beginning’, and it is now being kept by the Sea Race…”
On the second page…
“From then on, humans were bestowed with extraordinary abilities, which are currently known as the four skills. Everyone has four skills. On the day of their 18th birthday, they will awaken their first skill. After that, they will awaken one skill every year.”
These game-like abilities landed on Earth, and Earth underwent a tremendous change.
Mo Xiu’s birthday was tomorrow, and he had yet to awaken his abilities. If the college entrance examination could change his fate, then awakening would decide his fate.
The strength and use of one’s skills directly determined the direction of a person’s future development.
Therefore, when his 18th birthday was approaching, he was filled with anxiety.
Unknowingly, the afternoon bell rang.
Ring ring ring…
“Hey! Mo Xiu, stop reading. It’s time to eat. Are you really going to start revising your theoretical knowledge from scratch?”
The person who spoke was Zheng Yi, Mo Xiu’s only friend in high school.
Mo Xiu calmly closed his book and smiled calmly. “Why not?”
Zheng Yi was stunned for a moment before saying, “That’s up to you. Let’s go and eat!”
Then, the two of them went to the canteen to eat. The moment they sat down, Zheng Yi sneakily whispered into Mo Xiu’s ear.
“Mo Xiu, there’s a gathering tonight. Come with me.”
As Mo Xiu ate, he glanced at Zheng Yi and shook his head. “No, I have to train at the training grounds tonight.”
Zheng Yi pursed his lips and said, “How boring. Mu Qingyi will be attending this gathering as well. Don’t say that I won’t help you.”
Mu Qingyi was the class monitor. With Mo Xiu, they were the two most hardworking people in the entire class.
The two of them were usually the last to leave the school, so they usually had some interactions.
When Zheng Yi saw that Mo Xiu seemed to be very close to Mu Qingyi, he decided to play the role of a matchmaker.
“I won’t go no matter who goes!”
“You’re practically a block of wood.”
…
At the training grounds of Shun City First High School.
“Ah! So handsome! Mo Xiu has broken the speed record again!”
“That’s right, that’s right. He finished this 100-meter race in 7.65 seconds. Oh my god, could this be a school record?”
“The two of you, stop being love-struck. Can’t you see Mo Xiu’s face? Don’t even think about it.”
A group of girls were discussing Mo Xiu.
The college entrance examination was divided into three categories. The first was a theory test, the second was a physical test, and the third was a skill test.
There was no need to explain the theory test. It would test the knowledge they had learned from their textbooks.
The physical test included a strength test, a speed test, and a combat test.
Meanwhile, the skill test involved using a computer-simulated enemy to test the usage and strength of one’s skills.
There was no need for Mo Xiu to worry about the first two categories. After all, he was first in school for the theory component, while the results of his physical test were even better.
There was a saying in Shun City First High School. The results of the physical test could be divided into three grades. The top grade was Mo Xiu, the second grade was empty, while the rest of the school was in the third grade.
The only thing Mo Xiu was worried about was the skill test. Time was too tight, and there were only ten days left until the college entrance examination.
There would be very little time to figure out his own skills.
“I ran 100 meters in 7.65 seconds, and my fist power is 230.4 kilograms. I have to work harder. Since I don’t know my skills. I have to improve my results in the two other tests as much as possible.”
Then, an abrupt and arrogant voice broke the silence.
“Mo Xiu, do you dare to compete with me?”
The newcomer was called Wang Xuanhu. He was in the same class as Mo Xiu, and his results had always been suppressed by Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi. It could be said that he was firmly in third place.
As he had been below Mo Xiu all year round, he was very unhappy.
He couldn’t stand how arrogant Mo Xiu had always been. Coincidentally, there were many people paying attention to Mo Xiu today, so he wanted to use this opportunity to embarrass Mo Xiu.
“Compete in what?”
“Compete in actual combat, of course. The college entrance examination is about actual combat. It’s not easy to find an opponent to train with, right?”
Mo Xiu thought for a moment. Indeed, he did not have much combat experience. Thus, he agreed without any hesitation.
The two of them arrived at a square-shaped field with a length and width of 25 meters. The official way to determine the winner was to either leave the boundaries of the field or fall to the ground.
Mo Xiu’s physique was terrifying, and no one had dared to challenge him throughout his three years of high school. Hence, this match had attracted a large number of onlookers.
At this moment, Zheng Yi squeezed into the crowd. When he saw someone challenging Mo Xiu, his interest was piqued.
He shouted, “Wang Xuanhu, are you itching for a beating?”
Zheng Yi wasn’t being arrogant by saying that. In a competition where skills weren’t used, Mo Xiu was invincible.
“Shall we begin?”
Mo Xiu said as he stretched out a hand and made an inviting gesture.
Wang Xuanhu did not answer. Instead, he took a big stride forward and accelerated towards Mo Xiu.
Zheng Yi shouted despicably from among the audience.
The two of them were not far from each other to begin with. Thus, Wang Xuanhu’s sudden attack had caught Mo Xiu off guard.
However, Mo Xiu’s expression was calm without a trace of panic. He exerted strength in his legs and advanced instead of retreating. Then, he arrived at Wang Xuanhu’s right in a flash and punched him in the stomach.
“Ah!”
Wang Xuanhu fell to the ground in pain. After a while, seeing that Mo Xiu did not continue attacking, he slowly stood up.
The audience started discussing. Most people felt that the gap between the two was too great and that Wang Xuanhu would definitely lose.
Wang Xuanhu lowered his head and seemed to be thinking about something. Then, he launched another attack.
This time, Wang Xuanhu dodged Mo Xiu’s kick.
Wang Xuanhu, who had dodged the attack, did not continue attacking. Instead, he grabbed Mo Xiu’s leg.
Mo Xiu would not let go of this opportunity and punched Wang Xuanhu’s chest.
Just when everyone thought that the match had ended, Wang Xuanhu flashed a sinister smile.
“First skill, Burst Sting!”
As everyone watched on in disbelief, spikes suddenly grew out of Wang Xuanhu’s body.
At this moment, it was impossible for Mo Xuesha to retract his fist. He could only make a clawing gesture with his hands to minimize the damage.
His hand firmly grabbed onto the spikes on Wang Xuanhu’s body. Then, Mo Xiu borrowed the force and pulled out his left leg to retreat.
Although Mo Xiu was prepared, he was still heavily injured. His left leg and right hand had been pierced by the spikes.
Zheng Yi rushed into the arena and said angrily to Wang Xuanhu, “Wang Xuanhu, you actually used your skill. How shameless. I’ll let you have a taste of suffering today.”
Wang Xuanhu had actually used a skill! Usually, both parties would tacitly agree not to use a skill in a competition. If they wanted to use a skill, they had to say so in advance.
Everyone knew that Mo Xiu had not awakened a single skill, so this was a deliberate trap by Wang Xuanhu.
The surrounding people also began to talk about how shameless Wang Xuanhu was. However, no one noticed that Mo Xiu was looking at his wound with excitement in his eyes.
Zheng Yi was about to charge forward when Mo Xiu grabbed him and shook his head, indicating for him not to.
Zheng Yi whispered, “Mo Xiu, how can you tolerate this? I’ll take responsibility if anything happens.”
Mo Xiu pulled Zheng Yi behind him and walked to Wang Xuanhu step by step. He extended a hand and said, “Let’s continue. How about it?”
“Ah?!”
The entire audience cried out in surprise. He was already in this state, yet he still wanted to continue?
Wang Xuanhu was stunned and did not speak.
“Right! You can use your skills!”

Lesson
Everyone was shocked. No one could understand what Mo Xiu was trying to do.
The other party was obviously trying to make Mo Xiu look bad. Thus, Mo Xiu could totally let everyone teach Wang Xuanhu a lesson.
Although Mo Xiu didn’t have many good friends, he was quite a good person. In addition, he was strong and had some prestige in the class. As long as he spoke, the others would be willing to help.
However, Mo Xiu wanted to continue fighting with Wang Xuanhu. This not only meant that he had forgiven Wang Xuanhu, but that he also wanted to make things difficult for him.
In everyone’s opinion, it was impossible for Mo Xiu to defeat Wang Xuanhu without any skills.
Wang Xuanhu was overjoyed when he realized what was going on. He did not expect Mo Xiu to be so stupid. Initially, he could not stand his bragging and wanted him to suffer.
However, if the competition were to continue, Mo Xiu would not only suffer.
“Alright, since you’ve invited me so sincerely, I’ll accept it.”
Mo Xiu did not react after hearing this. Instead, he nodded seriously.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi was furious. Wang Xuanhu was so shameless that he wanted to beat him up.
“Are you f*cking shameless? I’m going to teach you a lesson today. I’m going to make you cry.”
Mo Xiu pulled Zheng Yi back and said in a low voice, “Leave it to me. There are many ways to teach someone a lesson. Do you think I’m someone who will swallow my pride?”
Upon hearing Mo Xiu’s words, Zheng Yi calmed down and walked out of the venue. He wanted to see what Mo Xiu was up to.
At most, he would help when Mo Xiu was no match for Wang Xuanhu.
Then, Mo Xiu turned around and said to Wang Xuanhu, “Let’s begin!”
Wang Xuanhu sat on the ground and said, “Wait a moment. I’ve used a lot of energy in the competition just now. Let’s rest for a while before we begin.”
The onlookers were dumbfounded. Did he say that he used a lot of energy just now? They had only exchanged three moves. Wang Xuanhu had only suffered one punch while Mo Xiu was still bleeding.
However, Mo Xiu did not mind. He sat on the ground and looked meaningfully at Wang Xuanhu.
“Alright!”
…
Mo Xiu kept staring at Wang Xuanhu, not knowing what to think.
This was until Wang Xuanhu said that he was done resting and the competition resumed.
Wang Xuanhu stood up arrogantly and said, “Come on, let’s begin!”
This time, Mo Xiu did not act as politely as before. Instead, he immediately attacked after Wang Xuanhu finished speaking.
The strength that erupted from his legs was extremely shocking. He instantly threw a punch at Wang Xuanhu’s face.
Wang Xuanhu knew how powerful Mo Xiu was, so he did not dare to be negligent and protected his head with his arms.
“First skill, Burst Sting!”
Wang Xuanhu’s entire body was covered in spikes once again. However,Mo Xiu was clearly well-prepared this time. He transformed his fist into a knife hand strike and slashed at the gap between the two spikes on Wang Xuanhu’s arm.
Pa!
After Mo Xiu’s attack succeeded, he immediately retreated. Wang Xuanhu lowered his arms and said with a grin, “Haha, do you think you’ve found my weakness?”
Mo Xiu acted as if he did not hear Wang Xuanhu’s words and muttered to himself, “So that’s how it is.”
“Mo Xiu, what did you say?!”
“Nothing. Again!”
Before he could finish his sentence, Mo Xiu attacked again. His hand was still prepared for a knife hand strike, but he no longer delivered a chop. Instead, he used his fingertips to attack the gaps in Wang Xuanhu’s spikes. This way, he could ensure that he was not injured.
Wang Xuanhu was not someone to be trifled with. After all, he was not weak to begin with. Furthermore, with the augmentation of his skill, although he did not injure Mo Xiu, he had the upper hand after a few moves.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu relied on his nimble movements to fight and retreat. In an instant, the two of them were locked in battle.
Outside of the field, Zheng Yi frowned. Mo Xiu’s seemingly disorganized moves had a pattern to them that he was very familiar with.
At this moment, a voice from behind reminded Zheng Yi, “Do you think Mo Xiu is using
Baguazhang
?”
Zheng Yi slapped his thigh. That was right. Wasn’t Mo Xiu using Baguazhang, which was taught in the basic martial arts class in Year 1.
Mo Xiu turned Baguazhang into a knife hand strike and used his fingertips to attack. He was extremely strong and his legs were steady like in Baguazhang. Furthermore, his movements were unpredictable. Wasn’t this the same as Baguazhang?
It was as if the question in Zheng Yi’s heart had been answered. This sentence also solved the doubts of all the bystanders. For a moment, there was silence.
Oh my god, how solid were Mo Xiu’s fundamentals? To think that a basic martial arts technique that everyone despised could be used to such an extent.
At this moment, the most depressed person was Wang Xuanhu. He no longer had the confidence he had at the beginning of the competition. Instead, his brows were tightly furrowed and his expression was solemn.
He had thought that he could easily defeat Mo Xiu and humiliate him, but he hadn’t expected that he would only be able to fight to a draw even after using a skill.
Suddenly, Wang Xuanhu’s spikes disappeared. Then, Mo Xiu’s right hand transformed into a fist and punched at Wang Xuanhu’s face.
“I admit defeat!!!”
Mo Xiu’s fist stopped five centimeters away from Wang Xuanhu, who let out a long sigh.
“Phew! I admit defeat this time. I’ll consult you again next time!”
With that said, he turned to leave. At this moment, Zheng Yi ran over and said, “Mo Xiu, are you letting him go just like that? When he plotted against you, if it weren’t for your quick reflexes, you might not have just suffered such serious injuries. It might even affect your college entrance examination. If you’re afraid that it will affect you, I’ll go and deal with him.”
“He has already received his due punishment.”
Zheng Yi frowned and asked, “What punishment?”
Wang Xuanhu, who was walking away, walked back when he heard this.
Then, he regained his initial arrogance and said, “Tell me, how did you punish me?”
Mo Xiu smiled and remained calm. He ignored Wang Xuanhu’s mockery.
Instead, Mo Xiu walked step by step to Wang Xuanhu’s side and gently patted his shoulder.
Wang Xuanhu slapped Mo Xiu’s hand away and said, “Stop trying to mystify things. Speak! What the hell are you doing?!”
Mo Xiu’s voice was not too loud or too soft. He used a volume that was just enough for the surrounding crowd to hear him. He said, “Wang Xuanhu, first skill: Burst Sting. A release-type skill. His entire body will be covered in spikes. Furthermore, it increases his speed, strength, and defense by about 20%. Duration: 45 seconds. Cooldown: 30 minutes.”
Wang Xuanhu looked at Mo Xiu in disbelief. Everything Mo Xiu said was right. How… how was this possible?
The surrounding people were in an uproar. Such a detailed introduction of Wang Xuanhu’s skill would definitely affect his future development.
Everyone only had four skills and everyone would try their best to hide their skills.
This was because if two people were to fight, and one didn’t know their opponent’s skill but the opponent knew their skill, their opponent would come up with a strategy based on the characteristics of their skill. Unless one absolutely suppressed their opponent in terms of strength, it was almost impossible to defeat their opponent.
This was a very detailed introduction that even included the cooldown time. This was a heavy blow to Wang Xuanhu.
No school would take a fancy to a person who had the details of their skill fully exposed just after they had awakened their skill.
At this moment, Wang Xuanhu’s entire body was trembling as he said, “You… Even if you can estimate that the skill will improve my attributes, then… How do you know the cooldown time and duration of my skill? You’re talking nonsense, right! You’re talking nonsense!”
Mo Xiu replied with interest, “After the first round ended, the spikes on your body did not disappear. This means that your skill cannot be automatically deactivated. Therefore, during the second round, the period of time between when you release your skill to the end of your skill will be the duration of your skill!”
“What about the cooldown time?”
“Didn’t you say that you wanted to rest for a while? I’ve been watching you. With your desire to fight immediately back then, the time between when the spikes on your body retracted to the time you said you could continue fighting is the cooldown time!”
After hearing Mo Xiu’s analysis, Wang Xuanhu could not stay any longer and left in a hurry.
Mo Xiu had been ambushed and calmly proposed to continue the competition. Then, he had used the basic Baguazhang techniques to fight Wang Xuanhu to a standstill. Finally, he had used such meticulous calculations to predict Wang Xuanhu’s skill.
However, Mo Xiu’s plan to train at the training grounds after school was disrupted. Now that he was injured, he could only go home and rest.
This was also one of the reasons why Mo Xiu was angry. Another reason was that, as Zheng Yi had said, Wang Xuanhu wanted to affect his college entrance examination.
When he got home, there were dishes on the dining table and a piece of paper under the plates.
“I’m working the night shift today. Eat well and don’t miss me!”
Mo Xiu’s mother’s name was Li Yuan. She worked at a small factory. It was not easy for the mother and son to live in this chaotic world. In order to earn more money, her mother often worked overtime at night. Thus, Mo Xiu had not seen her for a few days.
Mo Xiu had witnessed the family situation and his mother’s hard work. This was also the reason why he had been working so hard to learn and train.
After dinner, he lay on the bed and quietly waited for the clock to strike midnight.
As long as the clock struck midnight, Mo Xiu would awaken one of his skills. Thus, he was extremely nervous.
“What exactly will my first skill be? The books say that when it’s my birthday, three skills will appear in my mind. I can choose one of them as my skill. What will mine be?”
Perhaps it was because he was too tired from the battle, or perhaps it was because he was too nervous. Mo Xiu fell asleep.
When it was almost midnight, Li Yuan returned home. After all, it was her son’s birthday at midnight. At the same time, her son was going to awaken his skills.
No matter what, she had to come back to accompany her son.
Seeing that Mo Xiu was already asleep, she sat by the bed to accompany him.
Li Yuan looked at Mo Xiu apologetically.
She had seen Mo Xiu’s hard work all these years. Although she was earning money to support her family, Li Yuan knew that the amount of hard work that Mo Xiu had put in was no less than hers.
Mo Xiu wanted to change his fate and his mother’s fate.
At midnight…
A huge wave of energy crashed into Mo Xiu’s mind, causing him to wake up with a start. After that, his gaze became dull.
During an awakening, the brain would be in a blank state and would not sense anything from the outside world.
Li Yuan became nervous when she saw this. She knew that the awakening had begun.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu nervously looked at the skill pattern in his mind that was floating over from afar.
As the pattern got closer, Mo Xiu began to realize that something was wrong. Why was there only one pattern? Could it be that he couldn’t choose?
The pattern became clear, and Mo Xiu focused his gaze.
“Passive Skill: Flip.”
???
“What is a passive skill?”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!

a type of Chinese martial art of the Wudang school



                    



Awakening
A passive skill? What was that? It hadn’t been recorded in the books throughout his three years of high school. No one had mentioned it.
When the skill pattern appeared, Mo Xiu was even more confused.
There was only one pattern with the word “Flip” written on it. Even the skill introduction was nowhere to be found.
The books clearly stated that when a person awakened their skills, they would be in a special state. In the outside world, a person would be in a blank state, but in reality, their brain would be operating rapidly, and they would be choosing their skills.
The three subsequent awakenings would be the same. Three skill patterns would appear in one’s mind, and the names and introduction of the skills would be displayed.
However, only one pattern appeared in Mo Xiu’s mind. There was no choice to make, and there was no introduction. This meant that Mo Xiu didn’t know what this skill was used for.
Even in such a situation, Mo Xiu was still very calm. There was no time limit to choosing a skill during an awakening, so Mo Xiao wanted to wait and see if things would take a turn for the better.
Mo Xiu didn’t know how long he had been waiting in this awakening state, where he had no sense of the flow of time. Everything in front of him remained the same. Meanwhile, the ‘Flip’ skill was looking at him coldly.
“I don’t know how much time has passed in the outside world. I can’t drag this on any longer. If my skill is going to be ‘Flip’, then so be it!”
Mo Xiu was helpless and could only force himself to choose this skill.
When he came into contact with the skill pattern, the skill transformed into a golden light and surged into his mind.
Just as Mo Xun wanted to check this skill, he realized that he could not control his body.
In other words, he had yet to escape from this state of awakening. What was going on?
Amidst his confusion, another light appeared before his eyes. As the light approached him, three patterns appeared.
Hm? Was the choice just now fake? Had the awakening just begun?
When the three skill patterns came to a stop, Mo Xiu carefully examined them.
“Skill: Infinite Exploding Flames.”
“Effect: Summons explosive flames.”
“Cooldown: 5 minutes.”
“Skill: God’s Eye.”
“Effect: Checks the approximate skill effect, as well as the detailed cooldown and duration of the target’s skills. It can only be used on one target.”
“Cooldown: 1 hour.”
“Skill: Descent of the Martial God.”
“Effect: Increases all attributes (speed, strength, endurance, etc.) by 100%.”
“Duration: 3 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
Even when an accident happened, he didn’t panic. However, after seeing these three skills, Mo Xiu couldn’t remain calm anymore.
“Hm? Aren’t these skills too powerful?”
After exclaiming in surprise, Mo Xiu fell into deep thought. These three skills were too powerful. Each had their own advantages.
Infinite Bursting Flames had a short cooldown time. Although the effect of the skill did not specify how powerful it was, it should not be too bad. Generally, such explosive skills that could cover a range would have a long cooldown time.
Having a short cooldown meant that he could use multiple deadly skills in a battle.
Meanwhile, Descent of the Martial God was easier to understand. It was used to increase one’s attributes. The 100% increase in all of his attributes was very scary. Usually, buff-type skills that had just been awakened would only improve one attribute, such as speed. Furthermore, the increase in attributes would not be that large.
As for God’s Eye, it was the skill that shocked Mo Xiu the most. He had never heard of a skill that could directly check the skills of others. Just like Wang Hu’s skill, maintaining the secrecy of one’s skills was very important.
If he knew his opponent’s skills before the battle, he would have a higher chance of winning.
After hesitating for a while, Mo Xiu prepared to choose between God’s Eye and Descent of the Martial God.
God’s Eye was simply cheating. Mo Xiu didn’t want to let go of this skill.
On the other hand, Descent of the Martial God could increase his strength in a short period of time. Mo Xiu had been studying combat since he was young. Thus, this skill was very suitable for him.
One of the skills provided him with special privileges, but it would be much help to him in the college entrance examination. Meanwhile, the other skill could help him achieve good results in the college entrance examination.
This was a question of whether to choose a skill that would help him in the present or the future.
After hesitating for a while, Mo Xiu still decided to choose Descent of the Martial God. It would be more helpful.
After his consciousness touched the skill, the skill that contained Descent of the Martial God also turned into golden light and entered his mind.
After making his choice, the patterns of the other two skills didn’t disappear. Mo Xiu furrowed his eyebrows.
What was going on? Why were there so many strange things happening when he awakened his skills?
Could it be that there was something wrong with the skills and he couldn’t choose Descent of the Martial God?
Mo Xiu shook his head and used his consciousness to touch God’s Eye.
This time, before the golden light dissipated, everything before Mo Xiue turned white. Then, he opened his eyes.
This… What had happened? This awakening felt like a dream.
Mo Xiu suddenly sat up and concentrated. Then, two images appeared in his mind.
One of them was Flip, while the other was God’s Eye.
“Hm? What’s going on? Why do I have two skills? Did I also awaken two skills at once? No, according to the records, if there are multiple skills during the first awakening, the entire awakening process will be split into two parts. After choosing the first skill, I will wake up. Then, I will enter the state of awakening again within a day.”
“Little Xiu, are you awake?”
A voice interrupted Mo Xiu’s thoughts. He looked up and saw that it was his mother.
Mo Xiu did not wake up the entire night, and Li Yuan stayed by his side the entire night.
“Have you awakened your skills?”
“Yes!”
“Are the skills okay?”
“They’re not bad.”
“That’s good. Get up and eat. I’ll make you a bowl of longevity noodles.”
His mother didn’t ask any more questions. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu didn’t say anything because he knew his mother believed he could handle everything.
After briefly tidying up, Mo Xiu came to the dining table and looked at the simple bowl of longevity noodles, feeling a little touched.
All these years, his mother had been supporting this family alone, so it was very difficult to earn money.
Once he went to university, he would get a scholarship and do some part-time jobs to earn money.
“Mom, thank you!”
Li Yuan smiled and said, “Rascal, why are you being so polite with your mother?”
Mo Xiu scratched his head and said, “Hehe, thank you very much.”
Not long after his meal, Mo Xiu left. Although he was looking forward to testing his skills, he still had to go to school today. Thus, he couldn’t find a quiet place to study his skills.
When Mo Xiu reached the school gate, he bumped into Zheng Yi. Mo Xiu was a little puzzled. This fellow was always the last to arrive. Why was he here so early today?
“Morning, Zheng Yi. Did the sun rise from the west today? You’re early.”
Zheng Yi said unhappily, “You’re so heartless. I know that it’s your birthday and day of awakening, so I came early to wait for you. Hey! How’s your skill?”
In this era, everyone knew the importance of hiding their skills. Thus, Zheng Yi didn’t directly ask Mo Xiu what his skill was, but rather what it was for.
Mo Xiu paused for a moment before saying, “Not bad, but it won’t be of much help to the college entrance examination.”
“Oh? Does that mean that it’s not a combat skill? Out of 100 points, how many points will you give your own skill?”
“I would give it 95 points.”
Zheng Yi was rather surprised. He knew Mo Xiu well. Although Mo Xiu usually joked around, he was very serious when it came to things. A score of 95 points was not low.
It looked like Mo Xiu’s skill was pretty good. Zheng Yi was genuinely happy for Mo Xiu.
In reality, Mo Xiu did not hide anything. The reason why he gave it a score of 95 instead of 100 was because there were too many strange things during the awakening process. Thus, he was unable to determine the strength of the skill.
Oh right, wouldn’t it be fine if he tried using God’s Eye? He just didn’t know if it would have any effect when he used it.
With this thought in mind, Mo Xiu grabbed Zheng Yi’s arm and dragged him to the path beside the school.
“Hey, hey, hey, Mo Xiu, what are you doing?”
Mo Xiu looked at Zheng Yi seriously and said, “I’m sorry!”
After that, Mo Xiu used God’s Eye on Zheng Yi and a message appeared in Mo Xiu’s mind.
“First Skill: Purple Lightning.”
“Effect: After being released, the entire body will be enveloped by purple lightning. This skill increases speed by 100%. When attacking, there will be a paralyzing effect.”
“Duration: 2 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
He could really read other people’s skills with so much detail. This was incredible.
Mo Xiu suppressed the excitement in his heart and raised his head to look at Zheng Yi. “Was there anything strange about me just now? For example, did I emit any light?”
Zheng Yi said with a puzzled look, “No, why? Why are you asking such strange questions every now and then?”
Mo Xiu said, “Alright, class is starting soon. Let’s go back.”
Zheng Yi nodded and walked back.
However, Mo Xiu suddenly stopped after taking two steps, his eyes filled with shock.
This was because when Mo Xiu looked at the skill in his mind, the skill had changed. The name under the skill pattern was “Descent of the Martial God”.
???
Had his skill changed? Why? Could it be… Flip!!!Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

I Can Read Through You
Zheng Yi, who was walking in front, was a little angry when he saw Mo Xiu stop in his tracks.
“Mo Xiu, why are you acting so strange today? Let’s go back to class.”
“Oh, I’ll be right there.”
When they returned to the classroom, since the college entrance examination was about to begin, they had to attend a self-study session in the morning. Then, they would go to the training grounds in the afternoon.
Mo Xiu sat in his seat in a daze as he carefully checked his skills.
The passive skill did not change at all. Meanwhile, God’s Eye was gone and had been replaced by Descent of the Martial God.
After thinking about it, Mo Xiu felt that there was a possibility that everything he saw when he awakened was real. He had indeed chosen three skills.
He had one passive skill and two active skills. Under normal circumstances, only one active skill could be seen, and the effect of the passive skill was to switch between the two active skills. However, the trigger conditions were unknown, and the active skills could not be automatically switched.
A passive skill? What exactly was a passive skill?
Mo Xiu suddenly got up and ran out of the classroom to the library.
The third-year students could also choose to study in the library. However, the college entrance examination now emphasized on combat ability and the strength of their skills. Thus, there were typically not many people here.
Throughout the entire morning, Mo Xiu read through many books, but he couldn’t find any records regarding passive skills.
The only skills mentioned that were similar to his passive skill were the skills of beasts.
Beasts did not have four skills like humans. They only had one skill, but it had a high growth rate.
Ever since the meteorite landed in the human world, both humans and animals had mutated. Their physical abilities had increased significantly, and they had developed skills. In addition, the intelligence of animals had increased significantly, and they had been fighting with other creatures for more than ten years.
In the end, both parties signed an agreement to not interfere with each other. Humans lived in the center of the continent while animals lived in the periphery.
Although there would be occasional conflicts, such conflicts were just isolated phenomena. There would not be large-scale wars. This was also the reason why humans were living rather comfortably.
After a fruitless search, Mo Xiu sat on the chair dejectedly. What should he do? Passive skills had never appeared before, so how could he trigger the Flip skill again?
“Hello, student, I noticed that you have been reading many books here. Do you have any doubts?”
Mo Xiu’s thoughts were interrupted by a sudden elderly voice. He looked up and saw that it was the librarian who usually stayed in the library.
“Ah, hello. There are indeed some things that I can’t figure out.”
The old man slowly sat down and took the book from Mo Xiu’s hands. He closed it and placed it under his palm.
“Tell me about it. I’ve been here for ten years and am familiar with every individual here.”
Individual? Shouldn’t they be all books?
Mo Xiu was puzzled, but he still asked his question. “May I ask what types of skills there are?”
The old man slowly said, “Skills are divided into release-type skills, state-type skills, one-time skills and variant-type skills.”
“Oh, what about the larger categories?”
Mo Xiu obviously wouldn’t directly ask if this man knew what a passive skill was. He could only ask bit by bit.
“There are attack-type skills, detection-type skills, confusion-type skills, and special-type skills.”
“What about the even larger categories?”
“There are skills that can grow, and skills that cannot grow.”
“Even larger!”
“You! What exactly do you want to ask?”
Mo Xiu stood up and scratched his head. “Nothing. I was just asking. I’m leaving. Sorry for disturbing you!”
“I can read through you.”
Mo Xiu didn’t understand what the old man meant. He could only smile, nod, and retreat.
“Skills are divided into ordinary skills and innate skills. Innate skills are not only possessed by wild beasts, but also by some humans. For example… The royalty!”
Mo Xiu, who was walking away, paused when he heard this. This old man was definitely not simple.
At this thought, Mo Xiu quickened his pace.
Meanwhile, the old man watched as Mo Xiu left, the corners of his lips curling up as if he had discovered something interesting.
…
After Mo Xiu came out of the library, he had a simple meal before heading to the training grounds. He wanted to test out the Descent of the Martial God skill when there were fewer people in the training grounds.
The innate skill that the old man mentioned might be a passive skill, but how could he be a member of the royal family? If he couldn’t figure it out, he might as well not think about it anymore.
When he arrived at the training grounds, it was unknown if it was because the college entrance examination was approaching or if it was just a coincidence, but it was already crowded at noon.
Since he was already here, Mo Xiu could only carry out his normal training. Furthermore, Descent of the Martial God increased all his attributes by 100%. The higher his base attributes were, the stronger his abilities would be after he used his skill.
When he arrived at the specially-made treadmill, Mo Xiu prepared to train his speed and endurance to the point of exhaustion as usual. Then, he would rest for a period of time before continuing to train his strength.
Mo Xiu had concluded that this method could allow him to stimulate his potential and break through his limits.
However, before Mo Xiu could start training, he saw Zheng Yi running over unhappily.
“I say, Mo Xiu, aren’t you too mean? Why did you run away after attending the self-study session? I’ve been looking everywhere for you but I couldn’t find you.”
Mo Xiu awkwardly said, “I went to the library to look up some information and forgot to tell you.”
Zheng Yi put his hands on his waist and said, “It’s alright. I’m a magnanimous person. I forgive you…”
“Bang!!!”
Before Zheng Yi could finish, there was a loud bang from the ceiling.
There was a huge hole in the alloy ceiling of the training grounds. Then, a three-meter-tall shadow fell from the sky along with the dust.
As the dust settled, everyone present exclaimed.
“Heavens, is… Is this a ferocious beast?”
This was indeed a ferocious beast, a huge creature similar to an eagle. It stood at the center of the training grounds, giving off an invisible pressure.
Mo Xiu frowned and said, “This is a Demonic Eagle. It has two forms and hasn’t entered combat mode. Run!”
Mo Xiu’s voice grew louder and louder. When he said the word ‘run’ at the end, he practically roared.
Upon hearing Mo Xiu’s warning, everyone reacted and immediately ran towards the door.
Mo Xiu had seen this species in a book before. Its name was the Demonic Eagle. It had a violent nature and its skill was transformation.
Demonic Eagles had two forms. The first form was its flight form, where its attack power was slightly lower.
The other was the form after transformation. Its wings would be retracted back into its body and replaced by two strong front limbs. After transformation, the Demonic Eagle’s strength would increase and it would become bloodthirsty.
Even with Mo Xiu’s reminder, everyone still took too long to react. At this moment, the Demonic Eagle’s black wings were gone and were replaced by a pair of blood-red forelimbs.
The Demonic Eagle took a step forward and was as fast as lightning. In an instant, it arrived at the door and blocked everyone’s path.
Everyone panicked and looked at Mo Xiu. However, they didn’t expect Mo Xiu to defeat the Demonic Eagle. They simply looked at Mo Xiu as he had just recognized it.
Mo Xiu lowered his head slightly and threw his jacket to the ground.

A Matter of Life and Death
Mo Xiu wasn’t trying to be a hero, nor was he going back on his word. He had just told everyone to run, and now he was telling them to fight.
Just now, he wanted to take advantage of the fact that the Demonic Eagle had yet to enter its battle form to escape. However, the Demonic Eagle was already blocking the entrance. It seemed like it would not be able to get far away from there. If they tried to escape, it would only cause chaos and cause more damage.
What they needed to do now was to hold the Demonic Eagle back. Such a huge commotion would definitely alert the teachers. They could only resolve this crisis when the teachers arrived.
However, before Mo Xiu could rush over to fight, the Demonic Eagle made its move. With a sweep of its huge arm, it sent the students who had reached the exit flying.
In the end, the Demonic Eagle grabbed one of the girls and wanted to put her into its mouth.
Mo Xiu shouted, “Not good!” Then, he simply activated Descent of the Martial God and charged forward at full speed.
Mo Xiu wasn’t a saint, but if a classmate lost his life before his eyes and he didn’t lend a helping hand, he would still feel bad.
Originally, Mo Xiu’s physique was already astonishing. With the augmentation of his skill, he was as fast as lightning and instantly arrived in front of Demonic Eagle.
What surprised Mo Xiu was that even with his full strength, there were still two people ahead of him.
One of them was Zheng Yi, who was surrounded by purple electric currents. The other was a young man that Mo Xiu didn’t recognize. He wore glasses and was very thin. He didn’t look like someone who could burst out with such speed.
Zheng Yi’s fist was surrounded with purple lightning as he punched the arm of the Demonic Eagle, which was holding onto a student. It was obvious that Demonic Eagle’s arm had slowed down.
As for the bespectacled youth, he was even more exaggerated. The muscles all over his body instantly swelled up. At this moment, one could no longer tell that he was thin and weak. His muscles were even more exaggerated than those of a bodybuilder.
Then, he jumped up high and grabbed onto the Demonic Eagle’s wrist. With a bit of strength, he pulled the Demonic Eagle’s entire arm to the ground.
The Demonic Eagle was clearly surprised that a human could possess such power. However, it only paused for a moment before raising its arm.
After exerting such strength, the bespectacled youth was clearly struggling. Meanwhile, Zheng Yi continued to strike the Demonic Eagle’s arm to reduce the pressure on the bespectacled youth.
However, the two of them only lasted for less than a second as the Demonic Eagle’s strength was too great. The bespectacled youth was already lifted up. Then, the Demonic Eagle’s other arm swung over, ready to deal the bespectacled youth a fatal blow.
It was a matter of life and death! Zheng Yi panicked and threw another punch, shouting, “Mo Xiu!!!”
Zheng Yi naturally saw Mo Xiu rushing over and could only seek help from Mo Xiu.
In reality, Mo Xiu had not been idle during this period of time. Instead, he had taken the opportunity when Demonic Eagle’s attention was completely on Zheng Yi and the bespectacled youth to sneak around to Demonic Eagle’s side.
Just as Demonic Eagle lifted up the bespectacled youth, Mo Xiu moved. He leaped in front of Demonic Eagle and punched out with both fists like a cannonball. His target was the Demonic Eagle’s eyes.
Before the Demonic Eagle could react, Mo Xiu’s two punches landed squarely on its eyes.
“Ao!!!”
The Demonic Eagle retracted its hands to protect its eyes. Only then did Zheng Yi, the bespectacled youth, and the female student who had just been caught escape.
However, the Demonic Eagle was blocking the entrance and no one could escape.
Mo Xiu turned around and was shocked. The people behind him weren’t idle.
Instead, a few people with flying skills were helping to transport those with weaker combat abilities and those who had yet to reach the age of 18 and awaken their skills.
Their exit was the hole that the Demonic Eagle had smashed into the roof of the training grounds.
Those who could come here to train at this time were mostly those who had not awakened or felt that their skills were not ideal after their awakening.
At this moment, they were abnormally united. Everyone knew that Mo Xiu, Zheng Yi, and the bespectacled youth were the strongest people here.
Whether or not they could escape today depended on these three people. Therefore, some people organized themselves into groups. One team went to help the three of them, while the other team quickly transported the people who did not have combat power.
At this moment, Mo Xiu also understood that the situation was more serious than he had imagined. Descent of the Martial God could last for three minutes, while Zheng Yi’s Purple Lightning could last for two minutes.
Mo Xiu did not know what the skill of the bespectacled young man was. It seemed like it was a buff or transformation skill. There should be a time limit to his skill as well.
If the three strongest people wanted to stop the Demonic Eagle, they had to do the opposite of what they were doing now. They had to increase the tempo of their attacks and deal serious damage to the Demonic Eagle within the time limit.
“The two of you, attack the Demonic Eagle immediately and harass it as much as you can without getting hurt.”
When Zheng Yi and the bespectacled youth heard Mo Xiu’s words, they rushed forward without any hesitation.
Mo Xiu wanted to let the two of them stall the Demonic Eagle for a while as he looked for any weapons that could severely injure it.
When Mo Xiu saw how much time he had left, he was shocked again.
Descent of the Martial God had disappeared and God’s Eye appeared again. Could it be that the passive skill was a skill that automatically changed his active skill after he used his active skill?
This thought flashed through his mind. Now was not the time to think about this. Mo Xiu immediately turned around and activated his skill, God’s Eye, on the Demonic Eagle.
“Talent Skill: Enchantment.”
“Skill Effect: Retracts the wings from under one’s armpits and regrows one’s arms. Reduces speed by 50%, increases strength by 200%, and increases defense by 500% (with the exception of the wings under one’s armpits).”
This… This skill was simply abnormal. Not only was it powerful, but it also did not have a cooldown time and could be used at will.
Wait a minute, its defense had increased, except for the wing area under its armpits. This was equivalent to directly revealing the weakness of the Demonic Eagle.
“How awesome!”
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but sigh at how abnormal his skill was. He couldn’t help but blurt out, “How awesome.”
Zheng Yi, who was entangled with the Demonic Eagle, thought that Mo Xiu was praising him when he heard this. He actually grinned widely at Mo Xiu.
Zheng Yi’s expression seemed to say, “You think I’m awesome too, don’t you?”
Mo Xiu was helpless. Zheng Yi’s heart was too big. He could still show off in such a situation.
However, Zheng Yi only showed off for a moment before the purple lightning on his body disappeared. After the skill duration was up, he entered a cooldown state and his combat power was greatly reduced.
They could originally take the opportunity while the Demonic Eagle’s vision had not recovered to barely deal with the Demonic Eagle. Now, all the pressure was on the bespectacled youth.
Just as Mo Xiu was about to rush forward to save Zheng Yi, the people supporting him from the side swarmed forward and charged towards the Demonic Eagle.
Zheng Yi, who was unable to use his skill, also followed them.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu made a prompt decision. He picked up two barbells and charged forward.
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi had activated their skills together. Once Zheng Yi’s skill duration was up, he would only have one minute to prove himself. Thus, he had to hurry.
“Zheng Yi, Glasses, come here.”
Zheng Yi and the bespectacled youth came to Mo Xiu’s side.
Then, Mo Xiu whispered to them.
Zheng Yi did not say a word. Meanwhile, the bespectacled youth said, “It’s feasible, but are you confident that all of your moves will be accurate?”
Mo Xiu nodded seriously and said, “Yes, there’s no time. Let’s go!”
The three of them ran side by side towards the Demonic Eagle. When they were nearby, Zheng Yi suddenly sped up and squatted down in front of Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu’s foot landed on Zheng Yi’s back. It was unclear whether it was due to the strength of the kick or because Zheng Yi was exerting strength, but a loud shout resounded throughout the entire venue.
“Ah! Go! Mo Xiu!”
Zheng Yi used his strength to push Mo Xiu off the ground. Mo Xiu also used his strength and managed to jump over the Demonic Eagle’s head.
The Demonic Eagle naturally wouldn’t let Mo Xiu off. It raised its hands above its head, preparing to slap Mo Xiu to death.
However, Mo Xiu seemed to have expected this. He held the barbells in his hand and looked at the Demonic Eagle quietly.
The Demonic Eagle’s palm was about to close, and Mo Xiu’s skill was about to reach its time limit.
Suddenly, a huge palm appeared above Mo Xiu. With a full force push from the palm, Mo Xiu bounced off the Demonic Eagle’s back like a cannonball.
The one who had launched this attack was the bespectacled youth.
The Demonic Eagle’s hands landed on the space between Mo Xiu and the Demonic Eagle, missing its target.
At this moment, Mo Xiu was falling rapidly with his back facing the Demonic Eagle. He was about to reach the time limit of his skill.
Five…
Four…
Three…
“Pfft!” Mo Xiu stabbed the two barbells into Demonic Eagle’s armpits.
Mo Xiu ran and jumped over the Demonic Eagle’s head. Then, the bespectacled man used his palm to change Mo Xiu’s path. In the end, Mo Xiu stabbed the Demonic Eagle’s vital points. The entire process occurred in one smooth action.
At this moment, Mo Xiu’s movements were extremely strange. With his back facing the Demonic Eagle, he held two barbells and stabbed them into the Demonic Eagle’s body. His entire body seemed to be performing some kind of gymnastics.
The Demonic Eagle sat down on its hind claws, unable to resist anymore.
They had succeeded. He did not have absolute confidence in any of the steps just now. This was a complete gamble. Fortunately, they had won.
Mo Xiu could sense that the Demonic Eagle had lost its ability to fight, but he still held onto the metal rod and hung it on its back.
He let out a long sigh and said, “Hu! We’ve succeeded!”
…
An old man had appeared at the corner of the training grounds. If Mo Xiu saw him, he would definitely be surprised. This was because this old man was the librarian.
The old man looked at Mo Xiu as if he had seen a treasure. He muttered to himself, “What have I discovered?”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Li Yuan
Shortly after the dust settled, the teachers of the school arrived at the scene.
Mo Xiu’s form teacher, Gao Quan, was also the first batch of people to arrive. When he found out what had happened, he was extremely shocked. Three students had actually managed to defeat an adult Demonic Eagle together.
At this moment, Mo Xiu and the other two were enjoying the warm applause from the other students.
Mo Xiu extended his right hand and said to the bespectacled youth, “Hello, my name is Mo Xiu. This is Zheng Yi.”
At this moment, the bespectacled youth had already recovered his thin and frail figure. After adjusting his spectacles, he held Mo Xiu’s hand and said, “I’m Liu Qingyu. I’ve already heard of how powerful you are. From the looks of it, everyone’s evaluation of you is still too low.”
Mo Xiu was stunned for a moment. He had originally thought that Liu Qingyu was an introverted person. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have such skills without any fame.
However, after hearing Liu Qingyu’s generous and appropriate words, he realized that this person was definitely not simple. He was not famous only because he kept a low profile.
Mo Xiu wanted to chat more with Liu Qingyu, but Zheng Yi interrupted them.
“What are the two of you talking about? There’s only one word to summarize this battle. Impressive! Haha, Mo Xiu is really impressive. This battle was freaking enjoyable.”
Mo Xiu sighed helplessly, knowing that any serious topic would be led astray by Zheng Yi.
Liu Qingyu said cooperatively, “It was awesome, awesome!”
Upon seeing the teachers walk over, Liu Qingyu immediately clasped his hands and bade them farewell.
“Goodbye, both of you. I’m in Year 3 Class 2. If you need any help, feel free to look for me. I don’t like being in the limelight, so I’ll take my leave first.”
Mo Xiu was puzzled. Liu Qingyu was really strange.
The group of teachers was led by Gao Quan. Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi were both Gao Quan’s students, so they were very familiar with each other. Although the teachers had many questions, they only asked a few simple questions before leaving.
Their top priority now was to appease his classmates and investigate why Demonic Eagle suddenly appeared in school.
After all, Shun City First High School was not located at the edge of the human residential area, and it was rare for wild beasts to appear here. For it to appear in the campus, things were definitely not that simple.
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi returned to their respective homes. After this battle, they were exhausted.
Actual combat and training were completely different, especially this type of extremely tense battle that expended even more stamina.
The entire process took less than three minutes, but to Mo Xiu, it was even more tiring than training for an entire afternoon.
When Mo Xiu returned home and realized that his mother was still not around, he went straight to her room to lie down.
When he looked at his skill, it had indeed become the Descent of the Martial God skill again. However, it was still on cooldown and couldn’t be used.
Unknowingly, Mo Xiu fell asleep. When he woke up again, he was woken up by his mother.
“Little Xiu, get up and eat. It’s your birthday today. I’ve stewed your favorite mountain chicken.”
Following his mother to the dining table, he looked at the four dishes and soup on the table. Mo Xiu was somewhat moved.
In this era, since one’s birthday and awakening were on the same day, the meaning of birthdays had already faded.
Ordinary families would first take a look at the skills their children had awakened. If the skills were good, they would invite their relatives and friends to celebrate.
However, if the awakened skill was not ideal, some parents might comfort their children, but most parents would be unhappy and even give their children a stern look, let alone celebrate.
The parents could not be completely blamed for this. It was caused by the environment. After all, skills were too important to a person.
However, Li Yuan was different. She would meticulously celebrate every birthday for Mo Xiu. Furthermore, she didn’t care much about his skills.
It was just like when she had seen Mo Xiu awaken in the morning. She had only asked him a simple question, but Mo Xiu had simply replied that his skill was not bad.
After that, his mother never mentioned anything about his awakening or his skills. Perhaps this was his mother’s love and trust for him.
Mo Xiu lowered his head and ate. He didn’t say anything about what had happened today, afraid that his mother would be worried.
This was also Mo Xiu’s old problem. He always reported good news without any bad news.
“Mom, I’m going to Yanjing University. When that time comes, don’t work here anymore. Come with me to Yanjing.”
Her mother picked up a piece of chicken and placed it in Mo Xiu’s bowl. She smiled and said, “I’m getting old and don’t want to be a burden anymore. Go and chase after your goal. I won’t hold you back.”
“Mom, I don’t want you to stay here alone. You’ve taken care of me for 18 years. I’ll take care of you when I get into university.”
Li Yuan knocked Mo Xiu’s head with her chopsticks. This was a common action when he was young, but it had been many years since she had beaten Mo Xiu like this.
“This world isn’t as simple as you think it is. When I was young, I asked you if you wanted to be successful or stay here with your mother for the rest of your life. At that time, your answer had already determined my answer today.”
“Mom…”
“Don’t say anything else! Just come back and visit Mom when you have the chance.”
Mo Xiu looked at his mother’s determined face and didn’t say another word. He clenched his fists tightly. He would never let his mother suffer again. Never!
After dinner, Mo Xiu went out to a desolate mountain near his home.
Mo Xiu had basically understood his own skills, so he was here to verify his ideas.
After looking around to make sure that there was no one around, he activated the Descent of the Martial God skill.
This time, Mo Xiu had been staring at his skill pattern. The moment he used Descent of the Martial God, the passive skill pattern changed for the first time and flashed.
After that, the Descent of the Martial God skill pattern spun one round, and the entire pattern flipped around. The back of the pattern was the God’s Eye skill.
So that was how it was. Mo Xiu finally understood that he indeed had three skills.
God’s Eye and Descent of the Martial God basically occupied the same skill position. The two skills were stuck together with their backs to each other. When one skill was released, it would trigger the passive skill Flip, causing the entire skill to flip to the other skill on the back.
Mo Xiu let out a long sigh. There was no problem with his skills, nor was there any uncertainty.
This way, Mo Xiu, who had two active skills, was a level higher than his peers.
The strength of his skills strengthened Mo Xiu’s determination to become stronger. At that moment, Descent of the Martial God was active. Thus, he started to fight.
After a series of punches, Mo Xiu felt extremely satisfied. On the surface, it seemed like Mo Xiu’s strength had increased by 100% after he activated his skill.
In fact, it was not just that. As Descent of the Martial God provided an improvement in all attributes, including agility, strength, reaction speed, and so on, his overall strength had definitely increased by more than 100%.
After that, Mo Xiu ran at full speed through the forest to train his coordination in this state.
Increasing his attributes was one thing, but whether it could be fully utilized was another. Only when Mo Xiu completely adapted to this amplified state could he unleash the full power of Descent of the Martial God.
This was just like the battle this afternoon, where Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi simultaneously activated their skills and charged towards the Demonic Eagle.
Zheng Yi’s skill only increased his speed by 100%, while Mo Xiu’s skill increased all of his attributes by 100%.
Logically speaking, Mo Xiu should have been faster, but Zheng Yi had reached the Demonic Eagle before Mo Xiu.
This was because this was the first time Mo Xiu had used his skill, and he wasn’t familiar enough with it. Thus, he wasn’t able to unleash its full power.
On the other hand, Zheng Yi’s understanding and proficiency in his skills far exceeded Mo Xiu’s.Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Cosmic Tuition Class
The next morning.
Mo Xiu sat in his seat and listened to Zheng Yi brag.
The entire class surrounded the two of them and asked them about yesterday’s incident.
“Brother Zheng, I heard that you guys defeated an adult beast yesterday?”
Zheng Yi sat at the table with his chin high. “Of course. Didn’t you see how strong your Brother Zheng and Brother Mo were? We easily beat up the Demonic Eagle and made it kneel and beg for mercy.”
Mo Xiu covered his head and didn’t want to continue listening. How was it easy? Zheng Yi had reached the time limit of his skill yesterday. If not for everyone’s support, he might still be lying in the hospital.
Zheng Yi’s speech became more and more intense. It could be said that he had been bragging from the beginning to the end. He said that he had a plan the moment the Demonic Eagle appeared, and that he knew what the Demonic Eagle’s next move would be the moment it appeared.
Initially, Mo Xiu had wanted to ignore him, but he couldn’t stop this fellow from patting Mo Xiu and saying, “Am I right, Mo Xiu?”
Mo Xiu could only brace himself and reply, “Yes, yes, yes, you’re right.”
This passionate speech ended with their form teacher Gao Quan entering the classroom.
Just like before, Gao Quan said some words of encouragement to everyone before letting them go for self-study.
Before he left, he even called Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi. Zheng Yi’s attitude after being called out was as though he was saying, “Look, everything I said is true. Even the teachers have to look for me to understand the situation.”
The two of them followed Gao Quan to his office. After Gao Quan sat down, he pointed to the seats behind them and said, “Have a seat.”
“I called you guys here today to tell you guys that we’ve been investigating for the entire night without any progress. We can’t confirm the origin of the Demonic Eagle.”
Mo Xiu nodded. He and Zheng Yi were involved in this matter, so the school had to tell them the truth.
“Also, the school unanimously decided to praise both of you in front of the whole school. They are also trying their best to help you earn extra points for your college entrance examination.”
At the mention of bonus points for the college entrance examination, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi’s eyes lit up. Zheng Yi couldn’t help but ask, “Teacher, how many points can you give us?”
Gao Quan shook his head and said, “I’m not sure yet, but since I’ve already told you about it, you don’t have to worry.”
Mo Xiu was also a little excited. He had originally thought that it was just an accident, and they would at most be praised by the entire school. He hadn’t expected that there would be such a thing as bonus points for the college entrance examination.
Gao Quan continued, “Also, if there’s any progress in the investigation of the Demonic Eagle incident, I’ll let you know.”
The two of them said simultaneously, “Thank you, Teacher.”
Gao Quan waved his hand and said, “You don’t have to thank me. The two of you fought for all of this.”
“Zheng Yi, you can go back first. Mo Xiu, stay behind.”
Both of them stood up at the same time. When they heard Gao Quan asking Mo Xiu to stay, he sat back down.
Mo Xiu didn’t understand what Gao Quan meant. Why did he want only Mo Xiu to stay behind?
After Zheng Yi left, Gao Quan’s serious expression changed. Then, he said playfully, “Mo Xiu, you’re really something. I didn’t expect to be able to come into contact with someone of Elder Tang’s level.”
Mo Xiu was confused. “Elder Tang?”
Gao Quan leaned back in his chair and said, “Alright, stop pretending. It was Elder Tang who asked me to talk to you. He even recommended that you join the Cosmic Tuition Class. Why are you pretending?”
Mo Xiu was even more puzzled. What was going on?
“Teacher Gao, did you find the wrong person? I don’t know Elder Tang at all, and I’ve never heard of any Cosmic Tuition Class. If this involves confidential information, I won’t tell anyone.”
To Mo Xiu, Gao Quan must have looked for the wrong person. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to not understand anything.
Gao Quan fell silent after hearing what Mo Xiu said, as if he was thinking about something.
“Um… Teacher, can I leave now?”
“Don’t go. I didn’t look for the wrong person. Since you don’t know the details, let me give you an introduction.”
Mo Xiu nodded.
“It doesn’t matter if you know Elder Tang or not. This chance to enter the Cosmic Tuition Class is very rare. I know you must not have heard of the Cosmic Tuition Class, but you must have heard of the Shadows.”
Mo Xiu’s eyes lit up. The Shadows were familiar to everyone. They were part of an organization that belonged to the Alliance but was not restricted by the Alliance. They were something many people yearned for.
The Shadows were like secret enforcers. Usually, they were free to choose whether they would accept missions or not. The Shadows would only be gathered when the Alliance needed them to carry out some important missions. Even so, the Shadows could refuse the missions.
This was equivalent to having status and money, but they also had the freedom of time. As long as one did not want to, it was possible not to accept even a single mission.
“I know about the Shadows. What does this Tuition Class have to do with the Shadows?”
“If you graduate from the Cosmic Tuition Class, there is a high chance that you will directly become a Shadow.”
Mo Xiu was shocked. After all, the selection for Shadows was very strict. Only those who entered university could register for the Shadow selection. Furthermore, the minimum requirement to register was to have two skills.
The Cosmic Tuition Class sounded more like a special training camp before the college entrance examination.
“Teacher, I only have one skill. Can I really become Shadow in advance?”
Gao Quan looked deeply at Mo Xiu and said, “Sure, as long as you can graduate from the Tuition Class successfully.”
“Understood.”
“Are you going to participate?”
“Yes!”
Although it was rather baffling, Mo Xiu didn’t want to let go of this opportunity.
“Alright. Give a call to your family and let them know that you are attending the Tuition Class for ten days, starting from tonight. In other words, you will be away until the day before the college entrance examination.”
“Ah? Is it so sudden?”
Even Mo Xiu couldn’t remain calm. Wasn’t this too hasty? Was he going to leave today and only return the day before the college entrance examination?
“Is there a problem?”
“No! No, but… I have a question.”
“What question?”
“Who is Elder Tang? I don’t know him. Why did he recommend that I attend the Cosmic Tuition Class?”
After a moment of silence, Gao Quan said, “Since he doesn’t want you to know, don’t ask. You’ll meet him sooner or later.”
“I got it. I’ll get going now.”
“Okay, sure. By the way, you can’t tell anyone about this, including your family. Tell everyone that you were sent to another city as an exchange student.”
Mo Xiu increasingly felt that this Cosmic Tuition Tlass was not simple. However, as his form teacher, Gao Quan had no need to lie to him.
“Understood…”
After returning to the classroom, it was lunchtime. Zheng Yi asked Mo Xiu and Gao Quan what Gao Quan had told them.
Mo Xiu also told Zheng Yi what Gao Quan said about being an exchange student.
“Impressive, bro. This is the first time I’ve heard of an exchange student. Which city and school are you going to?”
Mo Xiu gave Zheng Yi a knowing look and replied, “Don’t you know which school I’m going to?”
Zheng Yi hesitated for a moment before saying, “Oh… Yes, I know.”
Mo Xiu had already taken a few steps away, but Zheng Yi was still muttering to himself.
“Which school is it?”
Mo Xiu had said this on purpose. With Zheng Yi’s personality, he would definitely pretend to know and only ask Mo Xiu if he couldn’t think of the answer in the future.
What would Mo Xiu do when Zheng Yi reacted? At that time, Mo Xiu would have gone to the Cosmic Tuition Class.
As the training grounds were undergoing maintenance, there was no way to train in the afternoon, so Mo Xiu could go home and pack his luggage.
After splitting up with Zheng Yi, Mo Xiu had just walked out of the school gates when he was stopped by a girl.
“Hello, Senior Mo. May I disturb you?”
“Who are you?”
“Ah! My name is Ye Qian’er. You saved me yesterday. Thanks to you, I only suffered some light injuries.”
Mo Xiu slapped his head. It turned out that she was the girl who was captured by the Demonic Eagle yesterday. It was no wonder that she looked familiar.
“Why are you looking for me?”
Ye Qian’er placed her hands behind her back and lowered her head, not daring to look at Mo Xiu.
Seeing that Ye Qian’er did not respond, Mo Xiu asked again.
“May I know why you’re looking for me?”
When Ye Qian’er heard Mo Xiu’s words, she seemed to have been jolted awake. Her whole body trembled and she stretched out the hand behind her back.
She was holding a paper bag in her hand, and she hurriedly threw it to Mo Xiu.
“Thank you, senior. This is for you.”
Then, she turned around and ran off…Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

So You Are Elder Tang
Mo Xiu caught the bag that Ye Qian’er had thrown over and smiled awkwardly. What was going on? Was he scary?
Mo Xiu shook his head as he watched Ye Qian’er run away.
On the other side, Ye Qian’er ran behind a tree and hid. Breathing heavily, she used the tree to block her body and looked back.
Then, she covered her face with her hands and squatted down, as if she was too ashamed to face anyone.
“Aiya, how embarrassing. Why am I being so shy when I’m just thanking him?”
…
When Mo Xiu returned home, he cleaned up briefly and packed a few clothes to change into.
He left a note for his mother, informing her that he would not return home for the time being.
Telephone communication was already very convenient, but Mo Xiu still liked to leave a note when communicating with his mother. Perhaps it was because writing it on paper was more realistic.
In the evening, Mo Xiu looked for Gao Quan.
Then, Gao Quan drove Mo Xiu out of the city.
Mo Xiu finally couldn’t help but ask, “Teacher, where are we going? Why are we so far away? We’re almost in no man’s land.”
“Why? Are you afraid that I’ll sell you away?”
“No, no!”
Of course, Mo Xiu wouldn’t suspect anything. Not only did Gao Quan have a high status in the school, even if he wanted to sell his students, he would sell Zheng Yi, that young master. There was no need to sell a poor student like Mo Xiu.
The car traveled until it was completely dark. Mo Xiu was a little hungry. He rummaged through his backpack, but only the paper bag Ye Qian’er gave him seemed to contain food.
He opened it and saw that it was indeed food. It was cookies and looked like it was made by Ye Qian’er. He took out a piece and ate it. It tasted really good.
Gao Quan saw Mo Xiu eating cookies. No matter how he looked at it, the bag looked like it was given by a girl.
“Oh, is that a gift from your girlfriend? I love to eat food that others have made for me.”
As he spoke, he grabbed a cookie and ate it.
“This tastes pretty good. Which lady is this from?”
In Mo Xiu’s memories, Gao Quan had always been a responsible form teacher. Thus, he didn’t expect him to be so casual in private.
“You’re mistaken. The girl who I saved yesterday gave these cookies to me to thank me.”
“Was she Ye Qian’er? She’s a famous beauty. You’re really lucky.”
“Er…”
Mo Xiu almost choked on his words. This was not just casual, but also… disrespectful.
As Gao Quan teased him, the car finally stopped in front of a large courtyard.
Mo Xiu looked at the time. It was already 9 pm, but this didn’t look like a tuition class.
Mo Xiu followed Gao Quan into the courtyard. Two middle-aged men walked towards them.
One of them said, “Is this the person recommended by Elder Tang?”
Gao Quan replied unhappily, “Of course, I’ve already brought him here. How can he be a fake?”
The two middle-aged men chatted with Gao Quan and arranged a room for Mo Xiu.
Even after entering the room and lying on the bed, Mo Xiu was still in disbelief.
Was this simple courtyard the Cosmic Tuition Class that Gao Quan had mentioned? Was this the Tuition Class that would allow one to become a Shadow after graduating?
After a night of silence, Mo Xiu woke up early the next morning to wash up. The water source was the underground water from the well.
He looked more closely at the courtyard and found that there was something odd about it. There was a small circle of rooms with a large and empty field in the middle. The field in the middle was quite large, perhaps even larger than the school field.
Before Mo Xiu could finish washing up, a voice resounded throughout the courtyard.
“Gather in five minutes!”
Mo Xiu looked up and saw two middle-aged men in the middle of the courtyard. Then, he ran over without a word.
He ran to the two of them and stood in front of them. It was too dark last night, so he couldn’t see their faces clearly.
Upon closer inspection, he realized that these two were clearly twins. They looked too similar. The only difference was that one wore glasses while the other did not.
Then, two men ran out from the surrounding houses. One was fat and the other was thin. They looked quite comical when they ran together.
The next person who came out shocked Mo Xiu. She was a woman, a woman Mo Xiu was very familiar with.
She was Mu Qingyi! Why was she here?
After standing in line, the two of them looked at each other and smiled. What a coincidence.
The bespectacled middle-aged man said, “Alright, everyone is here. No one is late. Mo Xiu, step forward!”
Mo Xiu took a step forward upon hearing this.
“You were the first to arrive. From now on, you will be the leader of this team. If the team members make a mistake, you will be punished too.”
When Mo Xiu heard the first half of the sentence, he thought that it was an important task, but when he heard the second half, his expression immediately changed.
Why did it sound like he had to be punished for being the first to report?
“Mo Xiu, did you hear me?”
Mo Xiu quickly replied, “Yes, I got it.”
“Alright, fall back in.”
“Let me introduce myself. My name is Wang Yu. This is my brother, Wang Lei. If you can’t differentiate between the two of us, remember that the one wearing glasses is the younger brother, Wang Yu.”
The four of them were still waiting for Wang Yu’s next order. They did not expect Wang Yu to say something unexpected.
“Okay, you are dismissed. Finish your breakfast before 8 am and come to this classroom. The canteen is the room at the main entrance.”
After saying that, the two brothers returned to their room and left the four of them in the same spot.
What kind of situation was this? One second, it was serious, as if they were going through military training, and the next, they were dismissed as if they were playing around. They didn’t even have a morning exercise!
Seeing that everyone was embarrassed, Mo Xiu took the lead and said, “Everyone, let’s introduce ourselves and get to know one another.”
“I’ll go first. My name is Mo Xiu. I’m a student from Shun City First High School.”
After that, the others started to introduce themselves. The skinny guy, Yue Yuan, and the fatty, Liu Ziyang, were both from Shun City Glory High School.
Mo Xiu had long heard of Glory High School. It was the best elite school in the city. Anyone who could enter that school was not simple.
After a deeper understanding of the situation, Mo Xiu finally understood the nature of this Cosmic Tuition Class. It wasn’t a tuition class at all. It was more like a training camp.
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan’s families had arranged for them to come here to receive training and obtain the qualifications to become Shadows.
After breakfast, they split up. At this moment, Mu Qingyi secretly went to find Mo Xiu.
“Mo Xiu? Why are you here?”
Mo Xiu said, “I wanted to ask you, why are you here?”
Mu Qingyi was a little happy to see Mo Xiu. The previous gathering was organized by Mu Qingyi to bid farewell to her high school friends before going to the Cosmic Tuition Class.
At that time, Mo Xiu did not go to the gathering, and Mu Qingyi was still a bit regretful. However, she did not expect to meet him again here.
Mu Qingyi skipped over to Mo Xiu and said, “I didn’t expect to see you here. Who recommended that you come here?”
Mo Xiu said awkwardly, “I don’t know either. I heard that it was Elder Tang?”
Mu Qingyi widened her eyes and said, “Are you Elder Tang’s disciple? You’re too amazing.”
“No. Actually, I don’t know Old Tang.”
“You don’t know Elder Tang? That’s impossible. With Elder Tang’s status, he wouldn’t recommend you if he didn’t know you. Oh right, he’s usually in our school’s library.”
Mo Xiu came to a sudden realization. It turned out that Elder Tang was the old man in the library who gave him goosebumps. Thinking about the way that old man looked at him, he felt a little nervous.
“So it’s him. We’ve met before. Is he amazing?”
“Of course, he has contributed greatly to the Alliance. During the war…”
Mu Qingyi’s words came to an abrupt halt. She covered her mouth with both hands and stared at Mo Xiu with wide eyes.
“I said something I couldn’t say.”
“It’s okay. I won’t tell anyone.”
“Swear it!”
“I promise I won’t tell anyone.”
“Swear it!”
“I swear that I won’t tell anyone that you, Mu Qingyi, told me about it.”
“You…”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Physique Limit Theory
When Mo Xiu found out that Elder Tang was the old man from the library, he felt like he had been tricked.
After chatting for a while, the four students went to the so-called classroom and sat down. This was an extremely ordinary room.
At the front of the room was a bed and a blackboard. Meanwhile, there were scattered chairs at the back of the classroom.
The few of them quickly tidied up after entering the classroom and arranged the chairs so that the entire classroom did not look as messy.
Just as Mo Xiu was wondering how the teacher would teach with a bed in front of the classroom…
Wang Yu strode into the classroom and sat on the bed. Then, he adjusted his glasses and said, “Not bad, everyone is here.”
Mo Xiu was so shocked that he couldn’t speak. From the name of the Cosmic Training Class, to the classroom and the teacher, everything seemed very casual.
Mo Xiu felt that it was better to stay in school and study. Then, he looked at the other three people and saw that they were all looking at Wang Yu with respect.
Wang Yu coughed and said, “Ahem, let me introduce you to the curriculum of the Cosmic Tuition Class. There are ten days of classes in total. They are divided into the theory classes that I will teach in the morning, and the combat classes that my brother, Wang Lei, will teach in the afternoon.”
“First of all, what is taught in the Tuition Class might not be very useful for your college entrance examination.”
“The main thing is to improve your combat ability. The theory class has nothing to do with the high school curriculum either.”
“Do you have any questions? If not, I’ll start teaching.”
Seeing that no one asked any questions, Wang Yu continued, “Okay, today we will talk about basic knowledge regarding skills.”
Mo Xiu didn’t understand. He had just said that he wasn’t going to talk about high school knowledge. Why was he talking about the basic knowledge regarding skills?
“All of you know the randomness of skill awakening. In that case, do you know what is stable about skill awakening?”
Mo Xiu shook his head, indicating that he wasn’t sure. Meanwhile, the fatty Liu Ziyang, said proudly, “I know. Skills can be inherited.”
Wang Yu added, “That’s right. Skills do not appear randomly. They are inherited. In other words, your parents’ skills are likely to be inherited by you.”
“This is not the only thing that is stable about skills. Skills will also be limited to a general direction based on each person’s physique. I call this the Physique Limit Theory.”
“Physiques are divided into many types. The broadest categories are the warrior physique, the assassin physique, the mage physique, and the assistant investigative physique. Of course, there are also some special categories, but they are relatively rare.”
“For those who have a warrior physique, their awakened skills will mostly consist of basic offensive and defensive skills.”
“For those with an assassin physique, they will mostly awaken agility-type, concealment-type, or high explosion-type skills.”
“As for those with a mage physique, their skills are more inclined towards elemental damage.”
“And so on and so forth. Everyone has their own physique, and the choice of their skills is limited to this range.”
Mo Xiu’s expression was serious. This was not basic knowledge regarding skills. If this theory that he had never heard of before was true, it would cause a sensation among the people. However, why had he never heard of it?
Thus, Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, I have a question. Why haven’t I heard of this theory before?”
Wang Yu adjusted his glasses and said, “It’s strange if you’ve heard it before, because I developed this theory myself.”
Mo Xiu wasn’t the only one who was stunned. When the others heard Wang Yu’s words, they were all dumbfounded. Wasn’t this too much of a joke? He just talked about the theory that he had come up himself just like that!
The skinny Yue Yuan asked, “Teacher, what is the accuracy of your theory?”
Wang Yu did not answer Yue Yuan’s question. Instead, he said directly, “Mo Xiu has a warrior physique, Liu Ziyang has an assassin physique, and Yue Yuan has a mage physique. I can’t determine Mu Qingyi’s physique. Think about what I’ve said, okay?”
Everyone fell silent. Mo Xiu focused his attention on his skill. The active skill was Descent of the Martial God. According to Wang Yu’s theory, it was indeed suitable for someone with a warrior physique.
Seeing that no one said anything, Wang Yu continued, “Let me introduce myself again. I am an intelligence agent from the Shadow Headquarters. My first skill is X-Ray Vision. Don’t misunderstand. This skill allows me to see your basic attributes. My second skill is Integration. I can use this skill to integrate big data into categories. My third skill is Rapid Number Analysis, while my fourth skill is Confidentiality.”
“I have a data-based physique, which means I’m an out-and-out knowledge worker. Many people know about my skills, so there’s no need to keep them a secret. All my theories have some basis.”
Mo Xiu was shocked. These skills weren’t strong, but when combined together with Shadow’s powerful intelligence system, they were simply too powerful.
To exaggerate, the person who was lecturing him was Shadow’s central computer.
Mo Xiu never thought that such a big shot would actually come to lecture him. He had even questioned Wang Yu just now.
After that, Wang Yu talked about a lot of skill knowledge that Mo Xiu had never heard of before. The four of them also picked up a piece of paper and a pen to record the information.
Mo Xiu once again looked forward to the Cosmic Tuition Class. What Wang Yu said might not have any effect on the college entrance examination, but it was very important for his future development.
If he used this knowledge well, it could change the outcome of a battle, or even the direction of a battle.
The lecture lasted the entire morning. Mo Xiu did not relax as he listened to Wang Yu and took notes.
After the entire lesson, he felt extremely content. This was not just a lesson, neither did it simply deepen his understanding of skills. It was an improvement of his entire understanding of the world.
Furthermore, this lesson, which was extremely important to Mo Xiu, was taught by the teacher sitting on the bed in such an ordinary courtyard and a simple classroom.
Perhaps it was because they had been taught differently since they were young, but Mu Qingyi and the other two did not have such deep feelings. They might have been influenced by their family since they were young. Thus, they more or less had some knowledge about skills.
However, from a young age, all of Mo Xiu’s knowledge came from school textbooks, causing Mo Xiu to reflect on Wang Yu’s teachings all afternoon.
There was a combat class in the afternoon. The four of them stood neatly in the middle of the courtyard.
Wang Lei slowly walked towards them and said, “We will start the combat class now. You must understand the importance of the combat class. In ten days’ time, there will be no test for the theory class, only actual combat. So all of you better keep your spirits up.”
“Yes!”
The four of them shouted together.
“Alright, let’s start the lesson now. Today’s lesson content is to fight me. All of you, come at me together.”
Mo Xiu and the others looked at each other. What was going on? Why was he so direct?
Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, aren’t we going to jog to warm up?”
Wang Lei said unhappily, “When you meet an enemy, will they give you time to warm up? Also, I’m not here to train your basic skills. Hurry up and start!”
The four of them had no choice but to brace themselves. Mo Xiu was somewhat vexed. He didn’t even know what his teammates’ skills were like. How could he fight?
As the team leader, Mo Xiu could only take the initiative to attack. His entire body flashed with golden light as he activated Descent of the Martial God and punched Wang Lei’s face.
However, Wang Lei didn’t even move. Instead, his entire body was instantly covered in flames. Even his face was covered in flames.
Mo Xiu’s punch landed solidly on Wang Lei’s face, but Wang Lei did not move at all. On the contrary, Mo Xiu had to take two steps back before he could stabilize himself.
Looking at the burn marks on his hands, he looked at Wang Lei in shock. Even when he used his skill, he could not break through Wang Lei’s defense.
How could they fight this battle???Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!

                    



Combat Class
Mo Xiu wasn’t sure if Wang Yu would discover God’s Eye, so he didn’t dare to use it rashly.
It was just like how his entire body would flash with a golden light when he activated Descent of the Martial God. If he could not see the effect of Wang Yu’s skills when he activated God’s Eyes, that meant that he had been exposed.
Mu Qingyi and the other two saw that Mo Xiu had no intention of continuing to fight after being defeated. Thus, they were all stunned on the spot, not knowing what to do.
Currently, Wang Lei’s entire body was engulfed in flames, making it impossible to see his expression clearly. However, his next action let everyone know that he was angry.
With two large strides, Wang Lei passed by Mo Xiu and arrived before the other three people.
He punched the fatty Liu Ziyang. However, the moment his fist came into contact with Liu Ziyang’s body, Liu Ziyang’s entire body turned illusory.
Wang Lei’s punch actually missed. An afterimage of Liu Ziyang was left behind in his original spot, and he completely disappeared.
Wang Lei immediately turned around and punched again!
The next scene was rather strange. A black shadow appeared behind Wang Lei. Then, the black shadow gradually solidified. When the entire black shadow appeared, Wang Lei’s punch landed on the figure.
That was right! This figure was Liu Ziyang. The skill that Liu Ziyang used just now was similar to the Flash. He left behind an afterimage in the distance and instantly appeared behind Wang Lei.
However, he did not expect Wang Lei to see through him. The strength of this punch was not light, and it directly sent Liu Ziyang flying.
Wang Lei did not stop. He delivered a kick towards Yue Yuan, who immediately retreated upon seeing this scene.
Wang Lei chased after him, but when Wang Lei took a step forward, a circle appeared beneath his feet and a burst of light erupted.
After that, Wang Lei stopped moving. Yue Yuan shouted, “Quick, attack now!”
When Mo Xiu, Liu Ziyang, and Mu Qingyi heard this, they attacked together. Mo Xiu was the closest to Wang Lei, and he directly punched Wang Lei’s back with all his strength.
Meanwhile, the fatty Li Ziyang was not slow either. He took out a dagger from somewhere and stabbed it at Wang Lei’s right arm.
Mu Qingyi stood where she was and threw out a flying dagger that headed straight for Wang Lei’s face.
Wang Lei was attacked from three sides. The three of them reacted extremely quickly and attacked in less than a second.
Wang Lei only paused for a second. After regaining his mobility, he grabbed Liu Ziyang’s wrist and threw him behind him, hitting Mo Xiu.
Then, his left hand went to grab Mu Qingyi’s flying dagger. However, the dagger unexpectedly passed through Wang Lei’s palm and headed straight for his face.
Pa!
The dagger hit Wang Lei but did not cause any damage. Like Mo Xiu’s attack at the start, it did not break Wang Lei’s defense.
After that, the four of them no longer had any strength to resist and were beaten up by Wang Lei. Other than Mu Qingyi who was slightly better off, the other three could be said to be covered in injuries.
Wang Lei retracted his skill and said, “You guys will have your second challenge in three hours.”
Even Mo Xiu was starting to feel despair. How was he supposed to fight this person? He couldn’t even break through his defense, but he had to challenge him a second time in three hours.
Mo Xiu could only gather them together to discuss their battle plan for the next challenge.
“In the battle just now, we didn’t know each other’s skills, so we were a little flustered. In order to better cooperate, we should first learn about each other’s skills.”
“I’ll go first. My skill is called Descent of the Martial God. It can increase all of my attributes.”
Even if Mo Xiu did not mention how much his attributes would increase after activating this skill, Mu Qingyi and the other two were still slightly surprised. They had never heard of a skill that could increase all attributes.
Mu Qingyi was the second to speak. “My technique is Spatial Folding, which can allow me to transport objects. The flying knife just now could pass through Teacher Wang Lei’s palm because I actually used Spatial Folding. Unfortunately, my attack power is too weak, and I couldn’t cause any harm to Teacher Wang Lei.”
Liu Ziyang continued, “My skill is called Afterimage. All of you have seen the effect. It leaves behind an afterimage and allows me to disappear. One second later, I will appear at any spot within a one-meter radius from my original position.”
Yue Yuan said, “My skill is Five Elements Formation. Metal is used to strengthen my attacks, wood is used to stun, water is used to heal, fire is used to damage, and earth is used to strengthen my defense. I can set up a formation on any spot on the ground, but I cannot activate it. Instead, it will activate automatically after two seconds. I used the Wood Formation to temporarily control Teacher Wang Lei just now.”
No one hid the effects of their skill. There was no need to hide it either. After all, their skill would definitely be known in the future battles.
What really needed to be hidden was the duration of the skill, its cooldown time, and other important information. This was because it was easy for others to exploit this information.
Logically speaking, the skills of these few people were variable and they could formulate many strategies with them. However, under Wang Lei’s absolute defense, no one had any good ideas.
During the second challenge, no one had any fighting spirit. When they were faced with an undefeatable opponent, it was a hopeless situation.
As a result, the challenge ended very quickly. The four of them were mostly harassing him. Mo Xiu didn’t even use any skills.
In the end, the four of them were beaten up again and laid on the ground.
Wang Lei’s mood was dampened as he said, “Today’s combat class is over. Tomorrow, you will continue challenging me.”
The four of them helped each other to sit up. Mo Xiu and the others suspected that this combat class was not meant to train them. Instead, Wang Lei simply wanted to torture noobs like them.
At night…
After the four of them had their meal, Yue Yuan used the water formation in the Five Elements Formation to heal everyone.
After that, they went back to their own rooms to rest. After all, they had been beaten up for an entire afternoon and were all very tired.
After returning to his room, Mo Xiu began to summarize what he had learned today. At this moment, his phone rang.
It was a message from Zheng Yi.
“Mo Xiu, you’re such a jerk. You told me that you were going to become an exchange student, but you didn’t say that you would leave so soon. Which school did you go to?”
Mo Xiu replied.
“There are only ten days left until the college entrance examination. Of course I’ll leave immediately as an exchange student.”
“Oh, okay. Which school is it?”
“It’s a school you’d never think of.”
…
On the other side of the courtyard, a heated discussion was taking place in a room.
Wang Lei said to an old man, “Elder Tang, Mo Xiu’s skills are indeed rare. His skill might be able to improve all his attributes, but it’s not enough for you to make an exception and send him to the Cosmic Tuition Class.”
At this moment, Elder Tang was lying on his side on the bed and said angrily, “What do you know? Let me tell you, this kid is not simple. Maybe he has more than one skill. Wang Yu, look at that kid’s attributes today and see if there are any abnormalities.”
Wang Yu thought for a moment. Then, he pushed his glasses up and said, “The basic attributes of his body are not bad. His skills belong to the warrior category. There are no abnormalities.”
“From tomorrow onwards, I’ll give you a mission. Activate your skills to observe Mo Xiu throughout the day.”
…
The next morning, in the classroom.
“The main topic today is about upgrading skills.”
“Before that, let’s talk about what happened yesterday. Did you notice that Wang Lei asked you to rest for three hours before fighting again?”
The four of them nodded.
“In that case, how did Wang Lei determine that your skills could complete their cooldown in three hours?”
That was right. How did Wang Lei know that the cooldown time for all four skills was within three hours?
“The reason is very simple. According to big data analysis, unless the skill is some large-scale killing skill, the cooldown time will be within three hours. This is something that will be covered in university courses. You guys should understand it first.”
“Let’s get back to the main topic. There are two ways to upgrade your skills. One is to train, and the other is to eat.”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!

                    



We Still Want to Fight
“There are two ways to upgrade your skills. One is to train, and the other is to eat.”
“Training refers to training your own skills. Meanwhile, eating refers to eating heavenly treasures. I shouldn’t need to explain too much as you should all know this.”
“Let’s talk about the importance of upgrading your skills and my personal understanding of the situation.”
Mo Xiu understood that Wang Yu’s personal understanding could basically be trusted. However, it was not publicly recognized and printed into textbooks.
“You fellows should have noticed by now. Yesterday, Wang Lei had only used one skill. However, when he fought against you all, it was basically a crushing defeat. That is because his skill level is far above yours.”
Mo Xiu raised his hand and asked, “Teacher, I would like to ask if the skill levels only differ by one level, will there be a huge difference in actual combat?”
Wang Yu gestured for Mo Xiu to put his hand down.
“There is a very large difference. If we ignore the increase in the strength of the skill, the difference of one level is very likely to reduce the cooldown time by half. Can you understand this concept?”
Mo Xiu understood. In a life and death battle, the cooldown time was related to life and death. It was just like when he fought the Demonic Eagle previously. If his skill had entered its cooldown time, the consequences would have been unimaginable.
“In that case, what level is Teacher Wang Lei’s skill at? Even if there’s a difference, it can’t be that big, right?”
After Liu Ziyang asked this question, he realized that he had been a little rude.
Wang Yu didn’t mind and replied, “His skill is at Level-4.”
“Let’s move on. First, let’s talk about training. This is very metaphysical. Some people use their skills every day for eight or ten years, but they might not even be able to level up by one level. Some people might level up their skills after using them a few times. I’ve concluded that training alone is useless. It’s more important to understand your own skills.”
“Then, let’s talk about eating. After ‘The Beginning’ came into being, humans gained four skills, animals gained talent skills, and plants became heavenly treasures. As a result, almost all plants now have an effect, not to mention the herbs that have become priceless treasures.”
“There are many types of herbs. Some of them can directly evolve skills. For example, the Spirit Ring that you are most familiar with can directly upgrade skills from Level-1 to Level-2.”
Mo Xiu was no stranger to these things. There was a herb store in Shun City. He had once entered it and was shocked by the astronomical prices inside.
His mother’s monthly salary was 5,000 yuan, while an ordinary body-strengthening herb cost 50,000 yuan. This was almost his mother’s annual salary.
Hence, Mo Xiu had never thought about herbs. He could only work harder than others in exchange for better physical fitness.
During this lesson, Wang Yu explained a lot about his understanding of skill levels. This was the second time Mo Xiu had attended Wang Yu’s lesson, and he was still shocked and benefited greatly from it.
At noon, the four of them quickly went to the field to discuss their strategy after lunch. This was because they would be beaten up again in the afternoon.
Time flew by and it was already afternoon. Just like yesterday, Wang Lei walked leisurely to the front of the crowd.
“Be…”
Pa!
Before Wang Lei could finish speaking, Mo Xiu had already attacked. His right arm swept out and struck Wang Lei’s right arm.
This time, Mo Xiu did not use any skills. This was because after the first battle yesterday, his skill had been switched to God’s Eye. In the second battle, he did not use any skills.
Thus, if Mo Xiu wanted to use Descent of the Martial God, he could only use God’s Eye once to reverse his skills.
He couldn’t care too much about it now. He hadn’t been discovered even after using God’s Eye twice, so there shouldn’t be any problems.
The moment he hit Wang Lei, Mo Xiu activated his skill, God’s Eye.
“First Skill: Inferno Armor (Can be activated).”
“Skill Effect: Covers the user in flames. Increases defense by 300% and attack by 500% (Additional burn effect).”
“Duration: 30 minutes.”
“Cooldown: One hour.”
He could only see one skill. However, it was impossible for Wang Lei to only have one skill. This meant that there was still room for Mo Xiu to upgrade God’s Eye. Currently, he could only see one skill.
His passive skill, Flip, flashed and his active skill became Descent of the Martial God. Then, Mo Xiu immediately used his skill.
Another punch was thrown out. At this moment, Wang Lei reacted and immediately activated Inferno Armor.
Mo Xiu’s punch landed on the flames, causing Wang Lei’s feet to retreat slightly.
This time, the way Wang Lei looked at Mo Xiu changed. Mo Xiu threw another punch at Wang Lei. Wang Lei did not take it head on but dodged to the side.
Mo Xiu didn’t have any secret moves. It was just that he didn’t use his full strength when he saw Wang Lei covered in flames yesterday to prevent himself from getting injured.
However, today, the first thing he did was to fight with all his might regardless of whether he was injured or not.
While Mo Xiu and Wang Lei were exchanging blows, the other three were not idle either. Mu Qingyi found a good angle to throw flying daggers. Although they could not break through Wang Lei’s defense, they could at least cause some interference.
Sure enough, as Mo Xiu expected, Mu Qingyi’s daggers only made Wang Lei dodge slightly. They did not have any substantial effect.
At the same time, Liu Ziyang went behind Wang Lei and prepared to launch a sneak attack. Wang Lei swung his hand back and hit an afterimage. Liu Ziyang had activated his skill.
Wang Lei thought that Liu Ziyang would appear beside him and attack him from both sides with Mo Xiu. Thus, he held back when attacking Mo Xiu.
However, when Liu Ziyang appeared again, he was still behind Wang Lei. He only retreated by a meter.
Only then did Wang Lei realize that he had been tricked. He immediately attacked Mo Xiu.
However, it was too late. A golden light flashed beneath Mo Xiu’s feet. Yue Yuan’s metal array had already been activated, increasing Mo Xiu’s attack power.
Mo Xiu felt that his strength had increased by about 20%. This was an increase of 20% after using Descent of the Martial God. Thus, the increase was quite impressive.
However, fighting against Wang Lei was still very strenuous. In terms of actual combat experience, there was still a huge gap between them, let alone the difference in strength.
Mo Xiu took a step back as Wang Lei took a step forward and stood at Mo Xiu’s original position.
Then, something unexpected happened. Two beams of light shot out from beneath Wang Lei’s feet. It was Yue Yuan’s fire array and wood array. The fire array attacked Wang Lei first.
This time, the attack only caused Wang Lei to pause for a moment, and did not cause any damage. However, the wood array that was triggered immediately caused Wang Lei to freeze in place.
Mo Xiu’s legs bent, and he twisted his waist into a terrifying angle to accumulate power. Then, he punched out.
The Bow Fist was the most powerful attack that Mo Xiu knew. Whether or not they would succeed in this challenge depended on this move.
“Bang!!!”
This punch landed on Wang Lei’s lower abdomen, causing him to take a step back, but it was only a single step.
Then, Wang Lei stabilized his body. Even if the four of them rushed forward, they would not have the chance to fight back.
The opportunity had already appeared, but they were still unable to defeat Wang Lei. The disparity between them was simply too great.
After knocking all four of them to the ground, Wang Lei clapped his hands and said, “Not bad, not bad. You actually came up with such a feasible plan. You are still using Mo Xiu as the main attacker. However, their teamwork is clearly better than yesterday.”
“Mu Qingyi and Liu Ziyang’s attacks were all fake. The goal was to let Yue Yuan enhance Mo Xiu’s strength and set up a trap for me. There was a very clever point. Yue Yuan placed three array formations under Mo Xiu’s feet consecutively. After he finished enhancing Mo Xiu’s strength, he triggered the other two array formations one second after the other, allowing me to step on them without any doubt.”
“Not a bad strategy. Who designed the strategy?”
The other three looked at Mo Xiu.
Wang Lei said, “You’re a pretty good leader.”
Mo Xiu said directly, “Teacher, we still want to fight!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

The First Lesson
“We still want to fight!”
Not only did Mo Xiu say this, but Mu Qingyi, Yue Yuan, and Liu Ziyang also looked at Wang Lei with battle intent in their eyes.
Wang Lei smiled and said, “Not bad. The first lesson is over.”
Mo Xiu and the others were puzzled. The first lesson was over?
Wang Lei’s voice sounded again.
“The first lesson is to become unyielding. Yesterday, you gave up on the second challenge, but today, you took the initiative to challenge me. You are clearly facing an invincible enemy, but you made different choices.”
“When facing enemies who are many times stronger than you, choosing to not give up is the first lesson. During the great war, when humans faced the powerful Beast Emperors whose skills have no cooldown, they were even more desperate than you. However, that generation did not give up. In order to protect their home and family, they chose to fight.”
“That battle caused rivers of blood to flow and corpses to cover the ground. That battle was the greatest calamity in human history. However, it was also the most glorious battle for mankind. That battle protected the homeland of mankind. There was hope left in that battle.”
“Although I’m not your enemy, I want to teach you that when you have nowhere to retreat on the battlefield, you should bring out your fighting spirit. So what if the enemy is strong? When people stimulate their potential, it’s enough to create miracles, right?”
Wang Lei’s words made Mo Xiu and the other three feel emotional. Although they hadn’t personally witnessed that war, the only reason they could live peacefully now was because of that war.
Thus, Mo Xiu was no stranger to that war. Wang Lei was right. When facing an enemy, one had to maintain their fighting spirit.
“Alright, we’ll rest for the rest of the day. The individual battles will begin tomorrow.”
Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, what does the individual battle mean?”
“That means that the four of you will fight each other in a one-on-one battle.”
Mo Xiu and the others were stunned. Was there such a thing?
After the combat class ended, Yue Yuan healed everyone and left. Tomorrow was the individual battle, so everyone had to be prepared.
Mo Xiu was no exception. After returning to his room, he organized his notes and analyzed how he should fight the others.
After dinner, Mo Xiu walked out of the courtyard alone and started punching a large rock.
Having been here for two days without any basic training or boxing, Mo Xiu felt that it was best not to fall behind.
However, before he could finish his set of punches, he heard bell-like laughter behind him.
“Hehehe, Mo Xiu, aren’t you working too hard?”
Mo Xiu turned around. Who else could it be but Mu Qingyi?
“Same to you. I’m just a poor kid who’s trying very hard to make a name for myself. It’s rare and precious for a young lady like you to work so hard.”
Upon hearing Mo Xiu’s words, Mu Qingyi suddenly lowered her head in sadness.
Mo Xiu did not know Mu Qingyi very well, and had never seen her like this.
When they were in school, both of them would train until the school closed. They would leave together many times, but they were not that close.
The two of them simply walked together and greeted each other briefly. When they walked out of the school gate, Mu Qingyi would be picked up by the car that had been waiting at the gate for a long time.
However, even so, Mu Qingyi was the girl Mo Xiu had the closest relationship with in high school.
Mu Qingyi did not speak, and Mo Xiu did not know what to do. He did not know if he should say anything or leave her like this.
Mu Qingyi jumped onto the big rock and sat on it without caring if the rock was dirty or not.
The rock was rather tall. As a result, when Mu Qingyi sat on the edge of the rock, her feet did not touch the ground. Her feet swung in the air just like that.
Then, she turned around and smiled brightly. “Shall we sit for a while?”
Mo Xiu was not infatuated, but he was still mesmerized by the elegant Mu Qingyi before him.
“What’s wrong? Is a man like you afraid of a little girl like me?”
Mo Xiu regained his senses and walked straight to Mu Qingyi’s side to sit down.
“Of course I’m afraid of you. Which man isn’t afraid of a woman, let alone a beautiful woman like you?”
Mu Qingyi giggled.
“Hahaha, I didn’t expect a blockhead like you to be so eloquent.”
Mo Xiu smiled and looked ahead without saying anything. He was sitting under the moonlight, with a light breeze blowing through the air and a beauty beside him. Who wouldn’t yearn for such a comfortable life?
Just like that, the two of them sat there quietly, neither speaking nor appearing awkward. It was as if the two of them were supposed to be watching the night scenery.
“It’s very comfortable being with you.”
The two of them spoke at the same time and smiled at each other.
Mu Qingyi brushed her hair that was blown down by the breeze and said, “I’m not trying hard because I want to, but it’s because I don’t want to go home.”
“Oh.”
Mo Xiu acknowledged and did not say anything else. This was because Mo Xiu knew that what Mu Qingyi needed the most right now was someone to listen to her.
“My parents wanted me to learn all sorts of knowledge related to skills. They hired specialized teachers to teach me actual combat. They also wanted me to make friends with people that they wanted me to make friends with. Every day, I didn’t have the time to think about certain things or do certain things.”
“Oh.”
“I’m under strict orders from them every day at school. I’m not allowed to make personal friends. I have to go home after school and engage in social engagement during meals. I don’t have a minute that I can control.”
“Oh.”
“Slowly, I felt like I was no longer who I am. Everything about me has been arranged. Maybe that knowledge is important. Maybe I’ll use what my teacher taught me in the future. Maybe the people I make friends with are amazing. But I want to be who I am. I want to make friends at school and go out for a meal after school.”
“Oh.”
“What I wanted was that simple, but I couldn’t get it, so I started training hard. I didn’t go home after school, and I trained until school closed because I felt that I could only break free of these when I was training alone. Only then could I think about some things quietly.”
“Oh.”
“I want to slow down, make life slow down, and enjoy every bit of it.”
“Oh.”
“Mo Xiu.”
“Yes, I’m listening.”
“Do you think I’m wrong? Am I wrong in this powerful era?”
“You can say that you’re wrong. You can also say that this world is wrong.”
“Then who do you think is wrong?”
“This world is wrong!”
Mu Qingyi covered her mouth and laughed lightly. “Hehehe, then what should we do if this world is wrong?”
Mo Xiu looked at Mu Qingyi seriously and said, “Then, we should change this world!”
Mu Qingyi was a little moved when she heard Mo Xiu’s words. She knew that what Mo Xiu said was impossible, and she also knew that he was only saying this to comfort her.
However, Mu Qingyi was still very grateful to Mo Xiu. He had said the words in her heart for the first time. She had even obtained approval from him.
Mu Qingyi leaned towards Mo Xiu.
“Mo Xiu, Mu Qingyi, you guys are here too!”
At some point in time, Liu Ziyang came to the courtyard and saw the two of them.
Mu Qingyi had originally wanted to lean against Mo Xiu’s head, but she immediately pulled her body back. She sat up straight and lowered her head to wipe her tears.
“Mo Xiu, it’s getting late. Go back and rest. It’s been a pleasant day. Thank you.”
Mo Xiu jumped off the rock and said, “I appreciate it too.”
Mu Qingyi was comforted, but so was Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu had been tense all these years, and he had never relaxed.
Just now, he had felt an unprecedented sense of relief. The phrase “change the world” was not a joke. At that moment, Mo Xiu really wanted to change the world.
The two of them walked side by side. When they walked past Liu Ziyang, they pretended that he didn’t exist and walked straight back to their room.
Liu Ziyang scratched his head and muttered, “What’s wrong with these two people? Don’t tell me that they’re sleepwalking?”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

The Current State of Humanity
In the teachers’ room in the courtyard…
Wang Yu frowned and said, “Elder Tang, Mo Xiu is indeed a little strange.”
Elder Tang, who was lying on the bed, immediately sat up when he heard this.
“Tell me, tell me!”
“In class this morning, when I used my X-Ray Vision to observe Mo Xiu, I discovered that his skill type was actually more of a detection-type skill. However, when he fought with Wang Lei in the afternoon, I could clearly see that when Mo Xiu used his skill, he was more of a warrior for a moment before returning to a detection-type skill.”
Elder Tang stroked his beard as he lowered his head and said, “Interesting, interesting. Back in school, when I saw that he was familiar with the Demonic Eagle’s weakness, I knew that he wasn’t simple. He might have two skills.”
Wang Yu added, “But this doesn’t mean anything. My X-Ray Vision isn’t that accurate when determining the type of a skill. When I look at Wang Lei, there are times when his skill seems like an assassin-type skill.”
Old Tang nodded and said, “It’s okay. Five it a try tomorrow. You can say this tomorrow…”
The next morning.
“Today, I want to talk about the current state of humanity.”
“You might want to ask, do we still need to talk about the current state of humanity? It’s like this now, because your generation hasn’t come into contact with the previous world.”
“This continent used to be Asia. During the war, the three superpowers formed an alliance, which is the current Human Alliance.”
“After the war, humans and wild beasts signed a contract to be exempted from war. Humans live in the central area of the continent, while wild beasts live on the periphery.”
“The high-tech weapons used by humans have basically disappeared. The reason for their disappearance is that they have limited killing power against wild beasts, but they are very harmful to humans. Thus, they were sealed to prevent civil war from happening.”
Liu Ziyang asked, “Teacher, I heard that we humans used to have a weapon called a nuclear bomb that could render an island lifeless. Is it useless against wild beasts?”
“It works, but it does more harm than good. In the early days of the war, humans used nuclear bombs. However, damage would only be caused at the center of the explosion. Meanwhile, the radiation generated by the explosion would cause the beasts to evolve a second time.”
“There’s another reason, and that is riot. After the war, there were a lot of riots. In order to quell the riots, all weapons were banned.”
Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, humans have better inland resources compared to the beasts. Why didn’t we expand outwards all these years?”
Wang Yu replied, “Humans have abundant resources, but we are essentially sealed off.”
“You may not know this, but there are a total of five continents on Earth. Before the war, the five continents were interconnected. But now, humans have not been able to leave the territory of the Alliance.”
“There’s another reason why I said that we have been sealed off. It’s because there’s no news. You might ask, everyone has a cell phone now, and there is also a lot of news on the Internet. Why is there no news?”
“This is because the news from the other four continents has been cut off. Thus, we have no way of knowing what is happening outside the territory of the Alliance. We don’t even know if the other continents still exist.”
Mo Xiu frowned and asked, “Teacher, can our cell phone signals be blocked? Also, I read that the aerospace industry was developing well before the war. Humans have many artificial satellites too. Can’t we know what’s happening outside?”
Wang Yu smiled bitterly and said, “The strongest people on this planet are not humans or beasts, but the terrifying Sea Race.”
Mo Xiu was familiar with the Sea Race. According to the textbooks, the origin of all the meteorites was in the hands of the Sea Race.
“A large part of the reason the beasts reconciled with us was because the Sea Race was too dangerous.”
“Do you know how big the Pacific Ocean is?”
The four of them shook their heads.
“The Pacific Ocean occupies a third of the Earth. Furthermore, before the war, humans only explored less than five percent of the Pacific Ocean. At that point, we didn’t know what kind of horrible creatures existed in the deep sea. Now, we’re even more afraid to imagine how terrifying those deep-sea creatures would become after being exposed to radiation.”
“The Sea Race destroyed our artificial satellites and blocked our communication signals with their ultrasonic waves. This is the tyrannical method of the Sea Race.”
“Students, don’t be deceived by the peace you see in front of you. This is the result of the hard work of our predecessors. Peace will not last forever. This world is too big, so big that we cannot imagine it.”
Mo Xiu admired Wang Yu from the bottom of his heart. Every lesson provided him with a new understanding of the world.
If his explanation of skills over the past two days could improve Mo Xiu’s understanding, then his explanation of the human situation today widened Mo Xiu’s horizons.
There was very little to talk about today. There was only a bit of content, but there were many questions. The four of them kept asking Wang Yu to explain what the world was like.
Mo Xiu looked towards Mu Qingyi. Yesterday, he had told this woman that he wanted to change the world. Was he too naive?
It was unknown when Mu Qingyi had looked towards Mo Xiu as well. The corners of her lips curled up into a sweet smile.
How wonderful was that? At this moment, Mo Xiu actually felt that it wasn’t impossible to change the world. This was for the sake of his family and friends, so that they could live a stable life, and for the sake of maintaining such a beautiful life.
…
In the afternoon, in the courtyard.
Wang Lei and Wang Yu took out two chairs and sat on them.
Wang Yu said, “In the future, I will watch the battles every day. I will explain to you the rules of today’s individual battle.”
“You will split into two groups. Wang Lei will choose your groups for the individual battle. There is only one condition to decide victory — when either side loses consciousness or admits defeat.”
The corners of Mo Xiu’s mouth twitched. Wasn’t this rule too simple and crude? There were no restrictions, and the conditions for victory were so cruel.
Wang Lei looked at the four of them and said, “Next is the grouping. The first group will be Liu Ziyang against Yue Yuan, and the second group will be Mo Xiu against Mu Qingyi.”
Mo Xiu frowned. After making the calculations last night, he obtained the results. Mu Qingyi was the hardest to deal with.
Mu Qingyi’s attack power was insufficient, but that was when she was attacking Wang Lei. If she were to fight against Mo Xiu and the other two, the power of her flying daggers would not be small.
Coupled with her ever-changing Spatial Folding technique, she was definitely the most difficult to deal with among them.
“First group, get ready!”
Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi retreated to the side to watch the battle. Then, Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan entered the arena, and the two pulled away from each other.
“Get ready… Begin!”
An array appeared beneath Yue Yuan’s feet. The yellow color meant that it was an earth array. Yue Yuan first increased his own defense.
Liu Ziyang said to Wang Lei and Wang Yu unhappily, “Teachers, he cheated. He released his skills before the competition started.”
Yue Yuan’s skill would automatically activate two seconds after it was used. Everyone knew this. The fact that he had enhanced his attributes right after the start of the battle meant that Yue Yuan had released his skill in advance.
Wang Yu shrugged and said, “Didn’t you hear my rules? There are no restrictions. It doesn’t matter even if he dug a trap last night.”
Liu Ziyang looked at the two teachers with his mouth agape. Yue Yuan would not let go of this opportunity. While Liu Ziyang’s attention was not on him, he ran over and started a melee battle.
Liu Ziyang saw that Yue Yuan not only acted shamelessly but also launched a sneak attack. He gritted his teeth in anger and dodged Yue Yuan’s attack.
Mo Xiu had never understood how Liu Ziyang, who was so fat, had the physique of an assassin.
Furthermore, judging from the usual battles, he wasn’t slow either. He might even be faster than Mo Xiu, when Mo Xiu did not activate his skills.
Melee combat wasn’t their forte, but Liu Ziyang still had the advantage of speed.
He struck Yue Yuan many times. However, with the support of the array, Yue Yuan did not suffer any serious injuries.
Neither of them wanted to use their skills first. They both knew that whoever used their skills first would lose.
Just like that, this battle became a protracted battle…Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

The Terrifying Mu Qingyi
Unknowingly, the two of them had been fighting for more than 20 minutes, but there was still no winner.
In terms of endurance, Yue Yuan was better. After all, Liu Ziyang was too heavy.
Slowly, Liu Ziyang stopped dodging and moving like he did in the beginning. Instead, his footsteps became slower and slower. In the end, he barely moved and relied on the flexibility of his hands to hold on.
When Liu Ziyang stopped moving, Yue Yuan knew that his chance had come.
Suddenly, an array appeared under Liu Ziyang’s feet with a flash of fire. It was a fire array!
The moment the fire array erupted, Liu Ziyang turned into a shadow and appeared on Yue Yuan’s left in the next second.
Liu Ziyang held a dagger and felt that victory was in sight. However, unexpectedly, three consecutive rays of light appeared under his feet.
The first was the wood array, which controlled Liu Ziyang. The next two were fire arrays, which dealtz two waves of damage to Liu Ziyang.
Liu Ziyang was already exhausted. Thus, the damage from the two fire arrays caused him to lose his combat ability.
Liu Ziyang simply laid on the ground and shouted, “I admit defeat.”
Wang Yu announced the results.
“Yue Yuan is the winner!”
Liu Ziyang forced himself to sit up and said, “I don’t understand how you knew that I would appear there and set up the array beforehand.”
Yue Yuan said, “As an array master, I’m proficient in setting up traps. You didn’t have any stamina then. When I released the fire array, you would definitely use your skill.”
“The key is where you will appear again after using the skill. If your stamina is insufficient, you will definitely not let go of the opportunity after using the skill.”
“There are three places you can go, namely behind me and on both sides of me. However, you knew that I would be most wary of my back, while my right is where my dominant hand is. Thus, I gambled that you would appear on my left. One second after I placed the first fire array, you appeared. At that time, I set up three array formations on my left in succession.”
Liu Ziyang pouted and said, “How f*cking sinister. He’s even more sinister than an assassin like me.”
Yue Yuan’s skill was more suitable in a team setting. He didn’t have any advantage in the individual battle, but actually used schemes to win.
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but take another look at Yue Yuan. In the previous battle with Wang Lei, it had always been Mo Xiu who had arranged the battle tactics. He didn’t expect Yue Yuan to have such strong analytical abilities.
Although Mo Xiu did not know how many times Yue Yuan could set up the array, he guessed that there was a limit to how many times he could set it up.
In reality, after Yue Yuan activated his skill, no matter what kind of array he used, he could only set up five arrays before entering a state of cooldown.
Although Liu Ziyang did not say it explicitly, everyone could tell that Liu Ziyang’s speed would increase after he released his afterimage. Therefore, Yue Yuan could only gamble this time.
While everyone was still reminiscing about this battle, Wang Yu had already announced the next battle.
Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi arrived at the scene. At this moment, Mo Xiu’s skill was still God’s Eye. Thus, he immediately used it on Mu Qingyi.
“First Skill: Spatial Folding.”
“Skill Effect: (1) Flash: Affects the user. Allows the user to teleport. (2) Object Control: Affects objects. Can cause objects to move twice in three seconds.
“Cooldown: Five seconds (When Object Control is activated, the second movement of an object will not be subject to cooldown).”
For the first time, Mo Xiu had doubts about God’s Eye. It was already terrifying enough that she could teleport, but the cooldown time was only five seconds?
In other words, if Mo Xiao wanted to win, he could only dodge Mu Qingyi’s two teleporting daggers and then defeat her within five seconds.
“Get ready… Begin!”
Mo Xiu did not hesitate and instantly activated Descent of the Martial God. Then, he closed the distance between him and Mu Qingyi at full speed.
Mo Xiu understood that Mu Qingyi used long-range attacks. Thus, the shorter the distance between the two, the greater his chance of victory.
Mu Qingyi stood where she was. She took out a flying dagger from her waist with her right hand and threw it out lightly.
The moment the flying dagger left her hand, it burst through the air at a shocking speed. Mo Xiu knew that the flying dagger was definitely not as simple as it seemed.
Mu Qingyi must have used some sort of special method to exert force when she was throwing the dagger. The dagger looked very light, but in reality, it was moving very quickly.
The flying dagger headed straight for Mo Xiu’s forehead. Mo Xiu originally did not want to dodge, but Mu Qingyi would definitely change the direction of the flying dagger.
However, as the flying dagger approached him, Mo Xiu had no choice but to slow down and dodge.
As Mo Xiu slowed down, the flying dagger disappeared. Mo Xiu didn’t dare to advance rashly and could only search for the flying dagger.
Then, Mo Xiu turned around and realized that the flying dagger was flying towards him from behind.
Mo Xiu frowned. Why did she move the flying dagger so far away? She should have let the flying dagger appear closer to him so that he would be caught off guard.
Mo Xiu stared at the flying dagger. When the flying dagger approached him, he dodged to the side and prepared to grab it with his hands.
However, the flying dagger disappeared once again. This time, it only moved a short distance away from its original position and appeared right in front of Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu couldn’t dodge in time and could only lie down, barely dodging the attack.
At this moment, Mo Xiu was lying on the ground, looking extremely pathetic.
Mu Qingyi’s skill was too troublesome. If Mo Xiu did not know her skill, he might have already been injured.
Mo Xiu, who stood up, suddenly thought of something and looked towards Mu Qingyi.
Mo Xiu thought to himself, “Oh no, I’ve been tricked!” When Mu Qingyi activated Object Control and used it for the first time, the skill would enter a cooldown period. At this point, more than five seconds had passed. This meant that her skill had been refreshed and could be used again.
So that was the case. Mo Xiu was enlightened. She had moved the flying dagger further away just now to buy more time to activate the second displacement.
Before Mo Xiu could prepare himself, Mu Qingyi threw out a second flying dagger.
Mo Xiu already knew Mu Qingyi’s strategy. By utilizing the three second interval between the two displacements, he could almost use his skills indefinitely.
Mo Xiu would no longer give Mu Qingyi the chance to exhaust him and stall for time.
Ignoring the incoming flying daggers, he directly ran towards Mu Qingyi.
This time, when the flying dagger approached Mo Xiu, Mo Xiu did not slow down. He only tilted his head and the flying dagger went right past his face.
Mo Xiu silently counted down in his heart as the flying dagger disappeared and began to move. He started to calculate the cooldown time for Mu Qingyi’s skill.
Five…
This time, the flying dagger appeared behind Mo Xiu, but it wasn’t that far away. It was just a short distance away.
Mo Xiu glanced back and continued accelerating, preparing to race against the flying dagger.
Four…
Mo Xiu was not as fast as the flying dagger. The flying dagger approached him.
Then, Mo Xiu did something that no one expected. He quickly rolled on the ground to reduce his speed as much as possible while dodging the flying dagger.
Three…
The flying dagger disappeared once more and moved again. Right now, Mo Xiu was only a step away from My Qingyi.
Mu Qingyi was currently controlling the flying dagger to perform a second displacement. Thus, she was unable to divert her attention to dodge.
Two…
Mu Qingyi was within reach, but at that moment, the flying dagger had also appeared in front of Mo Xiu’s chest.
In Mu Qingyi’s opinion, it did not matter even if she could not avoid Mo Xiu’s attack. After all, this time, the flying dagger was aimed at Mo Xiu’s heart. Thus, Mo Xiu would definitely dodge it.
One…
As the flying knife flew past, Mo Xiu’s fist flew towards Mu Qingyi and stopped a centimeter away from her face. The wind from his fist blew Mu Qingyi’s hair away.
After a second of silence, Mu Qingyi said, “I lost.”
Mo Xiu had indeed dodged the flying dagger, but he had dodged it in a very strange manner.
He crossed his legs and his entire body was tilted sideways, like a crab.
The flying dagger brushed past Mo Xiu’s chest and cut open his clothes.
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “You held back. Otherwise, the outcome would have been hard to predict.”
Mu Qingyi had indeed held back during the last displacement, giving Mo Xiu time to dodge.
Mo Xiu knew that even if he did not hold back, he would still win. However, he would be severely injured.
Off the battlefield, Wang Lei and Wang Yu looked at each other in shock.
How did he manage to dodge the two extreme attacks? How did he manage to move sideways like a crab?
This was unbelievable. Right now, both of them only had one thought in their minds.
Mo Xiu was a natural warrior…Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Natural Warrior
This battle was deliberately arranged by Wang Lei and Wang Yi. After all, Mu Qingyi and Mo Xiu were the closest in terms of their individual strength.
Mu Qingyi would slightly restrain Mo Xiu, who did not have any long-range attacks. According to their deductions, Mu Qingyi would win with a slight advantage.
However, the outcome of this battle wasn’t just unexpected. During the battle, Mo Xiu’s decisiveness and extreme maneuvering were equally astonishing.
For a moment, there was silence.
“Mo Xiu wins! Today’s combat class ends here.”
Wang Lei’s voice broke the silence. Then, Mo Xiu and the rest headed to their own rooms.
Wang Lei said, “Wang Yu, what is your recent research project?”
Wang Yu adjusted his glasses and stared intently at Mo Xiu’s back.
“Recently, I’ve been researching the conditions and other patterns involved in the awakening of two skills.”
Their voices weren’t soft, and Mo Xiu heard their conversation clearly.
When he heard about the other forms involved in the awakening of two skills, his heart tightened. Could it be that his possession of two skills had been discovered? After all, this was his greatest secret.
Mo Xiu suppressed his emotions and returned to his room.
Wang Lei and Wang Lei also returned to their room.
The moment they entered their room, Wang Yu said, “Elder Tang, Mo Xiu did not react to what I said.”
Elder Tang stroked his beard and said, “I saw it. This child is not simple. Regardless of whether he has a second skill or not, he is a rare talent.”
At this moment, Wang Lei interjected, “Mo Xiu’s improvisation in the battle just now was too shocking. Even I wouldn’t be able to react in that extreme situation.”
Elder Tang nodded and said, “Yes, Mo Xiu’s strength does not solely come from his hard work. He is a genius. He’s born to be a warrior.”
…
Mo Xiu, who had returned to his room, sat down on the bed in a panic.
“Have I been discovered? Does God’s Eye really have a trigger effect that I don’t know about?”
After some serious thought, Mo Xiu slowly calmed down.
If he was really discovered, there was no need for Wang Yu to test him. He could simply talk to Mo Xiu.
His conversation with Wang Lei was either a coincidence or an attempt at probing.
It was very likely that he was being probed. If anyone was probing him, then it must be Elder Tang.
Elder Tang must have other motives for giving him such a great opportunity and bringing him to the Cosmic Tuition Class for no reason.
“That’s not right. If the Wang brothers said that it was arranged by Elder Tang, then Elder Tang is…”
…
Wang Lei, Wang Yu, and Elder Tang were talking when someone suddenly knocked on the door.
Knock, knock, knock!
Wang Yu frowned. Who could it be at this time?
“Who is it?”
“I am Mo Xiu, and I would like to ask you some questions. Is it convenient for you, Teacher?”
Wang Yu looked at Elder Tang, who did not say anything. Then, he stood up and walked out of the small door.
Wang Yu opened the door and Mo Xiu simply squeezed in.
“Teacher, I have some questions that I can’t figure out. I would like to ask you.”
Wang Yu gestured for Mo Xiu to sit down before speaking any further.
Mo Xiu observed the room. It was very large and had four beds. There were also tables and chairs.
Wang Yu also sat down and said, “If you have any questions, just ask.”
After Mo Xiu sat down, he said respectfully, “Why is there a difference in the strength of people’s skills? Previously, you said that everyone’s skills have their uses. However, I’ve seen many useless skills, such as increasing your strength by 5% or understanding the language of pheasants.”
Wang Yu replied, “Not everyone can get into a university, but they can have strong abilities. Some people’s skills are more suitable for production. It might be useless to increase their strength by 5% in battle, but it might be very useful in labor. It’s precisely because of these ordinary and selfless people that we can have a better training environment.”
Mo Xiu looked enlightened and said, “Teacher, I have other questions…”
After that, Mo Xiu asked a bunch of irrelevant questions before pretending that he had benefited greatly.
As soon as Mo Xiu left, Elder Tang came in from the back door and sat at the seat Mo Xiu had been sitting at.
“Hahaha, Mo Xiu is interesting. I was the one probing him, but now he’s probing us.”
Wang Yu nodded and said, “Elder Tang, this child, Mo Xiu, is not simple. He must have noticed something. The moment he entered, he observed the layout of the room.”
“When he asked his questions just now, although he did it very discreetly, I could still tell that he was carefully observing every detail in the room. After asking a few questions, he would take a look at other locations.”
At the side, Wang Lei also said, “I could see it too. He clearly saw through our attempt at probing and came specifically to find us.”
Not only did Mo Xiu’s actions not make Elder Tang angry, Elder Tang even smiled smugly.
“Hahaha, this little fellow is interesting. Since I’ve been discovered, I’ll leave.”
Wang Yu asked, “Elder Tang, do you need us to continue testing Mo Xiu after you leave?”
“There’s no need. Your mission has changed. Not only must you not probe him, you must also help him protect his own secrets.”
Wang Lei and Wang Yu looked at each other. What was the meaning of this? Didn’t Elder Tang get Mo Xiu into the Cosmic Tuition Class to find out Mo Xiu’s secret?
Then, Elder Tang’s next sentence completely shocked the two of them.
“You can say that Mo Xiu is my disciple to outsiders. Hahaha, I finally have a successor.”
Mo Xiu did not know what happened after that. After returning to his room, he felt that his guess was correct.
Elder Tang was at the Cosmic Tuition Class. Furthermore, he was staying in the teachers’ room.
Mo Xiu had taken a closer look at the room earlier and found that there were only Wang Lei and Wang Yu in the room. However, there were obvious signs of habitation on three beds, which meant that one more person was staying there.
Mo Xiu was still preparing for the battle of wits and courage with Elder Tang in the future. Little did he know that Elder Tang had already left the Cosmic Tuition Class.
…
The next morning was also the fourth day since Mo Xiu arrived.
Just like the past few days, Wang Yu arrived at the classroom on time.
“The original plan was to give you a detailed explanation of wild beasts today, but after much consideration, I decided not to. You don’t need this knowledge now, and telling you will only increase the pressure on you.”
“Today’s last lesson has no content. It’s simply a question and answer session. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. As long as it’s something that I know, I will tell you anything that I understand.”
Although there was no theory class today, the entire morning was not wasted. Everyone kept asking questions.
In particular, Mo Xiu had the most questions. Mo Xiu knew that he had the least knowledge and didn’t want to waste this opportunity. Therefore, he would ask any questions he had.
After class, Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, you said today is the last lesson, so what should we do in the morning after today?”
Wang Yu smiled mischievously and said, “I told you on the first day that the primary task of the tuition class is to improve your combat ability. From tomorrow onwards, you will attend the combat class for the entire day.”
They were a little troubled. It was not that they did not want to take the combat class. After all, the combat class was very beneficial to everyone, but it also consumed a lot of energy.
A few days ago, the combat class in the afternoon had made everyone tired. In the future, the combat class would last a whole day. It seemed like everyone would have a hard time.
In the afternoon, the four of them stood together and waited for Wang Lei and Wang Yu’s orders.
The two of them sat on the chairs and whispered to each other.
Liu Ziyang might not be convinced of his defeat yesterday. Thus, he volunteered to say, “Teacher, who am I going to fight today?”
Wang Lei said unhappily, “Who are you going to fight? Did I say that there will be individual battles today?”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

The Second Lesson
???
Mo Xiu was also a little confused. The first individual battle had just taken place yesterday. Logically speaking, everyone should fight against each other once.
However, Mo Xiu had forgotten that common sense did not exist after coming to the Cosmic Tuition Class.
Wang Lei continued, “You guys are very outstanding. The second lesson is over.”
“The second lesson is to familiarize yourself with your skills. From yesterday’s match, all of you have a certain personal understanding of your skills. Today, we will be having a team battle.”
A team battle? The four of them sighed at how Wang Lei and Wang Yu had so many tricks up their sleeves. Why did they come up with another team battle?
Next, Wang Yu began to explain the rules.
“Let’s add something fun to the team battle. There’s only one rule this time — snatch the flag!”
“Snatch the flag?”
Usually, there would be some group battles in university. However, the rules of the competition would be that a team would achieve victory when no members of the opposing team were on the field. They had never heard of team battles or snatching the flag.
Wang Yu continued, “That’s right, the rules are…”
“Firstly, each team will have a small flag. The team members will decide who they place the flag on. When the member with the flag on them goes out of bounds, the opposing team will win.”
“Secondly, if the person that goes out of bounds doesn’t have a flag on them, they will enter the waiting area and be revived in one minute.”
“Thirdly, if you are knocked down by the opponent, you will be eliminated.”
Wang Lei used a pile of chairs to form a circle and created an opening in the circle. Then, he said, “This is the revival area. As for the groups, Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang will form one team, while Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan will form the other team.”
After that, he handed the two palm-sized flags to the two teams. The moment the four of them saw the flags, they understood that the key to victory was to hide the flags and not let the opponents know who held them.
After that, Wang Yu gave each team half an hour to discuss their tactics.
Mo Xiu could still use God’s Eye once. He didn’t choose to use it on Yue Yuan, but on Liu Ziyang instead.
Mo Xiu basically knew Yue Yuan’s skills. Furthermore, at times like this, understanding his teammates’ skills was more important.
“First Skill: Afterimage.”
“Skill Effect: When the user is attacked, the user turns into an afterimage. After one second, the user can choose to appear anywhere within a one-meter radius of their original position. After triggering the skill, the user’s first critical hit (attack power is doubled) will increase by 50%.”
“Duration: One minute (User’s speed enhances state).”
“Cooldown: 2 hours.”
Unexpectedly, the fatty Liu Ziyang typically did not seem clever, but he had hidden most of his skills.
When he introduced the skill, Liu Ziyang did not say that his speed would increase after releasing the skill, nor did he mention anything about critical hits.
After what had happened yesterday, Mo Xiu wasn’t as careful when using the God’s Eye.
The discovery of Elder Tang’s presence was also beneficial. At least it proved that Elder Tang, Wang Lei, and Wang Yu had no evidence to prove that he had a second skill. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have probed him yesterday.
Hence, in the future, Mo Xiu would be able to use God’s Eyes openly. Even someone like Wang Yu would not be able to see through it. No one in this world would be able to.
Half an hour later, the four of them entered the arena.
Wang Lei and Wang Yu took out a table and started munching on melon seeds. They didn’t look like teachers at all.
“Begin!”
At the start of the competition, the four of them did not use any skills and entered the probing stage.
Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang were the first to move. The two of them moved apart.
This was because Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan’s skills were very suitable for engaging in teamwork.
If the combination of Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang was like adding one and one to produce two, then the result of Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan teaming up was more than two.
Thus, Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang separated at the start as they wanted Mu Qingyi and Liu Ziyang to split up and deal with them. They wanted to form two groups, with each member of the group fighting each other one-on-one.
Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang were not too far away from each other. If Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan chose to attack one person at the same time, they could quickly provide support to each other.
Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang slowly approached Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan from both sides.
Meanwhile, Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan two didn’t seem to notice Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang. Instead, they remained indifferent.
Just as Mo Xiu felt that something was wrong, Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan moved at the same time.
They attacked Liu Ziyang at an extremely fast speed, as if they had discussed it beforehand.
Mo Xiu knew that things were not looking good. His entire body flashed with golden light as he activated Descent of the Martial God and rushed to provide support.
However, he was still a step too late. Mu Qingyi quickly used her flying dagger to block Liu Ziyang’s escape path. Meanwhile, Yue Yuan had set up an array in advance.
The ground below Liu Ziyang’s feet flashed. After the array was triggered, he was frozen.
Next, Mu Qingyi used the back of her flying dagger to hit Liu Ziyang’s shoulder, causing him to fall to the ground.
In the end, Mo Xiu’s speed could not compare to that of the flying dagger. He could only watch as Liu Ziyang was eliminated.
It wasn’t that Liu Ziyang couldn’t dodge. Instead, he didn’t want to use his skills so easily.
Perhaps it was because everything happened too suddenly. Wang Yu only reacted after a second and said, “Liu Ziyang is out of bounds. The competition continues.”
The competition continued. This meant that the flag wasn’t on Liu Ziyang, but on Mo Xiu.
Liu Ziyang immediately came to the revival area. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu also jumped back to pull away from Mu Qingyi.
It was now two against one. Mo Xiu didn’t have the confidence to defeat the two of them, so he wanted to stall for time until Liu Ziyang revived.
However, Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan did something unexpected.
The two of them did not choose to seize the moment to attack. Instead, they stood at the entrance of the revival area.
Even Mo Xiu couldn’t help but sigh.
“F*ck, are you guys trying to collect the corpse?”
Yue Yuan said, “Why? Did the rules say that we can’t guard the corpse?”
Mo Xiu didn’t have the confidence to defeat the two of them. Neither did they have the confidence to defeat Mo Xiu within a minute.
It was better to guard the revival area. Once Liu Ziyang came out, they would defeat him. As long as they could drag it out until the time limit of Mo Xiu’s skill was up, they could naturally win easily.
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but say, “Yue Yuan, aren’t you too shameless?”
Yue Yuan looked towards Mu Qingyi, who grinned and said, “Mo Xiu, this was my idea.”
Mo Xiu said awkwardly, “Isn’t that a little despicable?”
As soon as these words came out, Yue Yuan was unhappy. If it was his idea, it would be shameless. However, if it was Mu Qingyi’s idea, then it was a little despicable. Why was this the case?
Yue Yuan pouted and said, “Mo Xiu, your double standards are too much.”
Mo Xiu also felt that his words were inappropriate and decided not to explain.
However, the problem Mo Xiu was facing now was not small. It was as if Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan were sitting at ease in a fishing boat despite the storms.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu was in a dilemma. If he attacked now, it would be difficult for him to win against two opponents. However, if he didn’t attack now, they would be able to stall for time.
Time passed. Neither side made a move. For a moment, the battlefield was in a deadlock.
Wang Lei asked Wang Yu who was beside him, “Shouldn’t we let them snatch the flag and let them compete normally? This is obviously a pure battle of wits.”
Wang Yu chewed on the melon seeds in his hand and looked at the arena seriously.
“Brother, your actual combat ability is very strong. What you lack is the ability to set up traps. Just watch, the show is about to begin. Watch carefully. It might end in the blink of an eye.”
Mo Xiu calculated the amount of time that had passed. It was almost time for Liu Ziyang to revive. He couldn’t delay any longer.
Step by step, he walked towards Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan.
When Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan saw that Mo Xiu had moved, they also perked up, knowing that the time for the decisive battle had arrived.
“Time’s up. Liu Ziyang has been revived!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!

                    



A Fake Move
“Time’s up. Liu Ziyang has been revived!”
When Liu Ziyang heard that he had been revived, he did not walk out immediately. Instead, he paused for a second to prevent Yue Yuan from setting up an array.
Sure enough, with a flash from the ground, an array was triggered. Liu Ziyang successfully dodged it.
However, Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan were really too close. The moment Liu Ziyang came out, the two of them did not use any more skills and directly attacked him.
At this moment, Mo Xiu also took the opportunity to arrive in front of the three of them. Meanwhile, when Liu Ziyang saw that the two of them were attacking, he immediately used his skill, Afterimage.
Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan looked left and right. They thought that Liu Ziyang would appear near the two of them so that he could attack at the same time as Mo Xiu.
However, they didn’t expect Liu Ziyang to appear behind Mo Xiu. Then, Mo Xiu took out his flag and passed it to Liu Ziyang.
Yue Yuan shouted, “Not good!” He stepped forward to interfere, but Liu Ziyang had already run far away.
Currently, Liu Ziyang was holding the flag in the distance, while Mo Xiu faced Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan alone.
The situation had been reversed. Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan did not expect that Mo Xiu would choose to help Liu Ziyang escape and face the two of them alone.
The two of them were also clear that even though Mo Xiu was unlikely to defeat both of them, it was not a problem for him to eliminate Mu Qingyi in a one-on-one battle.
If only Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang were left to fight, Yue Yuan had already used the array twice, while Liu Ziyang was still very energetic. Thus, Yue Yuan’s chances of winning were not high.
Yue Yuan decisively released two array formations around Mo Xiu and grabbed him.
“Mu Qingyi, go!”
Mu Qingyi ran forward, while Mo Xiu broke free from Yue Yuan and dodged two array formations as he chased after Mu Qingyi.
When Mu Qingyi saw that Mo Xiu did not choose to eliminate Yue Yuan first and was instead heading towards her, she immediately activated her skill and moved the flag into Yue Yuan’s hands.
Yue Yuan, who received the flag, stopped and hid it behind his back.
Right now, Mo Xiu was about to catch Mu Qingyi, but when he saw that Yue Yuan did not chase after him, he immediately turned around and changed directions.
Mu Qingyi also saw Mo Xiu’s actions and immediately activated the second displacement. She kept the small flag in her hand and turned around to continue attacking Liu Ziyang.
At this moment, Mu Qingyi heard two voices.
“Watch your back!”
“Sorry!”
The first shout was from Yue Yuan, and it was very loud. The second was from Mo Xiu behind Mu Qingyi, and his voice was very soft.
Mu Qingyi turned around abruptly, but she was still too slow.
Mo Xiu pushed Mu Qingyi’s shoulders with his right hand, his legs wrapped around Mu Qingyi’s body as he quickly placed Mu Qingyi on the ground.
Although Mu Qingyi was not weak, Mo Xiu’s speed and strength were much greater than hers thanks to his skill, Descent of the Martial God.
At this moment, Wang Yu stood up and announced, “Mu Qingyi has been eliminated. The competition has ended.”
Mu Qingyi quickly stood up and stared at Mo Xiu.
His gaze seemed to be saying, “You clearly went back to deal with Yue Yuan. Why were you behind me?”
In reality, Mo Xiu had only pretended and acted as if wanted to attack Yue Yuan. In reality, he had merely turned around and returned.
Furthermore, the key to their victory lay in this feint.
Wang Lei sighed and said, “It was indeed exciting. This kid, Mo Xiu, always brings us surprises. Wang Yu, did you guess this would be the outcome?”
Wang Yu shook his head and said, “No. I just knew that the outcome would be decided soon, but I didn’t expect it to be determined so soon.”
Wang Yu stood up and said to the audience, “Mo Xiu, tell me, how did you win?”
“Actually, I just made a fake move to make Mu Qingyi think that I went back to attack Yue Yuan.”
Mu Qingyi pouted and said with a puzzled expression, “I know that, but how did you know that the flag was with me?”
Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan were somewhat unhappy that they had lost just like that. In their eyes, Mo Xiu had made the right bet just now by choosing Mu Qingyi out of the two of them. If he had made the wrong bet, it would be hard to predict who would win.
Mo Xiu explained, “It’s very simple. I only thought about it from another perspective. What would I do if I were Mu Qingyi?”
“I would hold the flag. Thanks to the Spatial Folding skill, I would be able to teleport the flag to my teammate the moment it falls to the ground. This way, nothing would go wrong.”
“That’s why the flag was definitely in Mu Qingyi’s hands at the start. After confirming this point, the rest were all improvised.”
“When I faced the two of you alone, Mu Qingyi went to chase after Liu Ziyang, while Yue Yuan stayed behind to pester me. This shows that Yue Yuan was not afraid of being eliminated. It also means that the small flag was still in Mu Qingyi’s hands.”
“Next, I went to chase after Mu Qingyi. Yue Yuan stopped after a few steps, when I was about to attack Mu Qingyi. Even so, Mu Qingyi did not use any skills to counterattack, so there was only one possibility.”
The few of them listened attentively.
“That meant that Mu Qingyi had already used her skill, so she can’t use her skill anymore. That’s why I judged that Mu Qingyi had shifted the small flag to Yue Yuan’s body.”
Mu Qingyi asked again, “Since you knew that the flag was with Yue Yuan now, why didn’t you really attack him? Why did you use a fake move to trick me? Could it be that…”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “That’s right. The last time we fought, I knew that you had two skills, so I purposely made a fake move to let you take back the flag.”
Mu Qingyi rolled her eyes. “How cunning!”
Wang Yu came to the center of the arena and said, “In this team battle, we wanted you guys to combine strategies with actual combat. In the beginning, Mo Xiu’s team placed too much emphasis on actual combat, while Mu Qingyi’s team placed too much emphasis on strategy. However, the two members in Mo Xiu’s team combined both elements well towards the end. Meanwhile, Mu Qingyi’s team still focused on strategy, so they lost.”
Wang Lei looked at Wang Yu in surprise. Wasn’t this nonsense? How had Mo Xiu combined strategy into his actions?
Could it be that letting Liu Ziyang take the flag and watching the show by the side was his scheme? The key to victory in this battle was Mo Xiu’s ability to adapt on the spot.
When Wang Yu saw the look in Wang Lei’s eyes, he immediately gave him a look, telling him that the students were all here, so he shouldn’t undermine him.
Wang Lei added, “This is the third lesson on combinations. You have learned to combine strategy and actual combat, and to combine the skills of your teammates.”
Wang Yu continued, “Alright, that’s all for today. Everyone has their flaws in this battle. Go back and summarize what you have learned.”
…
In the evening, on a rock outside the courtyard…
Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi sat there to chat.
Ever since that conversation, the two of them had a tacit understanding. They would sit here every night for a while.
There were times when they chatted, while there were other times when they sat quietly.
“Mo Xiu, can you summarize the inadequacies of today’s battle? I’ll learn from you too.”
“I don’t think my team had any tactics. Instead, we wanted to win by fighting. That’s my weakness.”
“What about mine? What mistakes did I make today?”
“Do you want the truth, or do you want lies?”
“Tell me the lies first!”
“You were simply flawless. If I didn’t guess correctly at the last moment, you guys would have won.”
“Hahaha, what about the truth?”
“Your methods were very lousy.”
“Hmph! Why were they lousy?”
“Under such rules, your skill is practically a divine weapon. However, you were desperate to display this advantage, so you didn’t show your true strength.”
“Yes. Although the lie sounds good, I still like to hear the truth.”
The two of them looked at the moon in silence.
Mu Qingyi suddenly felt a little sad. She lowered her head and said, “Mo Xiu, the college entrance examination is coming up soon. Which university are you planning to enter?”
“I’m going to Yanjing University. What about you?”
“I might go somewhere far away. Will we meet again?”
“Of course, as long as you want to!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

The Crazy Wang Xuanhu
At the training grounds of Shun City First High School.
The day before yesterday, the entire school held their final mock exam before the college entrance examination.
In the previous mock exam, since some students had yet to awaken their skills, there was no skill assessment.
The last mock examination was the only test that included the skill assessment. In other words, the results of this test would be very similar to the results of the college entrance examination.
Every student placed great importance on this exam. They would not hide their abilities.
Today was the day for the results to be released. The school rankings were posted on the noticeboard in front of the field.
This announcement caused a sensation in the entire school.
In the past, the top two students in every mock exam were Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi. For the entire year, no one in the Year 3 batch had been able to do anything.
This time, the first two names were unfamiliar.
Wag Xuanhu was in first place, with a total score of 910 points.
Meanwhile, Liu Qingyu was in second place, with a total score of 893 points.
The maximum score for the college entrance examination was 1,000 points. In the history of the school, there were very few people who scored more than 900 points. Thus, the results of these two people were a little exaggerated.
Although Wang Xuanhu was among the top five of Year 3 Class 1 and had gotten third place many times, he had never entered the top ten in the entire school.
Liu Qing Yu was even more exaggerated. He had never entered the top hundred before.
Thus, the sudden rise of these two people caused quite a stir in the school.
As for the disappearance of Mu Qingyi and Mo Xiu, there were also some rumors.
The rumors about Mu Qingyi were more uniform. After all, everyone knew that Mu Qingyi’s family background was very good.
It was rumored that Mu Qingyi had been arranged by her family to transfer to a better high school for her final sprint.
Meanwhile, there were many varied rumors about Mo Xiu’s disappearance.
However, there were two types of rumors. One was from Mo Xiu’s best friend, Zheng Yi. Mo Xiu was arranged to be an exchange student by the school and was currently at another school.
However, there were many loopholes in this rumor. Firstly, the school had never heard of sending exchange students to other schools before. Secondly, even Zheng Yi could not say which school Mo Xiu was currently in.
Most people thought that Zheng Yi was trying to cover for Mo Xiu. Something might have happened to Mo Xiu.
The second rumor was spread by someone else. Mo Xiu had caused trouble outside and offended a big shot. Now, he was crippled and didn’t dare to show his face.
A good deed goes unnoticed, but a scandal spreads quickly. Furthermore, the rumors became more real and detailed over time. In the end, even the process of Mo Xiu being beaten up was described in detail. Some even said that they had seen this scene with their own eyes.
Rumors about Mo Xiu quickly spread to Ye Qian’er.
Ye Qian’er had been sad for a long time because of this. How could her benefactor encounter such a terrible thing?
Because of this, Ye Qian’er deliberately looked for Zheng Yi to ask about Mo Xiu.
Zheng Yi was also very annoyed. When the rumors spread, there was no way he could explain himself. He took out the message he sent to Mo Xiu two days ago and showed it to others, but others said that Mo Xiu was acting with him.
Zheng Yi repeatedly assured Ye Qian’er that Mo Xiu would be fine and would definitely return before the college entrance examination before persuading her to leave.
After Ye Qian’er returned, she explained Mo Xiu’s situation to her class. However, no one listened to her and thought that she was infatuated. They even imagined how Mo Xiu’s return would be like.
Some people were sad, but others were happy. Meanwhile, Wang Xuanhu was the most comfortable person these days.
Wang Xuanhu had a hard time a while ago. When the news of him being taught a lesson by Mo Xiu spread, he no longer had the airs of a young master. The detailed data regarding his skill would even affect his college entrance examination.
He only managed to make a comeback after the results were out. Thus, he felt extremely comfortable now.
Wang Xuanhu’s results were real. The reason why his strength had advanced by leaps and bounds was because his father had found a Spirit Ring for him.
Spirit Rings could directly raise the level of a skill to Level-2. The price of a Spirit Ring could be said to be astronomical. Furthermore, no matter how expensive this item was sold for, there would definitely be people who would buy it. Therefore, the supply would not meet the demand.
Wang Xuanhu’s father had spent almost all of his family fortune to buy this Spirit Ring. After consuming the Spirit Ring, Wang Xuanhu’s skill was upgraded to Level-2. He could even be ranked among the top in other major cities, let alone Shun City.
Now that his results had improved and the impact on his college entrance examination had been resolved, he was overjoyed to hear that Mo Xiu was crippled.
However, Wang Xuanhu was not satisfied. On that day at the training grounds, Mo Xiu had embarrassed him in front of so many people. How could he just let it pass?
However, now that he couldn’t find Mo Xiu for revenge, Wang Xuanhu could only target Zheng Yi.
The next day, at the training grounds of Shun City First High School…
Hundreds of people gathered in the training grounds. They were all attracted by today’s duel.
It was a duel between Zheng Yi, who had previously fought the Demonic Eagle, and Wang Xuanhu, the new king.
Wang Xuanhu had challenged Zheng Yi yesterday. With Zheng Yi’s personality, he naturally would not refuse.
The battle was not as intense as everyone had imagined. The entire process took less than five minutes.
Wang Xuanhu had crushed Zheng Yi.
Zheng Yi lay on the ground and gritted his teeth. “I admit defeat.”
The difference in skill levels was too great. Although Zheng Yi’s skill was very strong, Wang Xuanhu’s original skill was not weak. Coupled with the fact that Wang Xuanhu’s skill was one level higher than Zheng Yi’s, he easily defeated Zheng Yi.
Wang Xuanhu walked over and extended his right hand.
Zheng Yi thought that Wang Xuanhu wanted to help him up. He had just extended his hand when Wang Xuanhu retracted it.
After that, he kicked Zheng Yi’s hand ruthlessly. Zheng Yi was caught off guard. Then, Wang Xuanhu used all his strength, and Zheng Yi rolled on the ground in pain.
“Ah!!! Damn it, bastard.”
Wang Xuanhu kicked him again.
“Who are you talking about? I didn’t hear you clearly.”
Zheng Yi was sweating profusely from the pain. He gritted his teeth and said, “Just you wait!”
“Yo, Eldest Young Master Zheng, why can’t you beat him yourself? Are you looking for revenge?”
Zheng Yi trembled and did not speak anymore. The surrounding spectators also felt that Wang Xuanhu had gone overboard.
One of them came out and said, “Wang Xuanhu, you’ve already won. There’s no need for this, right?”
Wang Xuanhu widened his eyes and roared, “What? Do you have a problem with that? Do you want to come down and spar?”
For a moment, no one dared to speak up for Zheng Yi.
Wang Xuanhu still felt unsatisfied and wanted to kick Zheng Yi again.
“Wait, sparring has always stopped when victory is determined. Why are you forcing him to retaliate like this?”
When Wang Xuanhu heard this, he turned around and saw a thin man wearing glasses squeezing out from the crowd.
Wang Xuanhu said impatiently, “Who are you? Do you also want to exchange a few moves?”
“My name is Liu Qingyu. I’m willing to spar with you.”
“Liu Qingyu?”
Wang Xuanhu recalled that Liu Qingyu was ranked second in the mock exam. He was also on good terms with Mo Xiu.
“Alright, aren’t you willing to stand out? We’ll fight again tomorrow at this time.”
“Sure!”
Wang Xuanhu glared at Liu Qingyu. Then, the crowd immediately made way for him and left.
Liu Qingyu quickly helped Zheng Yi up and asked, “How are you? Are your injuries serious?”
Zheng Yi looked at his right hand and sighed. “Sigh, I’m afraid it’s a little serious.”
Liu Qingyu immediately sent Zheng Yi to the hospital. The test results were not ideal. His right wrist was fractured.
“Zheng Yi, the college entrance examination is coming up soon. I’m afraid that your hand will affect the examination. I have medicine at home that can treat it, but the process is rather painful.”
Zheng Yi’s face was pale. He waved his left hand and said, “I know what medicine you’re talking about. I have it at home. I’ve used it before, so I know how painful it is. This damned Wang Xuanhu.”
Liu Qingyu shook his head and sighed.
Zheng Yi continued, “As for you, what are your chances of winning against Wang Xuanhu?”
“Less than 10%!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Final Assessment
It was early in the morning. It was also the tenth day since Mo Xiu arrived at the Cosmic Tuition Class.
On the fourth day, after the group battle, Wang Lei set up the final test, which was to injure him.
This made the four of them very vexed. If they couldn’t even break through Wang Lei’s defenses, how could they injure him?
Over the past few days, Wang Lei and Wang Yu did not come up with any new tricks. They allowed the four of them to practice freely. Whenever they wanted to challenge Wang Lei, they would fight him.
The four of them had fought with Wang Lei quite a few times, but the results were just as tragic. Every time, they were beaten until they could not fight back.
Over the last two days, the four of them behaved abnormally and no longer challenged Wang Lei. Instead, they started fighting on their own, which surprised Wang Lei.
There was something that made Mo Xiu feel strange over the past few days.
Zheng Yi sent a message five days ago saying that the school was spreading rumors about him, but Mo Xiu told Zheng Yi not to mind them.
Given Zheng Yi’s personality, he would definitely not let the matter rest. However, he had not received any news from him for the past few days.
Last night, Mo Xiu asked Zheng Yi whether anything happened at school.
Zheng Yi only replied with two words, “It’s nothing.”
Mo Xiu’s instincts told him that Zheng Yi would definitely be fine. If not, Zheng Yi would not have acted so abnormally. He might as well return after today’s assessment and see what happened then.
The assessment began at 9 am.
Other than Wang Lei and Wang Yu, there was another person Mo Xiu was familiar with.
It was Elder Tang.
Mo Xiu was still wondering why Elder Tang had not made any moves for the past few days. This time, he actually took the initiative to appear.
Unlike Mo Xiu, Mu Qingyi, Liu Ziyang, and Yue Yuan all looked very serious when they saw Elder Tang appear.
Elder Tang sat down and said, “Don’t worry about me. I’m just here to take a look. You guys just have to perform normally.”
The last time Mu Qingyi had introduced Elder Tang, she had stopped mid-sentence. He must have participated in a great battle. Thus, it seemed like Elder Tang’s identity was not ordinary.
Wang Lei walked to the center of the arena and said, “Kids, whether or not you can become a Shadow depends on your performance this time.”
The four of them entered the arena. Then, Mo Xiu stood at the front and said, “Can we begin?”
Wang Lei spread out his hands and said, “The rules are the same as before. I will only use one skill. If you injure me, you win. Let’s begin.”
Mo Xiu activated Descent of the Martial God. Then, three rays of light rose from beneath his feet. The three metal arrays stacked on top of Mo Xiu’s body. As a result, his attack power was rather impressive.
Wang Lei narrowed his eyes. He obviously did not expect Yue Yuan’s skill to be used in such a way. He had stacked arrays to increase Mo Xiu’s attack power.
If that was the case, with Mo Xiu’s current attack power, a full-power strike should be able to injure him.
Wang Lei no longer stood still like before. Instead, he took the initiative to attack Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu used Baguazhang. Although it was only a basic martial art technique, it had relatively fewer weaknesses and was quite invasive.
As for Wang Lei’s moves, they didn’t involve any actual moves. Instead, it was a typical military style of fighting. Every move was aimed at Mo Xiu’s weak point. Furthermore, he simplified his movements as much as possible without any unnecessary movements.
Even if Mo Xiu had an attack boost, he would still be at a disadvantage after two moves.
At this moment, Mu Qingyi started to throw flying daggers to disturb Wang Lei. Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang wandered around, looking for an opportunity to attack Wang Lei from time to time. As for Yue Yuan, he took the opportunity to set up another array.
This was a tactic that they used frequently before, so they were very familiar with it.
Wang Lei said, “It’s still the same. How boring. Can you come up with something new?”
Seeing that they still had the same routine, Wang Lei gradually relaxed. He wanted to play with them for a while. Then, when he was done playing with them, he would deal with them together.
Just as Wang Lei was relaxing, he suddenly realized that Mo Xiu’s attacking style had changed. It was no longer Baguazhang. Instead, every move was firm and unyielding. Why did it seem like…
“Good boy. Are you using me for practice?”
Wang Lei finally reacted. Wasn’t the move Mo Xiu used his own attack?
He had actually learned his opponent’s techniques at such a critical moment to become stronger. Even an expert of Wang Lei’s level felt a chill in his heart.
Wang Lei immediately changed his mind. He didn’t want to drag this on any longer and wanted to end the battle as soon as possible.
Mo Xiu was too much of a variable. He wasn’t a threat now, but it didn’t mean that he would think of a move to injure him in the next second.
Wang Lei began to attack ferociously, and Mo Xiu immediately felt the pressure multiply.
“Liu Ziyang, help me!”
When Liu Ziyang heard this, he immediately charged forward. He held his dagger and attacked Wang Lei a few times.
However, Wang Lei wanted to get rid of Mo Xiu. Liu Ziyang couldn’t break through his defense anyway, so Wang Lei simply ignored him.
As a result, the battle became a battle between Wang Lei and Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu struggled to hold on, while Liu Ziyang chased after Wang Lei but to no avail.
Suddenly, Mo Xiu staggered and was punched by Wang Lei. After taking a step back, Mo Xiu actually punched Liu Ziyang.
Wang Lei thought that Mo Xiu had gone mad. He had even beaten up the members of his own team. He didn’t care about anything else and continued to attack.
However, Liu Ziyang’s Afterimage was triggered by Mo Xiu’s attack. In the next second, he appeared behind Wang Lei.
Two golden lights flashed, and two metal arrays were activated on Liu Ziyang.
At this moment, Wang Lei realized that he had been tricked. Mo Xiu had purposely hit Liu Ziyang just now. This way, he could trigger Liu Ziyang’s Afterimage. Previously, when he staggered, he had probably sent a signal to Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang.
During the battle a few days ago, Wang Lei also knew that Liu Ziyang’s first attack after activating Afterimage would result in a critical hit. Now, with the support of the metal array, his attack power could not be underestimated.
He wanted to turn around and defend himself, but he was held back by Mo Xiu. Wang Lei understood that this was their killer move.
It had to be said that the older one was, the more experience they would have. Wang Lei did not turn around. Instead, he swung his right leg backwards with all his might.
Although he did not kick Liu Ziyang away, he had also used most of his strength. Liu Ziyang’s dagger did not cause any damage.
Seeing that he didn’t succeed, Mo Xiu let go of him. Meanwhile, Wang Lei turned around and kicked Liu Ziyang far away.
Right at this time, Mu Qingyi, who no one noticed, threw out three flying daggers.
Two of the flying daggers moved in midair and appeared in front of Wang Lei, completely blocking his line of sight. Thus, Wang Lei could only take a step back.
The last flying dagger flew towards Mo Xiu, who caught it.
Since Wang Lei took a step back, this gave Mo Xiu enough space to exert force.
All his attributes had been increased by 100%. The increase in speed could increase his attack power. Meanwhile, the increase in his toughness and endurance could increase the amount of force exerted. As for the increase in defense, it could allow him to use their full strength without any worries.
The strength that emerged from his feet on the ground reached his waist. Then, the strength in his waist reached his arms.
“Shua!!!”
Mo Xiu attacked with the dagger.
Blood dripped from Wang Lei’s arm.
They had succeeded!
Together, the four of them made the impossible possible.
“We’ve succeeded!!!”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan hugged each other to celebrate. Mu Qingyi also started to spin around excitedly.
Elder Tang and Wang Yu sighed as well. These four people had improved so much in these ten days.
Meanwhile, Wang Lei retracted his armor and started clapping.
“You little guys are pretty impressive. Everything that happened before was fake. You were all hiding this final move.”
“Everyone has improved. Yue Yuan used five metal arrays to increase Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang’s attack power. Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang used Mo Xiu’s attack to activate Afterimage and almost injured me.”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were grinning from ear to ear.
“Mu Qingyi had the two flying daggers move at the same time to block my line of sight. She used her skill for this. Lastly, Mo Xiu was too steady.”
Everyone looked at Mo Xiu because everyone knew that Mo Xiu was the greatest contributor.
However, Mo Xiu stood rooted to the spot, as if he hadn’t moved since Wang Lei was injured.
Actually, Mo Xiu had been in a state of shock the entire time. What shocked him wasn’t Wang Lei.
Instead, just as he used his understanding of Descent of the Martial God to injure Wang Lei with all his power, a golden light flashed in his mind.
His skill had been upgraded…Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!

                    



Skill Upgrade
His skill had been upgraded.
“Skill: God’s Eye 2.”
“Skill Effect: Can check all the skills of two targets.”
“Cooldown: 20 minutes.”
While Mo Xiu was sighing at the power of his skill, he also had doubts. He had a deeper understanding of Descent of the Martial God, so why did God’s Eye upgrade?
Mo Xiu hurriedly turned around and used his skills on Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang. He did not use it on Wang Lei and Wang Yu. This was still out of caution.
After the skill was released, it became Descent of the Martial God. When Mo Xiu saw the skill introduction, he was stunned.
“Skill: Descent of the Martial God 2.”
“Skill Effect: Increases all attributes by 300%.”
“Duration: 10 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 1 hour.”
Both skills had been upgraded, and it was a huge upgrade.
Mo Xiu was stunned for a long time and couldn’t control himself. His skills had been upgraded through training. However, why was it that when his understanding of a skill increased, both skills upgraded?
Mo Xiu looked at the dim skill pattern of his passive skill, Flip. Could it be because these two skills occupied the same skill position?
Wasn’t this so-called passive skill too powerful?
“Mo Xiu! Mo Xiu!”
Mo Xiu returned to his senses and saw Mu Qingyi patting his shoulder.
“Mo Xiu, what’s wrong?”
Mo Xiu said in embarrassment, “I was too excited and lost focus. I’m sorry.”
Then, he said to Wang Lei, “Teacher, have we passed?”
Wang Lei said, “You passed, you passed. You guys are really something to be able to injure me in a fight.”
It was unknown when Elder Tang had left, but Wang Yu was the only one sitting in the chairs.
Then, Wang Yu stood up and said, “Alright, you’ve passed. Take a rest and have lunch. I’ll tell you about joining the Shadow organization in the afternoon.”
Mo Xiu didn’t return to his room. Instead, he went to an empty spot outside the courtyard by himself.
Compared to joining the Shadow organization, the upgrade of his skills made Mo Xiu even more excited.
After all, strengthening oneself was the foundation of everything.
Mo Xiu released his skill, eager to test the power of Descent of the Martial God.
When the 300% increase in attributes took effect on Mo Xiu’s body, he finally understood why this skill was called Descent of the Martial God.
At this moment, Mo Xiu felt like he was a martial god. His entire body was filled with power.
With a punch, the sound of rushing wind could be heard.
If the current Mo Xiu were to fight Wang Lei, who had only used one skill, he might not win, but it would be no problem for him to injure Wang Lei.
Suddenly, a black shadow appeared. This black shadow gave Mo Xiu a very dangerous feeling.
Without another word, Mo Xiu threw a punch. It was as if this punch had landed on a piece of cotton. A sense of powerlessness was produced before a surge of energy surged over, forcing Mo Xiu to take several steps back.
“Not bad. I knew you were acting weird just now. It turns out that your skill has been upgraded, and the degree of this upgrade is not small. The skill should have increased all of your attributes by 300%, right?”
Mo Xiu looked over. This person was Elder Tang, who had just disappeared.
Mo Xiu immediately put up his guard. He still didn’t know if Elder Tang was a friend or a foe.
Elder Tang laughed out loud. “Don’t worry, you don’t have the strength to make me take action yet.”
Mo Xiu said, “Elder Tang, I’m very grateful for the opportunity to come to the Cosmic Tuition Class, but…”
“But you don’t know what my motive is, do you?”
Mo Xiu nodded.
Elder Tang continued, “When you’re old, you have to find some fun. Otherwise, it’ll be too boring. My interest is to understand everyone who enters the library, and this interest has continued for many years.”
“Then can you understand me?”
“No. You’re special and have a lot of secrets. However, I’ve changed my mind now. I’m not going to understand you anymore.”
Mo Xiu was alarmed again. What did he mean? Was he trying to silence him?
“Hahaha, I want to take you in as my disciple. How about it?”
“Take me in as your disciple? Is there anything special about me?”
“The starting point and growth rate of your skill is very strong. When Wang Yu taught you about the theories, there was something that he didn’t mention.”
“What was it?”
“Skills are relatively fair. Usually, the easier it is to upgrade a skill, the smaller the increase in the skill after upgrading. This means that the skill has a low growth rate. Meanwhile, if it is difficult to upgrade a skill, there will usually be a large increase after the skill is upgraded.”
Mo Xiu understood what Elder Tang meant. Descent of the Martial God was very strong at the beginning and had a high growth rate.
“I understand.”
“Furthermore, the starting point and the growth rate of your skill are not bad. More importantly, you are very similar to me when I was young.”
Elder Tang spoke casually, but his heart was in turmoil.
Putting aside whether Mo Xiu had a second skill, just this skill alone was enough to make Elder Tang want to take him in as a disciple.
His Level-1 skill increased all of his attributes by 100%. This was already very scary. When his skill increased to Level-2, it actually increased all of his attributes by 300%.
One had to know that Wang Lei’s skill, Inferno Armor, could only increase his attack power by 500% and increase his defense by 300% at Level-4.
Mo Xiu’s Level-2 skill was almost comparable to Wang Lei’s Level-4 skill. What kind of concept was that? It could no longer be described as a genius. He was practically a monster.
Mo Xiu said, “In that case, what benefits do I get if you accept me as your disciple?”
Elder Tang widened his eyes and said, “Rascal, I’m taking you in as my disciple, and you’re asking me for benefits?”
Mo Xiu spread his hands and said, “You were the one who looked for me and wanted to take me as your disciple. I’m not the one who wanted to take you as my master. Even if you want to take me as your master, there should still be a welcome gift.”
Elder Tang was furious. He threw a box on the ground and left.
“Brat, I’ve already prepared the gift. I’ll contact you later.”
Actually, Mo Xiu wasn’t asking for a gift. He was testing Elder Tang to see how true his words were.
From Elder Tang’s reaction, it seemed like he really meant no harm.
Mo Xiu picked up the box and opened it to find a black dagger inside.
He took it out and played with it for a moment. He discovered that apart from being unusually sharp, there was nothing special about it.
This time, Mo Xiu didn’t understand. Although he didn’t know Elder Tang’s true identity, he was still a big shot.
His skills were suitable for heavy weapons or long weapons like swords and sabers. It was impossible for Elder Tang to not notice this. Why did he give him a dagger?
Mo Xiu could not understand what was going on. He kept the dagger and returned to the courtyard.
Mu Qingyi, Liu Ziyang, and Yue Yuan were at the door.
Liu Ziyang saw Mo Xiu and immediately said, “Aiya, Mo Xiu, where did you go? We were looking for you.”
Mo Xiu was puzzled. “Why were you looking for me? It’s not class time yet.”
Mu Qingyi laughed lightly and said, “We’re looking for you to have lunch together. Let’s have a farewell meal!”
They went to the canteen and sat down.
Mo Xiu said, “Since we’re about to split up, let’s find a way to contact each other. Also, where are you guys going to university?”
The few of them were not weak. They could probably choose from a wide range of schools.
Liu Ziyang said, “I’m going to Yanjing University. Boss Mo Xiu, aren’t you going there too? Take care of me when the time comes.”
Mo Xiu smiled. “Do you need me to take care of you?”
Yue Yuan said, “I should be staying in Shun City. Although Shun City’s university might be a little lacking, my family is here. I have to stay.”
They nodded and looked at Mu Qingyi.
“I might go to Beijing or the northern part of the Alliance.”
The northern part of the Alliance was too far away from Shun City and Beijing. Only then did Mo Xiu understand why Mu Qingyi had said she would go to a far place.Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Shadow
In Shun City First High School, in the classroom of Year 3 Class 1…
Zheng Yi sat in his seat with a frown.
If Mo Xiu was here right now, he would definitely be shocked. After all, Zheng Yi had never been in such a state before.
The past few days had been tough for Zheng Yi. Although his right hand had been treated with medicine, he still felt a slight pain.
The duel between Liu Qingyu and Wang Xuanhu was very exciting, but Liu Qingyu still lost in the end.
Wang Xuanhu had also suffered a little in that battle. These days, he had vented almost all his resentment on Zheng Yi.
He continuously provoked and challenged Zheng Yi.
Zheng Yi calmed down a little after getting injured. He did not want to affect his college entrance examination results because of a moment of pique.
Even though he had been called trash and a coward, he had endured it until now.
Zheng Yi leaned back in his chair and sighed. “Ah, Mo Xiu, do you know how tough it has been for me while you were away?”
Although he said this, Zheng Yi was stubborn deep down. He didn’t want Mo Xiu to know about his current situation. He didn’t want Mo Xiu to destroy his original plan for him.
Ye Qian’er also suffered. After all, not many people believed Ye Qian’er’s words.
The source of her news, Zheng Yi, had been bullied by Wang Xuanhu. Thus, the students were also mocking Ye Qian’er.
…
At the courtyard of the Cosmic Tuition Class…
In the classroom.
Wang Yu wrote a word on the blackboard.
The word was “Shadow”.
“Do you know who the Shadows are?”
“The Shadows make up a department of the Alliance that eliminates internal strife. They specialize in punishing people who use their skills to cause harm to society.”
“You might ask, isn’t that the mission of the law-enforcement team? Then let me ask you, if anyone in the law-enforcement team breaks the law, who will punish them?”
Only then did Mo Xiu realize that the Shadows had such a responsibility. He had always thought that Shadows was the most free department.
“The Shadows belong to the Alliance but are relatively free. Unless the Alliance is in danger, the members can choose not to carry out any missions.”
“I’ll tell you what to take note of next.”
“One, the Shadow’s only external symbol is this medal. Your name and number are engraved on the back of the medal. I suggest you carry it with you.”
Wang Yu held a shiny black medal in his hand.
“Secondly, the Shadow’s name might be misleading, but I have to tell you that Shadows are not a secret organization. You can reveal your identity and fight for your rights.”
“Thirdly, there is a hierarchical system among the Shadows. The Shadows are ranked from Level-1 to Level-10. When carrying out the same mission, the low-leveled Shadows will have to listen to the commands of the high-level Shadows.”
“Fourthly, you will download a software. You can accept missions using the software. You will receive cash and points as rewards after completing missions. You can increase your level by accumulating points.”
“That’s all. You can take your time to understand the rest. The medal production will take some time. Meanwhile, you can download the software to your phones. When the medal production is complete, someone will contact you.”
“I almost forgot the most important thing. The management of Shadows is relatively free, but there is a bottom line. If someone causes harm to society or uses their identity as a Shadow to commit crimes, someone will punish them.”
The four of them downloaded the software.
The software was strange. There was no option of creating an account.
There was only a line of words and an input bar.
“Please fill in your personal information.”
Mo Xiu entered his personal information as requested and accessed the software.
The software was simple. There were only two large panels, one for the mission and one for his profile.
Mo Xiu opened his profile and read what was written on it.
“Name: Mo Xiu.”
“Level: 1.”
“Current Points: 0.”
“Remaining Cash: 0.”
After looking through the software, Mo Xiu realized that there was actually nothing. The purpose of this software was to accept missions.
In the evening, the four of them packed their luggage and prepared to leave.
When they walked out of the courtyard, everyone had a car to pick them up.
Gao Quan was waiting for Mo Xiu. Then, the four of them parted after a simple farewell.
Mu Qingyi smiled and said to Mo Xiu, “See you at the college entrance examination.”
After Mo Xiu got into the car, Gao Quan asked, “How is it? Is it done?”
Mo Xiu nodded and said, “Yes, I passed the test. Didn’t you know?”
“How would I know? I’m not a member of the Shadows.”
Along the way, Mo Xiu asked Gao Quan many times if anything had happened at school. Gao Quan did not respond.
The more this was the case, the more uneasy Mo Xiu felt. What could have happened at school?
Tomorrow was a school holiday, and the day after tomorrow was the day of the college entrance examination. Even if something were to happen, he would not know, so he could only ask Zheng Yi.
The journey home was always long. After some time, Mo Xiu reached home.
The moment he entered, he saw his mother busying herself at the table. Mo Xiu had sent a message in advance, so Li Yuan had prepared a table full of dishes.
However, Mo Xiu didn’t come back after a long time, so the dishes were reheated over and over again.
The moment Mo Xiu opened the door, Li Yuan took Mo Xiu’s luggage and welcomed him in.
“Xiao Xiu, how did you do outside?”
Mo Xiu grabbed the luggage and said, “Pretty good. I’ve learned a lot.”
“That’s good, that’s good!”
Mo Xiu sighed. His mother had always been like this. She didn’t ask too many questions and silently gave her all.
After dinner, Mo Xiu returned to his room to lie down and sent a message to Zheng Yi.
“I’m back. Shall we meet tomorrow?”
After a long while, Zheng Yi replied.
“I’m going to train in seclusion to prepare for the college entrance examination.”
Mo Xiu did not reply. If there was anything, they would talk when they meet.
Actually, this message was sent after careful consideration by Zheng Yi, even though it was unlikely that the word ‘deliberate’ would apply to Zheng Yi.
Zheng Yi did not want to affect Mo Xiu’s college entrance examination, so he said that.
The next day, Mo Xiu did not undergo any training and spent the entire day trying to relax.
He helped his mother with the chores and went out to buy groceries. When he came back, he clumsily cooked a meal.
After dinner, her mother commented on Mo Xiu’s food.
“This child is worth teaching!”
Mo Xiu didn’t know if what he did was good or bad.
After dinner, Mo Xiu lay on the bed and browsed through the Shadow software.
“Grade-D investigation mission. Investigate the mysterious factory. Reward: 100 points and 50,000 yuan.”
“Grade-C annihilation mission. Annihilate the group of Black Foxes. Reward: 1,500 points and 800,000 yuan.”
“Grade-B capture mission. Capture a fugitive. Reward: 5,000 points and three million yuan.”
…
“Grade-SSS bounty mission. Obtain the Black Dragon Eye. Reward: 10 million points and 10 billion yuan.”
Previously, he didn’t take a closer look at the missions. However, when he took a closer look, there were minor missions that involved finding items, and major missions that involved killing Beast Emperors. There were all kinds of missions.
The rewards were also very generous. Mo Xiu decided to take on some missions after the college entrance examination.
On one hand, it was to supplement the family’s income so that his mother would not have to work overtime every day for a meager salary.
On the other hand, he needed to save up some money to buy herbs. Mo Xiu had heard that university was different from high school. It was useless to just work hard. Only with sufficient resources could one successfully grow.
Mo Xiu had no connections or money to enter the university. He could only use his identity as a Shadow to obtain resources.
Although he had a cheap master, he didn’t even know where his master was now. He didn’t even have a way to contact him, so he had to rely on himself for everything.
When Mo Xiu thought about his cheap master Edler Tang, Mo Xiu took out the black dagger.
At first, he played with it in his hand, but later, he started to punch with the dagger. He found it quite convenient to use it.
“That old man is really stingy. He said he would give me a gift, but in the end, he gave me a weapon that doesn’t suit me.”
“Bang!!!”
Mo Xiu stared at the shattered glass and the black dagger outside the window, speechless.
The dagger had extended!!!Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

College Entrance Examination (1)
Early in the morning, it was the day of the college entrance examination. Mo Xiu woke up early to pack up.
He had originally wanted to sleep yesterday, but he later discovered that the black dagger could actually be extended. In the end, he studied it until very late before sleeping.
After Mo Xiu’s research, he discovered that the black dagger was extremely magical.
As long as he held the handle tightly, it would extend. The greater the force, the longer the dagger would be.
Yesterday, it was precisely because he was careless that he exerted force on the handle and allowed the dagger to pierce through the glass.
Mo Xiu packed up his things and left.
He wanted to ask Zheng Yi to leave with him, but he did not reply to his messages. Furthermore, he did not see Zheng Yi at school.
However, he saw Mu Qingyi at the school gate. She was currently surrounded by a group of people.
She seemed to be in a difficult position as she looked around. When she saw Mo Xiu, it was as if she had seen her savior. She squeezed through the crowd and ran towards Mo Xiu.
Everyone was stunned when they saw that it was Mo Xiu.
Wasn’t Mo Xiu crippled? How could he still take the college entrance examination?
The group of people who were originally enthusiastic towards Mu Qingyi all moved far away.
Firstly, they had heard that Mo Xiu had offended an important figure and didn’t want to have anything to do with Mo Xiu to avoid implicating himself.
Furthermore, Wang Xuanhu could be said to be at the peak of his career at school.
During this period of time, everyone related to Mo Xiu had been dealt with by Wang Xuanhu. Thus, no one dared to talk to Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu saw that everyone was looking at him strangely and asked Mu Qingyi softly.
“Qingyi, what is going on?”
The relationship between the two of them had advanced by leaps and bounds in the Cosmic Tuition Class. Although they did not have any romantic feelings towards each other, they had already reached the stage where they knew each other well. Therefore, Mu Qingyi did not find it strange for Mo Xiu to ask her that.
“I don’t know either. I was surrounded by these people the moment I arrived at school. They kept asking me where I had been during this period of time, and why I came back for the college entrance examination?”
Then, Mo Xiu thought of the rumors about him that Zheng Yi had told him about. Perhaps these people believed those rumors and didn’t dare to interact with him.
The two of them went separate ways after entering the school building. Mo Xiu was in the third examination hall while Mu Qingyi was in the seventh examination hall.
The college entrance examination only lasted for a day, and was split into the morning and afternoon session. The written examination and the physical examination were in the morning, while the skill examination was in the afternoon.
An hour or so after the exam, the results would be out.
After that, the major schools would pick people based on their scores and high school records.
About three days later, the students would be informed that they had been accepted by the schools. They would then select the schools that they wanted to go to.
Firstly, the written examination tested the theoretical knowledge in the textbooks. It was the simplest of the subjects, and with a little effort, one would not score too badly.
The perfect score was 200 points. In normal mock exams, there were countless people who could score full marks.
Mo Xiu also finished this examination relatively easily. The first few multiple-choice questions and cloze questions were all basic questions.
The only difficult question was the last short-answer question.
After being taught by Wang Yu in the Cosmic Tuition Class, Mo Xiu had no problems answering.
Now, Mo Xiu’s understanding of skills was much higher than most people.
He finished answering the questions in less than an hour. The rest of the time was spent checking and handing in the papers.
After leaving the examination hall, Mo Xiu took out his phone and sent a message to Zheng Yi.
“Where did you go? Why didn’t I see you? Reply me once you see this message.”
After waiting for a long time, it was almost time for the next exam. However, Zheng Yi did not reply.
Mo Xiu could only go to the training grounds for the physical examination.
The physical examination was divided into three categories: the strength test, the speed test, and an actual combat test. Skills could not be used.
The total score was 400 points. The strength test and speed test were out of 150 points each. Meanwhile, the actual combat test had a total score of 100.
This was because high school students didn’t have much actual combat experience. Furthermore, they could slowly improve after entering university. Thus, the physical examination mainly tested their foundation.
At this moment, the training grounds were divided into fifty rooms. During the test, each room would have three teachers.
One was responsible for recording, one was responsible for supervising, and one was responsible for ensuring fairness.
Mo Xiu’s number was not at the front. Thus, he waited for a long time before entering the room.
“Mo Xiu, right? Put your hands above your head for inspection.”
The teacher in charge of fairness took two instruments and swept them over Mo Xiu.
One instrument checked if there were any foreign objects on his body, while the other instrument checked if there were any drugs that enhanced his body within the past 24 hours.
Before the college entrance examination, every form teacher would repeatedly emphasize that if the students wanted to use medicinal herbs to strengthen their body, they had to consume it early. Otherwise, they would not be able to pass the physical examination.
Even so, every year, many people would retire from the college entrance examination because they could not pass this check.
“You have passed the inspection. We can conduct the physical examination.”
Mo Xiu came to the strength testing area first. There was a huge sandbag that was fixed in place.
Taking a deep breath, he steadied his step. He gathered all his strength from the ground, consolidated it at his waist, and exerted more force in his upper body. Then, all the strength was consolidated in his arm, and finally his fist.
Bang!
A loud sound shook the three teachers. How could there be such a loud sound?
When they looked at the data, they saw that the power of his punch was 387.12 kilograms.
The three teachers were in disbelief. Was he even human?
After that, the three teachers unanimously believed that there was a problem with the instrument. They were unable to achieve such results, let alone a high school student. It was really unbelievable.
After checking that there were no problems with the instrument, the three teachers asked Mo Xiu to do another test.
The power of his punch was 388.01 kilograms.
It was even higher than last time. The strength test had a perfect score of 235 kilograms. Thus, this result was simply too shocking.
To ensure accuracy, the three teachers brought Mo Xiu to another room for another test.
The power of his punch was 388.75 kilograms.
The results were getting higher and higher. No matter how much the three teachers did not believe the results, they had to admit this fact.
This student named Mo Xiu was a monster.
Actually, Mo Xiu’s fist strength wasn’t that exaggerated. The reason why it had increased so much was because Mo Xiu had just understood how to maximize the strength of his fist.
After that, the speed test was conducted.
Mo Xiu ran 100 meters in 6.12 seconds.
Although it was not as exaggerated as his results in the strength test, it was still much better than the perfect score of 7 seconds.
The final combat test was a battle between students.
The doors of the two rooms opened, and a student walked into the room where Mo Xiu was being tested.
Mo Xiu didn’t know this person, but this person knew Mo Xiu.
This person’s name was Fang Jie. He was ordinary in school and did not have any outstanding qualities. At this moment, he was dejected because he did not perform well in the strength test.
When he saw Mo Xiu, his spirits were lifted. He had heard that Mo Xiu had already been crippled. This was equivalent to picking up a huge bargain.
The scores in the actual combat test were not determined by victory or defeat. Instead, the six teachers present would determine their scores at the same time. Then, the average score would be taken.
However, winning the battle would more or less give the victor some bonus points.
Fang Jie walked into the arena and said provocatively, “Come on, I know you. I’ll show mercy.”
The three teachers who came with Fang Jie were still alright, but the three who had just tested Mo Xiu were stunned.
How much did he drink? Where did his confidence come from? He knew who Mo Xiu was, yet this student still provoked him.
One of the teachers had just verified that Mo Xiu’s strength test results had broken the college entrance examination record.
Did this student want to show mercy against such a monster?
Even if Mo Xiu didn’t have any actual combat experience, just the pressure from his strength would be enough to kill Fang Jie.
Following Mo Xiu’s entrance, the teacher announced the start of the battle.
Fang Jie advanced quickly and launched a punch.
Mo Xiu took a step back unhurriedly. Then, he raised his right hand above his head and pressed down on Fang Jie’s head, exerting a little force.
Dong!
Fang Jie fell to the ground with his face on the ground. Mo Xiu turned around to look at the teacher, implying that he was wondering why the competition had not ended yet.
Several teachers went forward to check the situation.
Fang Jie’s mouth was agape and his eyes were blank. He had clearly lost consciousness.Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

College Entrance Examination (2)
“Mo Xiu wins. The physical test has ended. Um… The examinees can leave now.”
When Mo Xiu walked out of the room, the six teachers were discussing.
After the exam in the morning, he still could not find Zheng Yi during lunch break, so he could only find a restaurant to eat at.
It was soon afternoon. The skill assessment in the afternoon could be said to be the most important part of the college entrance examination.
The total score was 400. This alone could show its importance.
Not only that, many universities would prioritize checking the scores of the skill assessment when they looked at the examination results.
Due to the importance of one’s score in the skill assessment, there would always be students with high scores who were not accepted by their ideal schools in the past years.
This was because both their written test and physical test scores were very high. Only the skill test was a burden.
The venue of the skill assessment was in the science and technology classroom. It was specially used for testing skills.
It was usually open, but students had to pay a fee to use the room. Furthermore, the price wasn’t something Mo Xiu could afford, so Mo Xiu had never entered the room.
Mo Xiu took the admission ticket and entered the science and technology classroom. Then, the staff led Mo Xiu into one of the rooms.
After observing the room, he realized that it was a sealed space with only one door, which was closed after entering.
Three of the walls were made of metal, while the last wall was made of glass. He could vaguely see two people sitting behind the glass.
Mo Xiu was about to take a closer look when he heard a voice.
The voice came from the loudspeaker on the roof of the room.
“Examinee, please wear the glasses and prepare for the exam.”
Mo Xiu looked around and saw a box in the corner.
When he opened the box and took a look, he found that it was more like a helmet than a pair of glasses. Mo Xiu took it out and put it on his head.
After putting it on, the helmet automatically locked and wrapped around Mo Xiu’s head.
The helmet didn’t affect his vision, and Mo Xiu could clearly see everything around him.
“Examinee, please raise your right hand. You will enter the assessment in three seconds.”
Mo Xiu followed the instructions and raised his right hand. Then, he heard the countdown.
“Three.”
“Two.”
“One.”
“The assessment begins.”
After the assessment began, the glass wall gradually disappeared and became an iron wall.
After that, two men in black appeared in the room. One of them had the word ‘friend’ written on it, while the other had the word ‘enemy’ written on it.
Mo Xiu immediately understood. One of them was his teammate, while the other was his enemy.
Without hesitation, he activated Descent of the Martial God to provide him with support.
When Mo Xiu reached the battleground between the two of them, the enemy suddenly injured his teammate with a punch and jumped back.
Mo Xiu reached out to pull his teammate up. However, when he touched his teammate, his teammate disappeared.
When he raised his head to look at the enemy, his enemy actually disappeared as well. Mo Xiu looked around but didn’t find any traces of the man in black.
Suddenly, the man in black appeared in front of Mo Xiu and punched him.
Mo Xiu immediately responded, but when he hit the man in black, it felt like he was hitting a steel plate.
No matter how Mo Xiu attacked, he could not defeat the man in black. As time passed, Mo Xiu realized that the strength of the man in black was increasing.
In the end, the black-clothed man’s strength increased to the point where Mo Xiu was unable to fight back. He threw a punch at Mo Xiu’s head.
“The assessment is over.”
Following the sound of the computer, the man in black disappeared and the glass wall appeared again.
Mo Xiu took off his helmet and put it back in the box, waiting for further instructions.
Mo Xiu roughly understood the mechanism of the skill assessment. In the beginning, when the two men in black fought, they wanted to test the candidate’s auxiliary skills. If they had an auxiliary skill, they could use it on their teammates.
After that, when his teammate was injured and fell to the ground, they were testing the healing skills of the examinees. One could treat their teammate if they had healing skills.
After that, the enemy disappeared. This was to test the detection skills of the examinees.
The final battle was to test the limits of their combat skills.
Mo Xiu did not hide his strength during the exam. Instead, he went all out to fight.
Hiding a secret was indeed very important, Mo Xiu felt that it was enough to hide God’s Eye.
If he had to hide the Descent of the Martial God, it would be too cowardly.
However, Mo Xiu was very curious if this detection system could detect God’s Eye.
After five minutes, the teacher said, “The assessment is over. Please leave.”
Mo Xiu walked out of the science and technology classroom and strolled around the field alone.
“Mo Xiu, you’re here!”
Mo Xiu saw that it was Mu Qingyi and walked over with a smile.
“Yes, yes. I just finished the exam and I’m waiting for the results. How did you do?”
Mu Qingyi said, “Not bad. What about you? There shouldn’t be any problems, right?”
“I didn’t face any problems. Everything is going smoothly. By the way, which school are you going to?”
Mu Qingyi said hesitantly, “Actually… I’m going to the Federal Academy.”
Mo Xiu was a little surprised. The three major colleges in the Alliance were Yanjing University, the Federal Academy, and the Academy of Faith.
These three schools corresponded to the three pre-war powers.
Although humans belonged to the Alliance now, they would not be able to get into the Federal Academy by taking the college entrance examination in Shun City.
Firstly, it was because of the distance. Furthermore, the living habits of both regions were somewhat different.
“Was it arranged by your family?”
Mu Qingyi had long said that everything was arranged by her parents, and she had no right to make any decisions.
Mu Qingyi nodded lightly and said, “Yes, we might not meet again in the future.”
“You can’t decide everything for yourself, but I can decide mine. I’ll look for you in the future.”
“Really?”
“Really.”
…
An hour later, the results were announced. Everyone’s results were posted on the field’s noticeboard and sent to their phones.
When Mo Xiu received the message, he immediately went home. This was because his score was 1,000.
He had obtained full marks. As far as Mo Xiu knew, in all these years of college entrance examinations, less than ten people had obtained full marks.
If he stayed at school, he might be pestered by the reporters, so he could only go home.
“First place: Mo Xiu. Results: 1,000 points.”
“Second place: Mu Qingyi. Results: 981 points.”
“Third place: Liu Qingyu. Results: 923 points.”
“Fourth place: Zheng Yi. Results: 901 points.”
“Fifth place: Wang Xuanhu. Result: 898 points.”
After seeing the rankings, Wang Xuanhu was the most furious. He originally thought that he would definitely win first place in Shuncheng High School.
Putting aside the fact that Liu Qingyu and Zheng Yi were ahead of him, Mo Xiu actually scored full marks.
Now, Wang Xuanhu only had one thought. Mo Xiu had cheated. He had to find Mo Xiu and make him reveal his true colors.
Meanwhile, Ye Qian’er, who was in a daze at home, received more than ten messages in a row.
Ye Qian’er was a little confused. Ever since she insisted that nothing had happened to Mo Xiu, she had been ostracized. Why would so many people suddenly contact her?
After reading the messages, Ye Qian’er hurriedly put on her clothes and ran to school.
This was because those messages were from her classmates. They were apologizing to Ye Qian’er.
Most of the messages said, “Qian’er, I’ve wrongly accused you. I didn’t mean to badmouth Senior Mo. Can you put in a good word for me and introduce me to him?”
Some other messages said, “Mo Xiu is too fierce. From now on, Mo Xiu will be my idol.”
When Ye Qian’er arrived at the field, she almost cried when she saw the ranking.
It wasn’t because Mo Xiu did well, but because it proved that Mo Xiu was fine.
For so many days, no matter how bad the rumors were, Mo Xiu did not respond. Even Zheng Yi had gotten in trouble.
Ye Qian’er thought that something had really happened to Mo Xiu.
However, it now seemed that Mo Xiu was fine. That was great.Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

So That’s The Case
The next morning, Mo Xiu got up to look for Zheng Yi.
The moment he stepped out, a group of reporters surrounded him.
“Mo Xiu, as the top scholar of the college entrance examination, what do you have to say?”
Someone squeezed up from behind and said, “What kind of standards are those? You’re a new reporter, right? Mo Xiu, you scored full marks this time. Many people are questioning whether you cheated or not.”
“Mo Xiu, there are people speculating that you are from a prestigious family. Why are you staying here?”
Mo Xiu shut the door without a word, not wanting to listen to the chatter from the reporters.
Outside the door, people kept saying, “Mo Xiu, even if you’re the top scholar of the college entrance examination, you can’t be so rude.”
“Yeah, you’re so arrogant. I’m going to write an article to condemn you.”
Annoyed, Mo Xiu jumped out of his room window.
After Mo Xiu returned home yesterday, he had a simple celebration with his mother before going to bed.
He did not know that news of him getting full marks had spread like wildfire.
After a night of fermenting, too many people were alarmed.
In just one night, the principals of the various colleges, the higher-ups of the various powers, and this group of reporters had investigated all of Mo Xiu’s information. A student who scored full marks was actually living in a dilapidated neighborhood.
This allowed the reporters to unleash their imaginations and make all sorts of conjectures. Hence, they came early in the morning to stop Mo Xiu.
After Mo Xiu jumped out, he immediately called Zheng Yi, but no one picked up.
…
At the training grounds of Shun City First High School…
The training grounds, which should have been empty during the holidays, was now packed with people.
This was because there was an important match today. It was the second battle between Zheng Yi and Wang Xuanhu.
This battle was arranged by Wang Xuanhu because Zheng Yi was ranked ahead of him in the college entrance examination.
Zheng Yi agreed immediately. Actually, even if Wang Xuanhu did not look for him, he would look for Wang Xuanhu.
Zheng Yi was never one to swallow his pride. Previously, he had no choice but to endure for the sake of the college entrance examination.
After the college entrance examination ended, Zheng Yi could no longer tolerate it and wanted to settle scores with Wang Xuanhu immediately.
Hence, for the past few days, Mo Xiu had been looking for Zheng Yi, but Zheng Yi had not replied.
He only wanted to tell Mo Xiu what had happened after he had settled everything with Wang Xuanhu.
Wang Xuanhu said, “I really didn’t expect that a good-for-nothing like you would dare to agree to my challenge after hiding from me for so many days.”
Zheng Yi pursed his lips and said, “The reason for your challenge this time is probably because you didn’t do well in the college entrance examination, right?”
“You… If you hadn’t cheated, I would have been first.”
Zheng Yi laughed out loud. “How interesting. Are you saying that the four people in front of you cheated? You really dare to say that. Who can cheat during the college entrance examination?”
Wang Xuanhu was a little embarrassed. He had gotten fifth place this time partly because he did not expect Zheng Yi and Liu Qingyu to perform so well, and partly because of Mu Qingyi and Mo Xiu’s sudden return.
In addition, after Wang Xuanhu’s strength increased greatly, he became a little arrogant, causing him to neglect his training and revision. As a result, a lot of points were deducted from the written test and the physical test.
He had thought that victory was within his grasp, and that he would be able to brag about it everywhere he went. Now that he had been slapped in the face, how could he not feel hatred?
“You loser, I’m going to beat you up today. As for Mo Xiu, after I beat you up, he will be next. Don’t think that no one will suspect that he cheated and scored full marks. If I expose him, I will be a hero.”
Zheng Yi said, “Pfft, you aren’t even fit to carry Mo Xiu’s shoes. What hero are you? Don’t think I don’t know how your skill leveled up?”
Wang Xuanhu said indifferently, “So what if you know? If you have the ability, why don’t you upgrade your skill too? Don’t talk so much nonsense. I’ll definitely cripple you today.”
Zheng Yi became serious. Regardless, Wang Xuanhu’s strength was still above Zheng Yi’s.
The two of them entered the arena and got into a fight.
The entire audience held their breaths in silence.
“So that’s the case!!!”
A voice cut through the silence. It was not loud, but everyone could hear the anger in it.
The crowd opened up a path and a figure slowly walked over.
It was a figure that was very familiar to the two of them — Mo Xiu.
Zheng Yi first shouted, “Mo Xiu, this is my duel with him. It has nothing to do with you.”
Then, Mo Xiu said expressionlessly, “Do you think it’s very nice of you to take over everything?”
“Mo Xiu, I…”
Mo Xiu waved his hand and said, “Everything started because of me. I’ll settle it. Leave it to me.”
Zheng Yi wanted to continue, but in the end, he did not.
Meanwhile, Wang Xuanhu said disdainfully, “Stop acting like you’re brothers. It doesn’t matter who comes. Mo Xiu, you came at the right time. Today, I’ll let you know what true talent is. A piece of trash like you will have your reputation ruined from today onwards.”
Mo Xiu walked towards Wang Xuanhu step by step.
He spoke as he walked. His voice was neither loud nor soft, but every word he said was powerful.
“Some people don’t feel pain as long as they’re not beaten to death. Don’t you agree? Wang Xuanhu!”
Wang Xuanhu felt that his idea of victory was shaken at this moment.
Mo Xiu didn’t roar loudly. One couldn’t even tell what his emotions were, but he gave off a very strong sense of oppression.
“Cut the crap and start.”
Mo Xiu said, “Come at me!!!”
Then, he activated God’s Eye.
“Skill: Thorns 2.”
“Skill Effect: Spikes will be produced all over the body (The spikes can be fired. The strength of the shot depends on the base strength of the user). Increases defense by 150%, and increases strength and speed by 100% respectively.”
“Duration: 3 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 15 minutes.”
Mo Xiu had to admit that Zheng Yi’s loss to Wang Xuanhu made sense. After all, Wang Xuanhu’s skill was relatively strong.
Wang Xuanhu attacked Mo Xiu.
Then, Mo Xiu made a surprising move. He did not fight or use his skills. Instead, he took off his shirt.
His strong muscles were exposed, causing many girls to scream.
Meanwhile, Wang Xuanhu said angrily, “You’re still acting a pretentious prick!”
With a flash of golden light, Mo Xiu activated Descent of the Martial God.
“Today, I’ll show you the difference between us.”
Wang Xuanhu threw a punch at Mo Xiu. There were spikes on his fist, but Mo Xiu unexpectedly did not dodge.
Instead, a fist met Wang Xuanhu’s fist head-on.
Wang Xuanhu was forced back two steps. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu only had a small wound on his fist.
“How… How could your skill be so strong? Weren’t you crippled?”
After the first move, Wang Xuanhu knew that he was no match for Mo Xiu.
Wang Xuanhu still remembered Mo Xiu’s superb Baguazhang in the previous competition.
Wang Xuanhu knew that his chances of winning were slim when his skill did not provide him with an advantage.
Mo Xiu did not speak and walked straight to Wang Xuanhu.
“Even if your skill is strong, my defense is not something you can defeat. At the worst, I’ll defeat you… Ah!”
Before he could finish speaking, Mo Xiu punched Wang Xuanhu’s face again. Wang Xuanhu staggered and almost fell to the ground.
“Damn you…”
Bang!
“I…”
Bang!
“Mo Xiu!!! I…”
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Mo Xiu did not use any moves and just punched Wang Xuanhu.
Every punch was firm and without reservation.
Along the way, Wang Xuanhu tried to retaliate, but it eventually was futile under Mo Xiu’s relentless punches.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu’s punches were faster and faster. He struck Wang Xuanhu with pure strength, as if he was venting his emotions.
Meanwhile, Wang Xuanhu was standing at the beginning. Then, he sat down, before he lay down. He achieved all three forms of being beaten up.
Only then did the crowd understand why Mo Xiu had taken off his clothes.
This was because Mo Xiu was afraid of dirtying his clothes…Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Have You Vented Your Anger?
“Mo Xiu…”
Bang! Bang! Bang!
“I…”
Bang! Bang! Bang!
“Admit… Admit…”
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Wang Xuanhu wanted to admit defeat. However, at this moment, Mo Xiu’s eyes were red from fighting. He did not give Wang Xuanhu a chance to speak.
This battle could no longer be called a battle. Instead, it was a one-sided beating.
In the end, Mo Xiu’s fist stopped because Wang Xuanhu had lost consciousness.
Then, Mo Xiu stepped on Wang Xuanhu’s hand.
“Ah!!!”
Wang Xuanhu woke up from the pain and looked at Mo Xiu in horror.
“Mo Xiu, I was wrong. Stop hitting me. You’re not trash, I’m trash, alright?”
Mo Xiu squatted down and whispered into Wang Xuanhu’s ear, “There won’t be a next time, got it?”
Wang Xuanhu immediately replied, “I know, I know. I won’t provoke you again… Ah! Mo Xiu!”
Mo Xiu punched him again and shattered Wang Xuanhu’s right arm.
Wang Hu could no longer shout as he simply fainted.
Meanwhile, a commotion broke out in the crowd outside the arena. Mo Xiu usually appeared rather amiable. Thus, they didn’t expect him to be so ruthless.
Then, Mo Xiu stood up and walked towards Zheng Yi. “Have you vented your anger?”
Zheng Yi looked at Mo Xiu silently.
Mo Xiu turned around and was about to return to Wang Xuanhu and deliver a few more punches when Zheng Yi grabbed Mo Xiu.
“Enough, Mo Xiu. If you continue, he will die.”
Mo Xiu turned around and asked Zheng Yi the same question.
“Let me ask you, have you vented your anger?”
Zheng Yi returned to his normal self and said, “Barely. I originally wanted to humiliate him, but after I thought about it. Forget it. There’s no need to lower myself to the level of a dog.”
Zheng Yi did not say it out loud, but he was extremely touched.
The first time Wang Xuanhu attacked Mo Xiu, Mo Xiu calmly taught him a lesson.
However, he was clearly enraged this time. From the first sentence he said after arriving here, to every punch he threw at Wang Xuanhu, one could clearly see Mo Xiu’s anger.
Zheng Yi knew that Mo Xiu was doing all this for him. He was touched, but there was no need to say it out loud.
As for Mo Xiu, how could he not be moved? After all, Zheng Yi had been bearing too much responsibility these past few days. He didn’t even want to tell Mo Xiu about this.
The two of them looked at each other for a long time before laughing out loud.
“Hahaha, hahaha.”
The two of them laughed and left. The crowd was stunned when they saw the commotion.
What was going on? Mo Xiu had been extremely ferocious a moment ago, but now he was laughing and leaving?
Zheng Yi laughed out loud to express his grievances for the past few days.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu was laughing from the bottom of his heart. In the three years of high school, he had not only obtained strength, but also a trustworthy brother.
The two of them ignored the gazes of others and left just like that.
Then, they arrived at a small restaurant and started chatting as if they hadn’t seen each other for a long time.
“Mo Xiu, where did you go? You’re definitely not an exchange student, right? Did you go for special training somewhere? You scored full marks for the entrance examination too.”
Mo Xiu said, “I can’t tell you where I went. I promised others that I would keep it a secret. It can also be said to be a form of special training, and I improved a lot. As for you, sigh. It’s been hard on you.”
Zheng Yi shook his head and said, “Let’s not talk about it. This is the only time in my life that I’ve been vexed. I’ll treat it as an experience. Oh right, I originally wanted to settle this matter myself. Anyway, how did someone who has such poor news sources like you know that I was there?”
“It was Mu Qingyi who told me everything.”
When Zheng Yi heard Mo Xiu mention Mu Qingyi, his expression became strange.
“The two of you disappeared together. Have you won her over? How impressive. You’ve done all the awesome things in the world.”
Mo Xiu said, “Don’t speak nonsense. There is nothing between Qingyi and me.”
“Hahaha, you even called her Qingyi. Are you sure that there’s nothing? Do you think that I am a fool?”
“Aiya…”
Mo Xiu decided not to explain.
Then, Zheng Yi suddenly became serious. “When it comes to women, I have to mention someone.”
“Who is it?”
“It’s Ye Qian’er. When she heard the rumors about you, she came to look for me. I told her that you were fine. After that, she went back and stopped the rumors. At that time, she also suffered a lot of disdain from others.”
Mo Xiu turned around and said, “Got it. I’ll thank her when I have the chance.”
Zheng Yi added, “There’s also Liu Qingyu. If not for him, I might have lost half my life. One day, I’ll treat him to a meal. You have to come…”
While the two were eating and chatting, the news of Mo Xiu beating up Wang Xuanhu spread.
News regarding Mo Xiu appeared on various websites. Some said that this incident proved that Mo Xiu’s college entrance examination results were real. Meanwhile, others said that not only was Mo Xiu arrogant and rude, but even beat up his classmate.
However, no matter what news it was, in less than half a day, all the news regarding Mo Xiu were taken down.
No one knew the reason. Even the higher-ups of the various websites did not talk about it.
In the Shun City Shadow Headquarters…
Two people were discussing intensely in the office.
“Wang Yu, it’s not good to block news regarding Mo Xiu on such a large scale. He has endured hardships for so many years and finally made a name for himself. Can’t he show off?”
Wang Yu adjusted his glasses and said, “Brother, did you forget what Elder Tang told you?”
Wang Lei thought for a moment and said, “He told us to remember to keep Mo Xiu’s secret.”
“That’s right. We don’t have to care if Mo Xiu leaves Shun City, but he’s in Shun City now. If anything happens, we won’t be able to bear the consequences.”
“But…”
“No but’s. You were the one who nurtured Mo Xiu. Don’t you know his personality? Would he care about such a trivial reputation?”
Wang Lei sighed and said, “That’s true. I just feel that this child has a tough life and should enjoy everything that he has worked hard for.”
Wang Yu said angrily, “Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been able to achieve great things. Your vision is too narrow… Hey, don’t beat me up.”
…
At night, Mo Xiu scrolled through the Shadow software in his room.
He wanted to see if there were any suitable missions to take on. After all, Mo Xiu didn’t want to waste this holiday.
There were only 15 days of vacation after the college entrance examination. Thus, Mo Xiu wanted to use this time to accumulate more wealth.
Pa!
The glass window that had just been replaced was shattered. Mo Xiu immediately got down to check. Who had provoked this window?
However, when he saw what was thrown in from outside, Mo Xiu no longer had any intention of feeling sorry for the window.
It was a shiny black medal. Wasn’t this the Shadow medal?
Mo Xiu picked it up. Then, he saw that there was indeed a name and number engraved on the back.
“Mo Xiu, 13267.”
Now that he had a medal, it would be easier for him to accept missions.
Wang Yu said that the medal was the only symbol of the Shadows. With the medal, it would be easier to carry out missions.
Mo Xiu looked for a plank to block the window.
As he did so, he mumbled, “Must the Shadows use this kind of entrance? Why can’t they just use the main entrance? Do they have to knock on the window?”
Mo Xiu lay back on the bed and continued reading through the missions.
After searching for a long time, he finally found a suitable mission. The location was in Shun City, the difficulty was suitable, and the rewards were generous.
“Investigation Mission: Underground Arena.”
“Difficulty Level: C.”
“Mission Details: Recently, an underground arena appeared in Shun City. They have been using illegal means to organize gambling and gain benefits. The mission objective is to find out who the mastermind is.”
“Reward: 2,000 points, and 800,000 yuan.”
Mo Xiu sent a message.
“Shall we take on a mission?”
Liu Ziyang said, “No problem, Boss.”
Yue Yuan replied, “Okay.”
After a long time…
Mu Qingyi replied, “Okay.”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Underground Arena
In a small park in Shun City.
The four of them sat side by side on a bench.
Mo Xiu said, “This is a mission that I’m preparing to accept. What do you guys think? If it’s possible, we can take on this mission together. I think that multiple people can complete it.”
Mu Qingyi and Liu Ziyang both expressed that they had no problem with the mission after reading it.
However, Yue Yuan frowned and said, “My family has some influence in Shun City, so I’ve heard of this arena. The law enforcement team has gone through many encirclements and suppression, but the success rate is very low. Even if they succeed, they will continue holding gambling sessions the next day.”
Mo Xiu said, “Yue Yuan, just say what you want to say.”
Yue Yuan looked at Mo Xiu and said, “The organizer is definitely not simple. He might have some foundation in Shun City and even planted spies in the law enforcement team.”
Mu Qingyi interrupted, “Is it very troublesome?”
Yue Yuan said, “It’s a little troublesome. If I’m not wrong, the difficulty of this mission should not be just Rank-C. The person behind the arena must be extremely careful.”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “I’ve thought of that too, but I’ve seen almost all the missions in Shun City and this is the most suitable one. This mission is indeed quite difficult, but what if we fight our way into the arena?”
Yue Yuan said, “Tell me more.”
Mo Xiu pointed at himself and said, “Do you guys think I look like I engage in illegal boxing?”
Liu Ziyang widened his eyes and said, “Boss, stop fooling around. You’re the top scholar of the college entrance examination. Although there’s no news of you now, who can’t find out about this?”
Meanwhile, Yue Yuan’s eyes lit up as he said, “Interesting. You’re the top scorer in the college entrance examination, but you’re from a poor family. You didn’t expose yourself for no reason after the college entrance examination and couldn’t benefit from the news. Thus, the possibility of you being suspected is very small. This plan is very interesting.”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “That’s right.”
Mu Qingyi objected, “I don’t agree. This is too dangerous.”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan looked at Mu Qingyi strangely. Was she feeling sorry for Mo Xiu? How many experts engaged in illegal boxing? After all, experts had their ways of making money. With Mo Xiu’s strength, he would definitely have no problems fitting in.
Mu Qingyi said angrily, “You’ve misunderstood what I said. I’m saying that Mo Xiu won’t be suspected, but we will be. When the time comes, only Mo Xiu will be able to infiltrate the arena, while the three of us can only provide support. If we’re discovered to be spies, it’ll be too dangerous.”
Only after Mu Qingyi said this did they react. That was right! It was indeed very dangerous for Mo Xiu to enter the enemy’s territory alone.
Mo Xiu said, “We can give it a try. I will give you guys an order based on the information I have.”
The three of them thought about how calm and mature Mo Xiu was. They felt that if they accepted this mission, this was the only way to succeed.
Mo Xiu looked at them and said seriously, “How is it? Is it decided?”
“Okay!” Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan agreed immediately.
Mu Qingyi also agreed unwillingly.
Mo Xiu said to Yue Yuan, “Yue Yuan, your family is a local tyrant. Can you help me find a contact?”
“A contact?”
“Yes, we just need to get in touch with the middle and lower levels of the arena. We have to make sure that they don’t get suspicious.”
Yue Yuan pondered for a moment before saying, “No problem, I’ll get it done right away.”
Yue Yuan was an impatient person. After receiving the order, he immediately went to do it.
Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang pointed at himself and said, “Boss, what can I do?”
Mo Xiu thought about it and said, “You can contact the law enforcement team.”
Liu Ziyang asked, “The law enforcement team? What exactly should I do?”
Mo Xiu said, “Go to the law enforcement team and find two to three people who are relatively reliable. Tell them that they are currently on a mission and need their cooperation. Don’t tell them what exaclty we are doing and maintain communication with them. Once I have any news, inform them immediately.”
Liu Ziyang thought for a while and gave him a thumbs up. “Boss, you’re really something!”
Initially, Liu Ziyang wanted to chat for a while more, but when he saw Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi exchanging glances, he instantly understood.
“Boss, I’ll do it now. I’ll let you know when I’m ready.”
Before he left, he gave Mo Xiu a knowing look.
Then, only Mu Qingyi and Mo Xiu were left. Mu Qingyi smiled at Mo Xiu.
“What about my mission?”
Mo Xiu said, “I thought you wouldn’t come this time. Why did your family agree to let you do your own thing?”
Mu Qingyi glanced at the direction Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang had left in.
“It’s because of the two of them. My father said that the two of them were worth befriending. That’s why he let me go out.”
“Oh? Then can I ask you out in their name?”
“Huh?”
Mu Qingyi did not expect Mo Xiu to suddenly speak so explicitly and was slightly flustered.
“Stop fooling around. Let’s be serious. Did you not assign me a mission because you thought that I wouldn’t come?”
“Haha, on the contrary, your mission is the most important.”
Mu Qingyi asked doubtfully, “What’s my mission?”
“Help me, and… protect me!”
…
That afternoon, Mo Xiu came to a bar. As it was still early, there were not many people in the bar.
Mo Xiu ordered a lot of wine and drank alone.
“Young man, why are you drinking so much in broad daylight?”
Mo Xiu looked up. It was a man in his thirties. He walked to his table and sat down.
“Who are you? I don’t need you to care.”
The man didn’t get angry. Instead, he smiled and said, “I’m the boss of this shop. Everyone calls me Hei Zi. If there’s anything you don’t like, just tell me. It’ll be better if you tell me.”
Mo Xiu said shakily, “Let me tell you, I’m the top scholar of this year’s college entrance examination. However, I offended someone and the news was blocked. I should be earning money every day, but there’s nothing now. How f*cking unlucky!”
When Hei Zi heard Mo Xiu’s words, he immediately perked up and whispered, “Are you really the top scorer of the college entrance examination?”
Mo Xiu rolled his eyes and said, “Go away, go away. If you don’t believe me, why are you still talking to me?”
Hei Zi immediately pulled Mo Xiu and said, “Hey, brother, I don’t mean anything else. I just feel that the top scholar is too amazing. I have a job that can allow you to earn money. Are you willing to do it?”
Mo Xiu said casually, “What job is it? I won’t do it if you don’t offer me enough money!”
“Hey, be quiet. It will definitely provide a lot of money, so much that you can’t imagine the amount.”
Mo Xiu asked suspiciously, “What job is it? How much can I earn? I’ll be leaving Shun City after school starts.”
Hei Zi looked around and whispered, “It’s illegal boxing. With just one holiday, you can probably earn millions.”
Mo Xiu’s eyes lit up, but he didn’t say anything.
Hei Zi continued, “Don’t worry, we’re very good at keeping it a secret. It won’t be known by your university. You can consider it first. If you want to do it, come here tonight at 9.30 pm.”
Mo Xiu stood up and said, “Alright. Give me the bill!”
Hei Zi hurriedly refused and said, “Hey, Little Brother, you’re treating me like an outsider. I’ll treat you today, and you can come again next time.”
Mo Xiu staggered out of the bar and hailed a cab.
The moment he entered the cab, he took out his phone and sent Yue Yuan a message.
“Everything went smoothly!”
In reality, Hei Zi was Yue Yuan’s contact. Yue Yuan had spoken to him beforehand.
Everything that happened just now was a show that the two of them put on together, just in case.
After all, the boss behind the arena had eyes everywhere. Thus, they could not leave anything suspicious behind.
At this moment, Liu Ziyang also sent a message: “Boss, the matter has been settled. We will follow the arrangements.”
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu had arranged for Liu Ziyang to contact the law enforcement team so that he would have a shield. Regardless of whether he was captured or failed the mission, he could ensure his safety.
Now that everything was arranged, they were just waiting for the big fish to take the bait.Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Bulldozer
Mo Xiu instructed a few people not to contact him and to wait for his news. The secret code was “ant”.
At nine in the evening, Mo Xiu came to the bar on time to find Hei Zi.
Hei Zi welcomed Mo Xiu warmly when he saw Mo Xiu.
“Dude, I knew you’d be here. I asked around. Your name is Mo Xiu, right?”
Mo Xiu said, “That’s right. Where is the place you mentioned? Bring me there.”
The two of them didn’t say much. Hei Zi drove Mo Xiu to the city center and finally stopped in front of a high-end hotel.
Mo Xiu didn’t expect that they would choose this place as the location of the arena. It was no wonder that the law enforcement team always returned empty-handed.
Hei Zi brought Mo Xiu to the rooftop. The rooftop was very big, and loud noises could be heard when they came up.
There were cheers, music, and screams mixed together.
Mo Xiu followed Hei Zi to a room at the edge of the rooftop.
Mo Xiu said, “Hei Zi, didn’t you say you would bring me to a boxing match?”
“Yes, but the selection of contestants here is very strict. You need to meet the people who are managing the situation.”
Mo Xiu said disdainfully, “Why do I have to go for an interview? I’m leaving then.”
Hei Zi pulled Mo Xiu and said, “Brother, we’re already here. Let’s go in and take a look.”
When they entered the room, there was only one office table. There was a person sitting and another person standing there.
Hei Zi went up and said respectfully, “Boss Fang, I brought you a contestant. Can you take a look?”
Boss Fang glanced at Mo Xiu and said, “Hei Zi, are you kidding me? This is a student, right?”
“Hey, Boss Fang, he’s indeed a student, but he’s not a simple student. He’s the top scorer of this year’s college entrance examination.”
Boss Fang sized up Mo Xiu again. The top scorer of the college entrance examination was indeed a gimmick.
“You may leave. I’ll have a private chat with this young man.”
Hei Zi walked out of the room, leaving Mo Xiu standing alone.
Mo Xiu asked, “Why? Aren’t you going to invite me to sit down?”
Boss Fang smiled apologetically and said, “Haha, little brother, I’m sorry for neglecting you. Please take a seat!”
Then, he gave a signal to his subordinate, who nodded and left.
Boss Fang said, “What’s your name? Are you really the top scholar of the college entrance examination?”
Mo Xiu turned his head and didn’t look at Boss Fang. Instead, he placed one foot on the chair.
“Yes!”
“Hmm, then why do you want to engage in illegal boxing?”
Mo Xiu glanced at Boss Fang and said, “Rubbish. I want to earn money.”
Boss Fang asked again, “You’re the top scholar of the college entrance examination. Why can’t you earn money? Why are you here?”
Mo Xiu said impatiently, “Why are you so wishy-washy? I offended someone and can’t appear on the news. Without fame, I can’t earn money. Also, I like to beat people up. I like to beat people until they can’t fight back.”
Boss Fang looked at Mo Xiu as if he was an arrogant brat.
After a while, Boss Fang’s subordinate returned with a stack of documents.
Mo Xiu knew without looking that the documents contained his information.
Boss Fang flipped through the documents seriously and nodded from time to time.
Then, Mo Xiu said, “Boss Fang, are you going to tell me if I’ve been hired or not? Can I go to the arena and practice boxing now?”
Boss Fang sized up Mo Xiu once again and said, “Alright, Mo Xiu, you can come here to practice. Come here tomorrow at 9 pm. I’ll arrange a good opponent for you.”
Mo Xiu stood up and walked out. As he walked, he said, “How boring. I thought I could go to the arena today. See you tomorrow!”
After Mo Xiu walked out of the room, one of Boss Fang’s subordinates asked, “Boss, I don’t quite understand. The information clearly says that Mo Xiu is very hardworking and calm, but his performance just now was very suspicious.”
Boss Fang picked up the documents again and said, “If his performance was normal, I wouldn’t have allowed him to practice boxing. This is what I like more.”
“Why?”
“Sometimes, a small matter is enough to drive people crazy, such as when the hard work that they have put in for a long time was not rewarded, or when they think that they are finally going to make a name for themselves but were hit in the head. Mo Xiu is such a person.”
His subordinate frowned in confusion.
Boss Fang laughed and said, “You’re good at everything, but you’re not good at reading people. The information says that Mo Xiu has been working hard since he was young, and his results have always been outstanding. It means that he has always been working hard for the college entrance examination, but he hasn’t received any returns after the examination.”
“If you had worked hard for 18 years and suddenly relaxed after achieving your goal, but didn’t get anything in return, what would you do? From the way he beat up his classmates after the college entrance examination, you can tell that he has a suppressive and violent tendency in his heart. Such a person who has lost his mind is the easiest to control.”
The subordinate was enlightened. He raised his thumb and said, “Boss, that’s great. That’s really great.”
…
Mo Xiu didn’t go home after leaving the hotel. Instead, he found a nearby bar and played for the entire night.
This was because Mo Xiu knew that the arena would definitely investigate him in secret at this time. Thus, he couldn’t give himself away.
It was impossible for Boss Fang to be the mastermind. He might not even be able to see the actual boss, so he couldn’t rush things.
The next morning, Mo Xiu brought a woman with heavy makeup out of the bar and entered a hotel.
In reality, Mo Xiu pretended to sleep the moment they entered the room and only came out at night.
Boss Fang sat in his office and asked his subordinate, “What has Mo Xiu been doing all day today?”
His subordinate replied, “He had a drink at the bar last night and brought a girl back to a hotel in the morning. This has lasted until now. Boss, you are too godly. Mo Xiu is already dispirited.”
Boss Fang said proudly, “You should learn from this. I’ll arrange for Mo Xiu to fight with Bulldozer tonight!”
His subordinate said in surprise, “Boss, Bulldozer has already achieved ten consecutive victories. Shouldn’t Mo Xiu start fighting other newcomers first?”
“That’s the plan. Just wait for the show to start.”
At 11 pm, Mo Xiu sat backstage, preparing for his first illegal boxing match.
Mo Xiu had watched a few matches from backstage. The scene was very cruel. As long as one went on stage, there were no rules and any dirty tricks could be used.
Even if one party lost consciousness, the other party would not stop. The crueler the scene, the more excited the audience would be.
This went against Mo Xiu’s beliefs. Why was there such a place?
However, after thinking about it, it made sense. The martial artists here were generally very weak. When he compared them to the competitors outside, they were like heaven and earth.
They could only use cruel competition methods to attract the audience and attract a lot of attention. Then, they could start gambling and manipulate the outcome to gain benefits.
Boss Fang patted Mo Xiu and said, “Brother, don’t take a nap. Come, it’s time for you to go into the arena.”
Mo Xiu followed behind Boss Fang and was about to go into the arena.
The emcee’s passionate voice filled the entire competition venue.
“Everyone, the finale match is coming up. Everyone should have been looking forward to it for a long time.”
“The first to enter is the person who has achieved ten consecutive victories, the person who has knocked out his opponents ten times… Bulldozer!!!”
A burly man who was about two meters tall entered the arena. His mountain-like figure matched his nickname perfectly.
The audience erupted into cheers.
“Next up is our super rookie, the college entrance examination champion… Mo Xiu!”
When the audience heard this, they started discussing. Was the top scholar of the college entrance examination here to engage in illegal boxing?
When they saw Mo Xiu appear, Mo Xiu was booed.
The Bulldozer could kill this skinny guy with one punch.
Faced with the boos from the audience, Mo Xiu gave an evil smile and raised his hands above his head as he gave the audience a thumbs up in disdain.
The crowd boiled over at this gesture.
“F*ck, this kid is not big, but he has guts. I bet everything on Bulldozer!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Blood Fist Mo Xiu
Mo Xiu’s actions mocked the entire audience. The sound of cursing filled the air.
However, Boss Fang was secretly laughing. This Mo Xiu was truly a talent. He had easily stirred up the entire atmosphere.
The emcee spoke again.
“This super rookie is really arrogant. Let me see his true strength. Both sides, get into the arena!!!”
Mo Xiu and Bulldozer both came to the stage. Bulldozer beat his chest muscles with his fists to show his strength.
Mo Xiu said disdainfully, “You’re like a gorilla. Do you think you’re very handsome?”
When Bulldozer heard Mo Xiu’s words, he simply rushed over.
The emcee immediately stopped him. “Wait a minute, wait a minute. The competition hasn’t started yet. Bulldozer is still as brave as ever.”
The process of the competition was for both parties to enter the arena first to adjust their emotions. After that, they would look at each other to increase the number of highlights in the match before the competition began.
The emcee did not want Bulldozer to break the rules, but this was good too. After all, the audience’s mood was unprecedentedly high as a result.
“Go down, trash!”
“You don’t even know how you’re going to die later, and you’re still spouting nonsense.”
“In the past, I’ve seen quite a number of academic fighters, but most of them were never seen again after one match.”
“Aw, I like this kid. He’s arrogant enough.”
“If you have the strength, then you’re arrogant. If you don’t, then you’re courting death.”
As the audience was too loud, the emcee could only raise his voice and shout, “The next two contestants are looking at each other. The competition is about to begin.”
Mo Xiu and Bulldozer stood together and looked at each other. Bulldozer glared fiercely at Mo Xiu.
On the other hand, Mo Xiu raised his head and squinted his eyes as he looked lazily at Bulldozer.
Bulldozer grew even angrier at such contempt, and his expression gradually turned savage.
Actually, Mo Xiu wasn’t as relaxed as he appeared to be. He secretly read Bulldozer’s skill.
“First Skill: Rock.”
“Skill Effect: Increases weight by 30%.”
“Duration: 3 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
“Second Skill: Hardening.”
“Skill Effect: Hardens the user’s skill and increases the user’s defense by 20%.”
“Duration: 2 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
“Third Skill: Collision.”
“Skill Effect: When the user grabs the target and falls backwards, the user’s attack power will be increased by 20% in the process.”
“Cooldown: 30 minutes.”
“Fourth Skill: Iron Fist.”
“Skill Effect: The attack power of each punch is 150% of the user’s basic attributes.”
“Cooldown: 30 minutes.”
Bulldozer was obviously over 21 years old, so he had awakened all four skills.
Overall, they were all combat skills, but the strength of his skills was very average.
However, he would still use a sledgehammer to crack a nut in this situation.Mo Xiu didn’t want to fail miserably. After all, there were no rules here. As a newcomer, he couldn’t be careless.
“The competition begins!!!”
Mo Xiu instantly activated Descent of the Martial God. Then, he stood on the ground and spread his hands.
When Bulldozer saw that Mo Xiu was still so arrogant, two rays of light flashed from his body. Then, he released his first and second skills.
He used his right arm to protect his head as he squatted down slightly and walked forward step by step.
This was Bulldozer’s usual move. He used his unparalleled weight and defense to push his opponent into a corner.
After that, he would continue to squeeze his opponent, knock his opponent down with a few punches, or end the battle with a slam.
This fighting style was also the reason for his nickname of Bulldozer.
As his fighting style was simple and brutal, there was a large number of die-hard fans in the arena.
Just when the audience thought that Mo Xiu would be pushed into a corner like Bulldozer’s previous opponents, Mo Xiu’s actions shocked everyone.
Mo Xiu stretched out his right hand and placed it on Bulldozer’s right arm. Then, Bulldozer could no longer move forward.
The noisy crowd gradually quieted down as everyone watched this scene in disbelief.
The reason for this was because this scene was simply too bizarre.
An ordinary high school student had used one hand to block the hill-sized Bulldozer.
Meanwhile, Bulldozer looked like he was still struggling and was constantly exerting force.
Mo Xiu said, “Don’t waste your energy. You can’t push me. How can you call yourself a Bulldozer with such little strength?”
Bulldozer was quite powerful. If Mo Xiu didn’t use any skills, Bulldozer’s strength and weight should be enough to push Mo Xiu.
However, after Mo Xiu’s attributes were enhanced by his skills, it was different. Mo Xiu was already very strong. Furthermore, with the 300% increase in attributes from Descent of the Martial God, he was able to defeat Bulldozer, who was most proud of his strength.
At this moment, Bulldozer stopped in his tracks and looked at Mo Xiu in disbelief.
Then, he took a step back and activated his fourth skill, Iron Fist.
Mo Xiu raised his arms to protect his head. The five punches landed solidly on Mo Xiu’s arms.
The audience felt that Mo Xiu was being overconfident. It was one thing to be strong, but it was another to be able to withstand attacks.
At this moment, Mo Xiu didn’t choose to dodge. Instead, he took the hit head-on. Even if he wasn’t injured, he would be severely injured by the impact of the punch.
However, only the Bulldozer knew how scary Mo Xiu was. Mo Xiu didn’t move at all.
Then, Bulldozer lowered his fist and took a few steps back. He now knew that their strengths were not on the same level.
His killer move was unable to cause any damage to Mo Xiu. Thus, he already had thoughts of giving up.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu stood up straight and said, “Are you done? If you’re done, it’ll be my turn.”
Bulldozer opened his mouth, but no words came out.
Mo Xiu’s fighting style was very simple. It was the same as when he was fighting Wang Xuanhu. It was simple, brutal, and merciless.
However, Bulldozer did not have Wang Xuanhu’s defense. Thus, he fell to the ground after just one punch.
Mo Xiu didn’t stop. He went forward and punched him two more times. Then, he looked up at the emcee, who didn’t have any intention of stopping the competition.
Thus, Mo Xiu had no choice but to keep fighting. He punched faster, his fists raining down on Bulldozer.
The emcee originally thought that Mo Xiu would show off to the audience. Thus, the emcee planned to stop the competition after a few punches.
However, looking at Mo Xiu’s stance, it was obvious that he was going all out. Thus, the emcee immediately stopped the competition.
“Mo Xiu wins. Mo Xiu, please stop.”
When Mo Xiu heard the emcee’s voice, he continued punching twice before stopping. Then, he slowly stood up with an indifferent gaze.
At this moment, all the spectators noticed that Mo Xiu’s hands were blood-red. Wasn’t this too brutal?
In reality, Mo Xiu had held back. If he had used his full strength, Bulldozer would have died.
Mo Xiu didn’t interact with the audience and walked straight to the backstage.
Boss Fang’s attitude changed a lot. He said ingratiatingly, “Mo Xiu, you’re the best. Keep it up and conquer this place.”
Mo Xiu said nonchalantly, “How much can I get for this match?”
Boss Fang took out a few stacks of money and placed them in front of Mo Xiu. He said, “You are a newcomer, so you’ll get a little less money. This is a total of 30,000 yuan.”
Mo Xiu frowned. He could actually earn so much money from one match. Money came too quickly. It was no wonder so many people were willing to come here to practice.
Seeing Mo Xiu frown, Boss Fang thought that Mo Xiu was unhappy and immediately explained.
“Mo Xiu, don’t be anxious. You performed very well today. In the future, as long as you get more attention, it will be easy to earn money.”
Mo Xiu lowered his head and said, “Alright, I’ll believe you for now. If the benefits aren’t enough, I might not work with you anymore.”
Mo Xiu had already understood that Boss Fang wasn’t a high-leveled executive behind the scenes. He was just a manager who recruited fighters.
After this match, he became famous. Mo Xiu believed that many people would try to poach him.
Boss Fang smiled and said, “In that case, let’s not treat each other as outsiders. I’ve arranged a hotel for you. Go back and rest.”
Mo Xiu left, but the underground arena was in an uproar. A heavyweight fighter had appeared out of nowhere.
His nickname was… Blood Fist!Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Newcomer King Mo Xiu
The hotel that Boss Fang had arranged for them to stay at was the hotel where the arena was located. They could just take the elevator down.
Mo Xiu returned to his room and took a quick shower before lying back on the bed.
Then, he sent a message to Mu Qingyi, Yue Yuan, and Liu Ziyang.
“Ant, on the rooftop of Sky Treasure Hotel. Don’t act rashly.”
According to the plan, Mo Xiu sent them a message. Unless there was a problem, they didn’t need to reply.
However, Mo Xiu received a reply as soon as he sent the message.
“Did you have a good time at the hotel today?”
The message was sent by Mu Qingyi, so he understood immediately.
Mu Qingyi was probably referring to the fact that he had brought a woman to a hotel and did not come out for a day.
Mo Xiu smiled and shook his head before replying.
“I slept for the whole day. Why? Are you jealous?”
Mo Xiu did not explain himself. He only said that he had slept for the whole day.
After a while, Mu Qingyi replied, “Ant received!”
What Mo Xiu did not expect was that Mu Qingyi was currently looking at her phone and scolding Mo Xiu for being a hooligan.
Looking at the time, it was already past 11 pm. Just as Mo Xiu was preparing to sleep, the door rang.
Mo Xiu became alert. Who could it be at this hour?
When he opened the door, he saw two scantily clad women.
Mo Xiu frowned and asked, “Who are you?”
One of the older women said, “We were sent by Boss Fang to serve you. Do you want us to go in?”
Mo Xiu said coldly, “Go back and tell Boss Fang that what I want is money. Don’t mess this up.”
Bam! The door closed.
After the door closed, the younger woman asked, “Sis, how are we going to explain ourselves when we get back?”
“What else can we say? We can only tell Boss Fang the truth. He didn’t even let us talk much. If we knock on the door again, we might anger him. Let’s go!”
Mo Xiu returned to his bed again and carefully thought about what he could do to make use of Boss Fang, as well as what methods he could use to get closer to the higher-ups.
After pondering for a moment, Mo Xiu smiled and picked up the money Boss Fang had given him.
“It seems like I have to make a big deal out of this. Furthermore, I can also earn money. Why not do this?”
…
The next morning, Mo Xun wanted to go out for a walk but was stopped by Boss Fang’s subordinate.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Mo. You can’t go out.”
Mo Xiu ignored him and walked past him. This person stretched out his hand, wanting to stop Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu grabbed his hand and pushed him down.
A golden light flashed across the subordinate’s body. Clearly, he had activated a skill.
Mo Xiu had already learned the skills of this subordinate and Boss Fang during their first meeting.
Boss Fang had an auxiliary skill, while this person mostly had investigative skills and only one skill that increased his attack power. Thus, it was impossible for him to defeat Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu snorted and said, “Hmph! Do you want to try fighting with me? It just so happens that I have nothing better to do.”
With that said, Mo Xiu twisted his neck, looking like he was about to fight.
Just then, Boss Fang ran over.
“Nonsense, how can you be so rude to Mo Xiu? Get lost.”
His subordinate ran off without another word. Mo Xiu was a little disappointed to see him run off.
“Boss Fang, what do you mean? When I first arrived, you didn’t say that you wanted to restrict my freedom.”
Boss Fang immediately replied, “Mo Xiu, didn’t you perform too well yesterday? If you go out now, you’ll definitely be targeted.”
Mo Xiu said impatiently, “Boss Fang, do you think I’m an idiot? If something is the matter, just say it.”
Seeing that Mo Xiu wasn’t easy to fool, Boss Fang invited Mo Xiu to his room and started explaining.
“Mo Xiu, I’m actually just a small fry. I’m in charge of selecting the boxers. I’ve received orders that everyone under me cannot leave the hotel today. I have no choice.”
Mo Xiu said, “Then get someone above you to talk to me!”
Boss Fang said many comforting words to Mo Xiu and explained many things. Finally, Mo Xiu reluctantly returned to his room.
After this conversation, Mo Xiu also understood the management of the arena.
The classification of ranks was very clear. People like Hei Zi would select boxers and hand them over to a manager like Boss Fang. If a boxer could be hired, Hei Zi would get a commission.
Meanwhile, Boss Fang had to listen to his superior’s orders. His superior would tell him when competitions would be held, when the boxers could go out, and when they could not go out.
When a boxer reached a certain level of fame, they would be upgraded to the rank of a King Boxer.
The King Boxers were jointly managed by a higher level of the management, who arranged the so-called King’s War.
Regardless of whether it was the amount of attention paid to the King’s War or the amount of bets placed, it was not something that ordinary matches could compare to.
Mo Xiu suspected that Boss Fang was definitely not the boss behind the arena. However, once he came into contact with the boss, he would be closer to the truth.
…
That night, Boss Fang asked Mo Xiu if he had any objections to participating in two matches.
Mo Xiu replied, “I have no objections. It’s best if I fight every match. I’m here to earn money!”
The two opponents in this competition were not as strong as Bulldozer, and Mo Xiu easily won. Of course, there was also the beating after his victory and the scarlet fists that resulted after.
This time, he had finally established his reputation as Blood Fist. All the audience knew that there was a college entrance examination champion in the underground arena called Blood Fist.
On the third day, Mo Xiu fought against five contestants and won all of the matches!
On the fourth day, Mo Xiu fought against nine contestants and won all of the matches!
On the fifth day, Mo Xiu fought against seven contestants and won all of the matches!
Mo Xiu had won a total of 24 matches since his debut, and all of them had been great victories. No one had been able to hurt Mo Xiu at all.
Mo Xiu was naturally referred to as the Newcomer King by others. Due to his dazzling achievements, he was promoted to the rank of King Boxer.
Every King Boxer had to fight one battle after another, and they had to go through dozens of battles before they were able to advance. However, Mo Xiu only took five days.
Today was the sixth day since he had arrived here. Mo Xiu sighed. It was truly easy to lose oneself in the rapidly growing wealth and the cheers of the audience during the battle.
In just five days and 24 matches, Mo Xiu had earned 1.53 million yuan. This time, the mission reward was only 800,000 yuan. Furthermore, the reward would be shared among four people.
It was no wonder that the laws of the Alliance were so strict. There were always people who took the risk to do illegal things to profit.
The profits were simply too shocking. After all, Mo Xiu was only a boxer. The boss behind this arena would probably earn countless amounts of money every match.
Knock, knock, knock!
There was a knock on the door, and Mo Xiu knew that what was supposed to come had finally come.
When Mo Xiu opened the door, he saw Boss Fang say with a respectful expression. “Mo Xiu, congratulations on advancing to the rank of King Boxer. From now on, you’re no longer under my jurisdiction. It’s such a pity. When I worked with you. I…”
Mo Xiu angrily interrupted Boss Fang and said, “Alright, we’re already so close. Just tell me how much you earned!”
Boss Fang smiled and said, “Hahaha, I didn’t earn as much as you. Let’s go.”
Then, Boss Fang brought Mo Xiu to a room in the hotel.
Mo Xiu was a little puzzled. Could the entire organization be in this hotel?
Boss Fang said softly, “Mo Xiu, go in. I won’t go in. The person inside is called Xue Jin. He’s the person in charge of the entire arena.”
After knocking on the door a few times, the door opened. It was a middle-aged man in his forties.
Mo Xiu did not hold back after entering. He found a chair and sat down.
“Are you the person-in-charge here? How much can you pay me if you arrange a King’s War for me?”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!

                    



Xue Jin
The middle-aged man was not angered by Mo Xiu’s rudeness. Instead, he returned to the table and sat down before speaking.
“Let me introduce myself. My name is Xue Jin, and I am indeed the most powerful person here. As for how much money you can earn, it all depends on you.”
Mo Xiu frowned. “What do you mean? Speak clearly!”
Xue Jin replied, “After you become a King Boxer, you will become one of us. Without a fixed appearance fee, how much you can take depends on how much we earn.”
Mo Xiu lowered his head in silence.
Xue Jin laughed loudly. “Hahaha, don’t worry. As long as you are obedient, you will only earn more than before.”
“As long as I’m obedient? What does that mean?”
“I know that you are very strong. You can always win competitions in the early stages. However, we will arrange for you to lose a few matches occasionally. Do you understand?”
Mo Xiu stood up unhappily and turned to leave. As he walked, he said, “I won’t lose.”
After Mo Xiu left, Xue Jin leaned back in his chair.
He muttered to himself, “There’s no one I can’t control. No one can resist all of their desires!”
Before Mo Xiu had come, he had known that the underground arena would make profits through fake fights. He had left this time because he wanted Xue Jin to take the initiative to find him. This would allow him to obtain more useful information.
After returning to his room, Mo Xiu sent Xue Jin’s name and physical characteristics to Mu Qingyi and the others.
Half an hour later, Mo Xiu received a reply from Yue Yuan.
“Xue Jin is one of the more famous freelance investors in Shun City. He has many shares in many companies under his name and has 5% shares in Sky Treasure Hotel.”
After finding Hei Zi, Yue Yuan was also in charge of gathering intelligence. Occasionally, he would tell Mo Xiu about the latest information.
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but marvel at Yue Yuan’s efficiency. He had managed to find out everything within half an hour.
However, Mo Xiu found it a little strange. As the person in charge of the arena, Xue Jin actually revealed his real name to others. Wasn’t he afraid that the law enforcement team would find out?
While he was thinking, his phone rang. This time, it was Liu Ziyang.
“Boss, Xue Jin has been suspected of being related to the arena many times, but the law enforcement team has no evidence. In addition, Xue Jin’s prestige in Shun City is rather high, so the law enforcement team can’t detain him for long.”
Mo Xiu understood. This was a formidable person. There was nothing he could do even if the law enforcement team came.
Finally, Mu Qingyi sent a message.
“What should I do?”
Mo Xio thought for a moment and smiled strangely.
“Do me a favor. I have 1.53 million yuan here. You…”
Mo Xiu waited for a day. When it was finally close to night, he was told to go to Xue Jin’s room.
The moment Xue Jin’s door opened, Mo Xiu was stunned. It was unlike the time in the morning when Xue Jin was alone.
This time, there were seven or eight people working in the room, making the spacious room especially crowded.
Mo Xiu said casually, “Boss, I’m here. Why are you looking for me?”
Xue Jin tossed a document to Mo Xiu and said, “You have a King’s War scheduled for tonight. Go and prepare. This is the opponent’s information. You can win tonight.”
Mo Xiu threw the documents on the ground and said, “I don’t like people ordering me around. I can win if I want to and lose if I want to.”
Xue Jin did not raise his head. He was still busy with his work and handed Mo Xiu a piece of paper, saying, “This is the expected reward for winning tonight.”
When Xue Jin handed him the piece of paper, Mo Xiu activated God’s Eye.
“First Skill: Voice Transformation 2.”
“Skill Effect: Changes the user’s voice to a desired voice.”
“Second Skill: Reflex 2.”
“Skill Effect: The user cannot be recorded by any equipment.”
“Third Skill: Perception 2.”
“Skill Effect: The user can sense the detection-type skills that others use on you and lock onto their target.”
“Fourth Skill: Charge 2.”
“Skill Effect: Increases speed by 500%.”
“Duration: One minute.”
“Cooldown: One hour.”
Xue Jin seemed to have sensed something. He suddenly raised his head and looked around before looking at Mo Xiu in confusion.
“I still have things to do. You can go back first.”
Xue Jin could clearly sense that someone was investigating him, but he could not lock onto the other party. This was the first time such a situation had happened in so many years.
Mo Xiu suppressed the nervousness in his heart and said, “Alright, I want to keep winning.”
After saying that, he turned around and left. The moment he left, Mo Xiu took a deep breath.
This Xue Jin was simply a freak. Out of the four skills, he had three anti-detection skills that did not have a cooldown time, while the last skill was an escape skill.
He could change his voice and was not afraid of being recorded. Furthermore, others could not take photographs of him or investigate him. This way, it was no wonder that the law-enforcement team could not find any evidence. He was simply a natural lawbreaker.
Moreover, Xue Jin’s skills were all at Level-2. This was too abnormal. Mo Xiu wasn’t sure if he had been exposed.
Xue Jin’s third skills could allow him to lock onto the person investigating him, but looking at his reaction just now, it did not seem like he had discovered Mo Xiu.
After returning to his room, Mo Xiu decided to continue his mission.
Xue Jin did not seem to be faking it just now. He must have discovered someone investigating for some reason but could not lock onto the target.
It took a while for Mo Xiu to recall the piece of paper Xue Jin had given him. When he looked at it, Mo Xiu was frightened.
It listed the payment that Mo Xiu would receive tonight.
“Ticket shares: 80,000 yuan.”
“Expected tips: 350,000 yuan.”
“Estimated revenue from bets: One million yuan.”
The remuneration for a match was actually more than one million. This was too exaggerated.
While he was shocked, Mo Xiu also scolded the person who assigned the mission to the Shadows.
How did such a mission only have a reward of 800,000 yuan?
Mo Xiu calmed down and understood Xue Jin’s intentions. He wanted to use money to make Mo Xiu obedient.
There were a total of three sources of revenue on this piece of paper. Two of them were estimated, which meant that this piece of paper should have been given to the contestants after the competition.
However, the reason Xue Jin had given it to Mo Xiu was to tell Mo Xiu that the profits were large enough. If he was obedient, he would earn even more in the future.
Mo Xiu sent a message to Mu Qingyi and the other two, telling them to investigate Xue Jin properly.
It was very likely that Xue Jin was the boss behind this.
With the way he did things, the skill and ease he had shown while he was busy, his shares in the Sky Treasure Hotel, and his extremely powerful anti-detection skills, Xue Jin definitely had the ability to organize such an arena.
In that case, would he still need someone to rely on? Would he still have to risk his life for others?
When Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang received Mo Xiu’s message, they suggested that they inform the law enforcement team directly. Even if they didn’t have any evidence, they could at least arrest the culprit, right?
Mu Qingyi did not say anything and listened to Mo Xiu’s arrangements.
Mo Xiu decided to wait. He felt that this matter was too simple.
…
At 10 pm…
“Today’s finale is a King’s War. Sparta, whom everyone has been looking forward to, will be participating today. Sparta has not lost in two months and has only lost once in his career…”
In the arena, the emcee was introducing the battle results of a boxer nicknamed Sparta, who was warming up for a match as usual.
Mo Xiu sat backstage and did not see Xue Jin. Could it be that Xue Jin would not come to watch the competition?
“Who’s Sparta’s opponent? You should have guessed by now.”
Everyone shouted in unison, “Blood Fist! Blood Fist! Blood Fist!”
In fact, a promotion had been done before the tickets were sold. Thus, everyone knew about the battle tonight. The reason why the emcee said this was to stir up the audience’s emotions.
“That’s right, the other contestant today is the Newcomer King who has achieved 24 victories in five days… Blood Fist!!!”
Upon hearing the emcee call his name, Mo Xiu stood up and walked towards the stage.
Sparta was a middle-aged man in his forties or fifties. His body was strong, and all four skills increased his attributes.
Xue Jin had probably arranged this match because he felt that Sparta and Mo Xiu’s competition methods were similar. It would be a very interesting match.

Each Person Will Receive 20,000 Yuan
Mo Xiu continued to look at his opponent nonchalantly.
Sparta, who was standing opposite him, was not as angry as Bulldozer. Instead, he looked calmly at Mo Xiu.
This was different from Mo Xiu’s previous matches. This time, the audience was not one-sided. Instead, each side had their own supporters.
Mo Xiu had fewer supporters. This was probably why Xue Jin had let Mo Xiu win.
“The competition begins!!!”
“Ah!!!”
Sparta roared, and his body grew larger. It seemed that he had unleashed all his skills.
Meanwhile, a golden glow appeared on Mo Xiu’s body as he activated Descent of the Martial God.
Then, he rushed forward and threw a punch. Sparta was not to be outdone and also threw a punch.
The two fists collided. Sparta clutched his right hand and fell to his knees in pain.
He looked at Mo Xiu in disbelief and said, “Impossible, impossible! How can you be so strong?”
Mo Xiu frowned slightly. He hadn’t used his full strength in that punch just now. The two punches were evenly matched, so why was this person in so much pain?
Mo Xiu looked around the arena and saw Xue Jin at the center.
Xue Jin was smiling at him. So that was the case!
Mo Xiu had thought that the contestants in the King’s War would be stronger and more difficult to deal with.
However, from the looks of it now, the King’s War was simply a joke. It wasn’t a competition of strength but acting skills.
Mo Xiu didn’t have any interest in continuing the battle. He wanted to get off the stage and continue acting arrogant.
However, after thinking about it, he stopped. Mo Xiu raised his fists and beat Sparta like he did in the first 24 matches.
Just like that, the match that the audience had been looking forward to ended without any suspense.
After the competition ended, Mo Xiu returned to his room.
At midnight, Mo Xiu went to find Xue Jin to settle scores.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Mo Xiu knocked on the door as though he was venting his emotions.
Xue Jin opened the door and smiled. “Come in. I’m waiting for you.”
After entering the room, Mo Xiu realized that there was another person inside. It was a man in his fifties or sixties. What was he calculating? He didn’t notice Mo Xiu entering at all.
This man’s name was Zhang Siyuan, Xue Jin’s accountant.
Suddenly, Zhang Siyuan said, “Boss, the profits have been calculated.”
After handing a document to Xue Jin, Xue Jin casually placed it on the table.
Even though Xue Jin was very careful, Mo Xiu still saw that the profits were three million yuan.
Mo Xiu was the first to speak. “Boss Xue, you’re being a little too unreasonable. Why did you let my opponent go easy on me? Do you think I can’t beat him?”
Boss Xue threw Mo Xiu a card and said, “This is your reward. It’s a little more than what we planned.”
Mo Xiu asked, “How much is that?”
“You’ll get 1.8 million yuan!”
Mo Xiu was shocked, not because he had never seen money before.
It was because Xue Jin had given him 1.8 million yuan, but the profit was only three million yuan.
Mo Xiu would never believe that Xue Jin would give him half of his profits.
He would not be the only one in this competition. Sparta would also get a share.
If the profits Mo Xiu had just seen were real, then what did Xue Jin rely on to earn money?
Mo Xiu was thinking quickly, but in Xue Jin’s eyes, Mo Xiu was scared silly.
“What’s wrong, Mo Xiu? Don’t be agitated. This money is all yours. Go back to your room. I’ve prepared a gift for you.”
Mo Xiu nodded and walked back to his room in a daze.
The moment he entered, he saw two women lying on his bed.
Mo Xiu closed the door and smiled at the two women.
…
The next morning, two women sat in Xue Jin’s office. They were the two who had appeared in Mo Xiu’s room last night.
Xue Jin asked, “Are you telling me that Mo Xiu didn’t reject you yesterday? Tell me what he did yesterday. Be more detailed!”
The two girls chimed in, “This young man is really healthy. He carried us to the bed the moment he came in.”
“That’s right. He looks young but has a big appetite. He was definitely going to eat us both.”
“That’s right, that’s right. His health is really good.”
“His body is really good. Yesterday, he even…”
Xue Jin interrupted, “Alright, there’s no need to say anymore. You guys can leave!”
Xue Jin smiled and muttered to himself, “Mo Xiu is just a child. He should slowly lose himself in his desires!”
That night, Mo Xiu conducted another King’s War. As expected, it was arranged by Xue Jin, and Mo Xiu easily won.
Mo Xiu’s income was still 1.8 million yuan this time. However, the rewards and tickets shares had increased, while his revenue from bets had decreased.
When Mo Xiu returned to his room, there were two more beauties.
This time, Mo Xiu went straight to Xue Jin and caused a huge ruckus. He insisted on looking for the two women from the previous night. He even said that they were acquaintances and cooperated well.
Xue Jin did not know whether to laugh or cry. He could only find those two women and instruct them to stay by Mo Xiu’s side.
Mo Xiu’s actions made Xue Jin believe that Mo Xiu was easy to control.
Then, Mo Xiu brought the two women back to his room.
The moment Mo Xiu entered the room, he took out two stacks of cash and threw them on the table.
“We’ll follow the same old rules. Each person will receive 20,000 yuan. You can earn as long as I stay here.”
Upon hearing Mo Xiu’s words, the two girls immediately came over to take their share.
One of the women asked, “Brother Blood Fist, are you really not good in that aspect? You look so brave and fierce, but it doesn’t seem like it!”
Mo Xiu glared at the woman and said, “Don’t mention this again. This is my weakness. Don’t blame me for being impolite.”
Another woman chimed in, “We feel bad taking 20,000 yuan for free every day. Why don’t we help you shower?”
Mo Xiu laughed strangely. “Hehe, there’s no need. After I realized that I’m not good at that, I think I prefer men.”
The two women were shocked and stopped talking.
In reality, the night before, Mo Xiu had already told the two girls that he had some flaws in some aspects. They were not allowed to speak of this scandal.
If they helped Mo Xiu keep the secret, they would each receive 20,000 yuan.
At first, the two girls didn’t really believe it. However, Mo Xiu later told them that not only could they not say that he was no good to outsiders, they also had to say that he was very good.
The two girls immediately understood Mo Xiu’s thoughts and agreed immediately. That was why they had the conversation with Xue Jin.
…
It was the eighth day since Mo Xiu arrived.
It was still a great victory. This time, after Mo Xiu won, he didn’t immediately return backstage. Instead, he interacted with the audience and stirred up their emotions.
This was Xue Jin’s instructions. This was the first time Mo Xiu had been obedient.
That day, his income was 1.2 million. His ticket shares and tips were still increasing. However, his revenue from bets was zero, which meant that Xue Jin was already starting to lose money.
On the ninth day.
Mo Xiu was arranged to fight against Hades, who had the highest points among the King Boxers.
Mo Xiu had thought that Xue Jin would make him lose this round, but he did not expect that Xue Jin would order him to win.
Xue Jin had great plans. He wanted to make Mo Xiu an undefeated legend, and then make Mo Xiu lose another match. At that time, all the money he had lost would be returned, and he would make a fortune.
Mo Xiu won this match again, but it was not easy. Xue Jin had arranged for this match to last for half an hour.
Meanwhile, the audience witnessed the birth of the new king of the arena. It only took nine days.
Even so, Mo Xiu cooperated from beginning to end.
Xue Jin knew that Mo Xiu had already become his money-making tool and had no other thoughts.
He had earned 1.35 million yuan today, but the return from bets was still zero.
When Mo Xiu returned to his room, the two women were still in his room.
Mo Xiu secretly sent a message to Mu Qingyi and the other two.
“Ants, prepare to draw in your nets!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!

                    



Drawing in the Net (1)
Today was the tenth day since Mo Xiu arrived at the arena.
Within ten days, Mo Xiu went from a student who had been booed in the arena, to the King of the underground arena that everyone knew.
He enjoyed the cheers in the arena every day and became the undefeated legend of the people… Blood Fist.
Early in the morning, Xue Jin called Mo Xiu over.
“Mo Xiu, how have you been these past few days?”
Mo Xiu said excitedly, “I’ve been great! I’ve never received so much money or enjoyed such a life.”
Xue Jin was very satisfied with Mo Xiu’s answer. “Not bad. However, the remuneration for the past few days has not increased. What do you think of this?”
Mo Xiu said nonchalantly, “It’s fine. I already have a lot of money. I just need to maintain the status quo.”
After hearing Mo Xiu’s words, Xue Jin said with a disappointed expression, “Mo Xiu, where’s your drive when you first came here? How can you be content with the current situation? Wouldn’t it be good to obtain more money to go to university?”
Mo Xiu spread out his hands and said, “I don’t lack anything now, so why do I still need to go to university? Isn’t the point of going to university just to live like this? I already have it!”
Xue Jin knew that Mo Xiu had completely fallen into his hands. He was content with the current situation and obeyed orders.
“Look at this!”
Mo Xiu took the document that Xue Jin handed to him and opened the first page. His expected rewards were written on it.
“Ticket revenue: 200,000 yuan.”
“Revenue from expected tips: 500,000 yuan.”
“Estimated revenue from bets: 10 million yuan.”
Mo Xiu suddenly looked up at Xue Jin, his eyes filled with disbelief.
“Boss Xue, what… What is happening here?”
Xue Jin stood up and patted Mo Xiu’s shoulder.
“If you want to lose tonight, you’ll get this amount of money, perhaps even more.”
Mo Xiu frowned and said, “But… But I just became the new king of the underground arena. This is when I…”
Xue Jin laughed loudly. Mo Xiu’s words at this moment meant that he no longer resisted losing the competition.
“Mo Xiu, after you lose this round, take the money and have fun outside for a few days. When you come back, I will arrange for your winning streak.”
Mo Xiu said reluctantly, “But what about my fans? If I lose, they won’t support me anymore.”
Xue Jin said meaningfully, “Do you think that the audience likes to see the king undefeated without a doubt, or do you think they prefer seeing the king coming back to destroy any doubts?”
A glint flashed across Mo Xiu’s eyes. After some thought, he said, “Alright, I’ll lose tonight. What’s the script like?”
“The document I gave you just now is followed by the script. Go back and prepare well.”
Mo Xiu nodded and left the room without another word.
Xue Jin leaned back in his chair and made a call.
“It’s ready.”
“Don’t worry, Mo Xiu is still under control. He’s just a student.”
Mo Xiu did not return to his room. Instead, he kept walking along the corridor. After a long time, he saw an acquaintance walk out of their room. Only then did he return to his own room.
Then, he sent a message to Yue Yuan.
“Ant, check the specific gambling methods of the underground arena.”
Ten minutes later.
“The gambling method is a little special. All audience members who enter the venue must use their real names and provide the arena with a bank account number. After entering the venue, the audience members can place their bets in the special software used in the arena. The results of the competition and the bet will be automatically settled by the software. After the competition ends, the first thing the arena needs to do is to transfer the winnings into the audience’s accounts via an anonymous account. The money will be transferred to the accounts in real time.”
Mo Xiu finally understood why very few people reported the arena to the authorities even though there were so many people in the audience. The reason was because of the system.
The arena transferred the winnings to the audience’s accounts in real time to restrict and fix their customer base. It was unknown who came up with this operation method.
Mo Xiu sent a message to Mu Qingyi, Yue Yuan, and Liu Ziyang.
“Ants, draw in the nets tonight. The plan is as follows…”
…
At the rooftop of the Sky Treasure Hotel.
“Tonight is the first battle after the new king of the arena has ascended to the throne. Do I need to introduce Blood Fist to everyone?”
Everyone cheered.
“No need!!!”
“Blood Fist! Blood Fist! Blood Fist!”
The emcee gestured for the audience to quiet down.
“Everyone, calm down. I have yet to introduce his opponent. Blood Fist’s opponent is a new King Boxer, Silver Warrior. He has unparalleled speed and can often win by surprise.”
The audience became noisy again.
“What the heck? Silver Warrior fought almost 200 matches before he advanced to become a King Boxer. There’s no competition at all.”
“I reckon Blood Fist will be done in one punch. There’s no suspense at all.”
“Blood Fist, I will bet everything on your victory.”
The emcee could not control the emotions of the audience and could only shout loudly.
“Let us welcome both parties into the arena. The first is Silver Warrior!”
The crowd booed even louder than the first time Mo Xiu went on stage. Silver Warrior practically walked up the stage with his head lowered.
“Next is the king, Blood Fist!”
The entire audience erupted into a sea of cheers.
Mo Xiu was in no hurry. He slowly walked towards the competition venue.
During this time, he made a lot of interactions with the audience. While walking to the arena, he took off his cloak and threw it at the spectators.
After arrogantly walking onto the stage, Mo Xiu leaned against the edge of the stage and greeted the audience, completely disregarding his opponent.
In the next segment where both sides looked at each other, Mo Xiu was even more aggressive. He walked forward as he watched and was warned many times by the emcee.
Meanwhile, Silver Warrior was a little timid and kept retreating, not daring to look at Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu shouted loudly, “Silver Warrior, was it? I think you should go down, lest you get seriously injured and can’t fight in the future.”
The mood in the venue was raised to the highest point. Then, the emcee gave the order for the competition to begin.
“Begin!”
…
At the same time, Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang sneaked into Sky Treasure Hotel.
“Old Yue, do you think Boss Mo Xiu’s plan will work? Isn’t it a little too hasty to draw in the net now?”
Yue Yuan said angrily, “If you want to leave, sure. You can be the boss. If not, follow the plan. How’s the law enforcement team doing?”
Liu Ziyang said smugly, “Boss has instructed me to contact the law enforcement team. I’ve been constantly testing these few days and finally found someone I can trust completely. Just watch carefully.”
Yue Yuan nodded. Although Liu Ziyang was usually cheerful, he was also an extremely serious person at crucial moments.
…
When the match began, Mo Xiu did not even activate his skill. He just quietly looked at Silver Warrior and made an inviting gesture.
Silver Warrior gritted his teeth and activated his skill to charge towards Mo Xiu.
At this moment, Mo Xiu used his skill and kicked Silver Warrior.
Silver Warrior was kicked and retreated to the edge of the field before stopping.
Then, he looked warily at Mo Xiu. Seeing that Mo Xiu did not make any further moves, Silver Warrior rushed forward again.
With a simple punch, Mo Xiu knocked Silver Warrior back again. After that, Silver Warrior rushed forward again.
This continued for more than ten times. Mo Xiu stood firmly on the spot, while Silver Warrior was sweating profusely from running back and forth.
Xue Jin, who was sitting in the front row, nodded. Mo Xiu had done well. Everything was going according to the script.
After a few more moves, Mo Xiu seemed to have lost interest in playing and took the initiative to attack.
However, since Silver Warrior was too fast, Mo Xiu couldn’t hit him.
After a few minutes of chasing, Mo Xiu forced Silver Warrior into a corner and punched him.
Below the stage, Xue Jin’s lips curled up slightly. According to the script, Silver Warrior should quickly move behind Mo Xiu and deal a critical hit. After that, the battle would turn around. Then, Mo Xiu would be defeated after being unable to resist.
Mo Xiu punched out and Silver Warrior disappeared before quickly appearing behind Mo Xiu.
Everyone thought that Mo Xiu would definitely be hit by this attack, including Xue Jin.
However, no one expected Mo Xiu to suddenly turn around and use his full strength with his right fist. Everyone present heard the sound of the wind breaking from this punch as it directly hit Silver Warrior on the back.Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com.

Drawing in the Net (2)
Silver Warrior was directly hit to the ground as a deep pit appeared on the ground.
Xue Jin could no longer remain calm when he saw this. He slammed the table and stood up, staring at Mo Xiu in disbelief.
Mo Xiu also turned to look at Xue Jin with a smile on his face, appearing very polite.
Xue Jin shuddered when he saw Mo Xiu’s smile. What exactly was going on?
The emcee did not react to the sudden end of the competition. After a short moment of shock, he immediately announced the results.
“The Blood Fist didn’t disappoint and won easily!”
Text message notifications resounded throughout the entire venue. They had received the rewards from betting.
Anyone who wasn’t an idiot would bet on Mo Xiu winning this match, so the audience was extremely excited.
The entire arena was in an uproar. The overwhelming cheers made it impossible to hear anything else.
At this moment, Xue Jin’s phone rang. He glanced at it before answering the call. Then, he lowered his head and said something as he walked towards the backstage.
Mo Xiu jumped off the stage and stopped Xue Jin.
Xue Jin roared, “Mo Xiu! Get out of my way! I’ll settle your matter later!”
The four or five people beside Xue Jin stood in front of Mo Xiu, protecting him as he left.
Mo Xiu raised his right hand to his head.
Xue Jin was somewhat puzzled as he held the phone. What was he doing? He looked like he was greeting someone.
The next moment, something unexpected happened.
A flying knife dagger out of thin air behind Xue Jin. As it spun, the back of the dagger hit the phone.
Xue Jin was caught off guard and the phone was sent flying. Then, the phone flew through the air in a perfect arc before landing in Mo Xiu’s hand.
Mo Xiu placed the phone to his ear and heard a voice coming from it.
“Hey! Hey! What happened? You have to make up for today’s loss.”
Mo Xiu replied, “I can make up for it, but… I’ve found you.”
Just as Xue Jin was about to order his men to snatch the phone back, another flying dagger appeared in the air and blocked their escape route. Mo Xiu took the opportunity to slip away.
The one who threw the flying dagger to cover Mo Xiu was naturally Mu Qingyi.
Mu Qingyi had always been in the arena. In fact, Mu Qingyi was present in every match that Mo Xiu appeared in.
It was also Mu Qingyi who had used her skill to snatch Xue Jin’s phone.
The mission Mo Xiu had assigned Mu Qingyi at the start was to enter the competition grounds to provide Mo Xiu with support.
Thus, the person who had been closest to Mo Xiu all this time was Mu Qingyi.
Mu Qingyi was unable to infiltrate the enemy, but her identity and background allowed her to enter the arena without being suspected.
Her parents had made all of her arrangements for her since she was young and had no freedom.
Now that the college entrance examination was over, she finally obtained a short period of freedom. It was not hard to understand why she had come here to find some excitement. There were many people who had the same situation as Mu Qingyi, so it would not attract Xue Jin’s attention.
Xue Jin roared, “Capture him quickly!”
At this moment, there was a commotion outside the crowd. Gradually, the entire place became quiet. Everyone realized that a battle was happening outside.
The battle did not last long. A group of people walked in from outside.
After seeing the clothes of these people, the entire place became silent.
The people who came were actually from the army. Why would they alert the army?
The leader pointed at Xue Jin and grabbed him.
Although Xue Jin was still unclear of the situation, he immediately activated his four skills to accelerate and run outside.
Five minutes later, Xue Jin was pushed back into the arena. No one could leave because the entire rooftop was under the military’s control.
“Xue Jin, I’m Ye Qingfeng from the military. Cooperate with the law enforcement team to capture you.”
Xue Jin sneered. “I’m just here to watch a competition. If you want to capture me, so be it.”
Ye Qingfeng took out a name list and held it up for everyone to see.
When Xue Jin saw the name list, he knew that he was finished.
Ye Qingfeng shouted, “This is the name list of all the people who are here today. We know your real identities. Whoever can give evidence of the person-in-charge can leave.”
Everyone shouted, “It’s him, Xue Jin!”
“That’s right, it’s him.”
Ye Qingfeng said, “Did you hear that? Xue Jin, I now have a lot of evidence to prove that you are the person-in-charge here. Do you have anything else to say?”
Xue Jin lowered his head and said no more.
Ye Qingfeng continued, “Tell me, who is your boss?”
“Who is my boss? I’m the boss. You’ve already investigated clearly. Why are you still asking who the boss is?”
Ye Qingfeng wasn’t in a hurry. He found a chair and sat down. “Mr. Mo, let’s begin the performance.”
At this moment, Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi walked out from the crowd.
When Xue Jin saw Mo Xiu appear at this moment, he immediately understood and cursed.
“Mo Xiu, you bastard. I always thought that you were just a young man who was overly arrogant. I didn’t expect you to be so shrewd.”
Mo Xiu shook his head and said, “My performance wasn’t perfect. You were too confident. Tell me, who is the boss behind this? Who was the person who called you?”
Xue Jin replied, “He’s just a big client. Who can order me around?”
Mo Xiu smiled happily, very happily.
“Hahaha, is that so? I already know that your real source of profit isn’t the revenue from the bets, but from informing your boss behind the scenes of the outcome. Then, your boss will place a bet on the winning side, and you will reap the profits.”
Xue Jin stared straight at Mo Xiu as though he wanted to eat him.
Mo Xiu continued, “There are two benefits to this kind of profit source. Firstly, even if the law enforcement team comes to raid the arena, you won’t lose too much. Secondly, you can hide the boss behind the scenes.”
Xue Jin looked at Mo Xiu with lifeless eyes. He no longer had the mood to ask Mo Xiu how he knew, because he knew that he was finished.
In fact, Mo Xiu had discovered a clue after the first King’s War. When Xue Jin gave him his rewards, Xue Jin saw that his total income was three million yuan, yet Xue Jin had given him more than half of his income.
Later on, Mo Xiu always calculated the time and went to look for Xue Jin when Xue Jin and Zhang Siyuan were settling accounts. After a while, he finally confirmed that he had not seen things. The income they received from the arena was not high.
The arena could not afford to lose money, so there must be other ways to earn money. They could only participate in gambling.
After knowing the gambling method of the arena, Mo Xiu could finally confirm that if there was someone behind Xue Jin, then there was a high chance that he would personally come to the arena to watch the matches and bets. Even if that person did not come himself, he would send someone he absolutely trusted.
Thus, today, Mo Xiu had intentionally not followed the script during the battle, just to see how Xue Jin and the mysterious boss behind him would react.
Xue Jin had planned this battle for a very long time and attached great importance to it. Thus, he would definitely invest a large amount of money.
If there was a change in the outcome of the competition, then regardless of whether it was Xue Jin or the boss behind him who had placed the bets, they would definitely suffer a huge loss. At that time, they would definitely be furious.
When the competition ended, Xue Jin immediately received a call. Mo Xiu could already confirm that this boss behind the scenes definitely existed. Furthermore, judging from the speed of the call, this person should be present.
Mo Xiu continued, “I’ve got your phone now and reported the phone number to the law enforcement team. The law enforcement team has already found out that the owner of this phone number is here. Would you like to identify that person yourself, or would you like to trouble Captain Ye Qingfeng to find them?”
Xue Jin’s face was ashen as he said, “So what if you found who the person on the phone was? How can you be sure that the person who came is the mastermind?”
Mo Xiu pulled Mu Qingyi aside to make way.
Then, Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan brought someone over.
That person was Xue Jin’s accountant, Zhang Siyuan!Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Twenty minutes ago, Mo Xiu’s match had just begun.
After Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan entered the Sky Treasure Hotel, they quickly found the room number that Mo Xiu had informed them of.
The person living in this room was Xue Jin’s accountant, Zhang Siyuan.
Mo Xiu had only obtained the room number today. At that time, Mo Xiu had been walking around in the corridor. Xue Jin only felt that Mo Xiu’s emotions were not very stable after obtaining the script.
Liu Ziyang looked at Yue Yuan inquiringly. Was this the place? Yue Yuan nodded.
Liu Ziyang took out his dagger and nodded at Yue Yuan.
Then, Yue Yuan punched Liu Ziyang, and Liu Ziyang disappeared.
When he reappeared, he was already behind the door. He used the teleportation effect of his Afterimage skill to sneak in. This method was thought of by Yue Yuan.
When Liu Ziyang heard this method, he slapped his thigh and said that Yue Yuan was a talent.
Liu Ziyang, who entered the room, saw a person standing with his back facing the door. It looked like a bodyguard.
Liu Ziyang didn’t hesitate. He used the critical hit effect after the afterimage was activated and directly killed his opponent with a dagger. Then, he gently placed this person on the ground.
He silently chanted, “Amitabha, Amitabha.”
After opening the door, he sneaked in with Yue Yuan and found Zhang Siyuan looking at the computer seriously inside the room.
Liu Ziyang wanted to go up and grab Zhang Siyuan but was stopped by Yue Yuan.
Two seconds later, three beams of light appeared beneath Zhang Siyuan’s feet.
Zhang Siyuan’s reaction couldn’t be slow. He immediately pressed on the keyboard, wanting to destroy the data, but he was still a little slow and was frozen by Yue Yuan’s three-layered wood array.
Then, Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang quickly controlled Zhang Siyuan.
According to Mo Xiu’s request, they found the account that had betted the largest amount through the back-end software.
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were both people who had seen the world. However, when they saw the betting amount, they were still stunned.
It was one billion yuan, a whole one billion. Who could have such wealth?
The two of them worked hard for a while before they found the name and bank account number associated with this account in the back-end software.
The bank account belonged to Wang Qiang. However, the two of them did not care as they knew that the name was definitely fake. The most important thing was the bank account number.
Then, they tied Zhang Siyuan up and rushed to the rooftop.
…
On the rooftop.
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan had just brought Zhang Siyuan out. Before Xue Jin could speak, a loud noise came from the stands.
“Boom!!!”
A huge fireball appeared out of nowhere in the stands, creating a disturbance.
Mo Xiu had not expected such a situation. The person behind the scenes might take the opportunity to escape.
On the other hand, Ye Qingfeng laughed.
“Hahahaha, if I wasn’t here today, you might have gotten your way, but you can’t run today.”
As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Qingfeng ran towards the spectator stands at an extremely fast speed. A second later, a person was thrown out of the stands and into the arena.
One of Ye Qingfeng’s skills was Lock, which allowed him to lock onto his target.
This person stood up and wanted to continue running, but he was controlled by Ye Qingfeng’s subordinates.
This person was wearing a mask as he glared at Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu chuckled and removed the person’s mask.
The moment his face was revealed, everyone was shocked. Many people knew this person, and it could even be said that he had a great reputation in Shun City.
He was the youngest son of the Shun City Lord, Qiu Qiu. It was hard to imagine that the person behind the scenes had such a powerful background.
Qiu Qiu was the top scholar of last year’s college entrance examination. Due to his outstanding results and the fact that he was the City Lord’s youngest son, the news was all over the place at that time. It could be said that he was a household name.
At that moment, Ye Qingfeng walked back and was shocked when he saw that it was Qiu Qiu.
“Qiu Qiu? It’s you? Why are you doing this?”
Qiu Qiu and Ye Qingfeng obviously knew each other. Qiu Qiu lowered his head and did not speak.
Ye Qingfeng continued, “I was originally cooperating with the law enforcement team and the Shadows to carry out a mission to capture someone. I didn’t expect to catch you. No matter what, I still have to hand you over to the law enforcement team to handle. As for the specific judgment, ask the City Lord.”
Ye Qingfeng lamented Qiu Qiu’s actions. He did not expect the son of the City Lord to do such a thing.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu had originally thought that the matter would be more complicated. Even with evidence, if Qiu Qiu had been hiding in the crowd, they would have needed a long time to investigate the situation.
He didn’t expect Qiu Qiu to jump out himself. This saved him a lot of trouble.
After Mo Xiu handed all the evidence and Zhang Siyuan to the enforcement team, the matter was considered to have come to an end.
At this moment, Qiu Qiu was handed over to the law enforcement team. When he walked past Mo Xiu, he spoke for the first time.
Qiu Qiu had already calmed down. He stared at Mo Xiu and smiled.
“Mo Xiu, I’ve lost to you once.”
Qiu Qiu’s words made Mo Xiu very uncomfortable. What did he mean by that? Could it be that he would still have the chance to take revenge after committing such a huge crime?
That was impossible! Under the current law, it was impossible even for the son of the City Lord to escape the law.
Afterwards, Xue Jin was also escorted over. Seeing that Mo Xiu did not speak, he only sighed softly.
The army cooperated with the law enforcement team and investigated everyone. All the relevant staff members in the arena were arrested.
At this moment, Mo Xiu saw two familiar faces — Boss Fang and his subordinates.
Boss Fang’s subordinate shouted at him, “F*ck you! Didn’t you say that there was nothing wrong with Mo Xiu? You even said that I’m not good at reading people, while you’re good at it! Look how good you are. You even managed to get a top spy in.”
Boss Fang said unhappily, “Mind your status. I’m your boss after all.”
The subordinate spat a mouthful of phlegm on Boss Fang’s face and said, “We’re f*cking going to jail. The company is gone. Why are you still acting like a boss?!”
After that, the two of them broke free from the control of the law enforcement team and started fighting. Mo Xiu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.
The rest of the audience had been released. Of course, they wouldn’t let them go just like that. Everyone’s real name was recorded by the law enforcement team now. Furthermore, those who could come here were all children from rich or powerful families. They could just look for them later.
The law enforcement team and Mo Xiu had a handover. As they had just solved a major case and had to investigate the spies, they could only go back and deal with it.
The crowd dispersed, but Ye Qingfeng stayed behind.
Ye Qingfeng sized up Mo Xiu with interest, making Mo Xiu feel uncomfortable.
Mo Xiu said, “Captain Ye, what’s the matter? Don’t look at me like that.”
Ye Qingfeng smiled embarrassedly and said, “It’s nothing. I was just thinking if it’s possible to poach you into our army.”
Mo Xiu smiled awkwardly.
Ye Qingfeng sighed and said, “Sigh! It’s a pity that you’re not under me. You performed very well this time. No! You can be said to be too outstanding. If I were you, I might not even be as good as you.”
Mo Xiu said respectfully, “Captain Ye is too humble. With your ability, you will definitely do better than me.”
“I’m talking about acting. Your acting skills are better than mine.”
Ye Qingfeng looked at Mo Xiu and the others. Then, he continued, “All of you, please take my contact details. If you need anything, you can look for me directly. You don’t have to look for me through the law enforcement team anymore. If you need any help, I will definitely help.”
Mo Xiu cupped his fists and said, “Thank you, Captain Ye.”
Then, Ye Qingfeng waved his hand and left.
Liu Ziyang was the first to step forward and say, “Boss, you’re too awesome. How did you come up with this plan?”
Yue Yuan and Mu Qingyi also looked at Mo Xiu questioningly.
“It’s nothing much. The plan was simple. We just needed to analyze the truth. Besides, that’s not what you should be praising.”
The three of them asked in unison, “Then what should we be praising you for?”
“Just as Captain Ye said, my acting skills are better. You can call me Movie King Mo in the future!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Dividing the Spoils
“You can call me Movie King Mo from now on.”
The serious topic was instantly diverted by Mo Xiu.
The three of them stared coldly at Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu smiled and said, “Alright! The mission’s over. Let’s divide the spoils!”
At the mention of dividing the spoils, the few of them became excited. Although other than Mo Xiu, the other three didn’t lack money. However, this was their first mission, and also their first time earning money. Thus, they were somewhat excited.
Mo Xiu took out his phone and opened the Shadow software to find the mission.
He realized that the mission had become a Grade-B mission. There was another explanation below.
“There was a system error in the assessment of the mission difficulty. The current level of the mission has increased from Grade-C to Grade-B. The point rewards have increased from 2,000 points to 8,000 points, and the cash reward has increased from 800,000 yuan to four million yuan.”
Liu Ziyang shouted, “F*ck, that’s a huge increase. That’s amazing.”
Yue Yuan rubbed his chin and said, “This reward is quite fair.”
When accepting the mission, Mo Xiu was the team leader, so all the rewards were sent to Mo Xiu’s account.
Mo Xiu split the rewards evenly into four portions. Thus, each person received 2,000 points and one million yuan.
At this moment, Mu Qingyi said, “Mo Xiu, this mission was almost completed by you alone. It’s not good for us to take so much, right?”
Yue Yuan added, “That’s right. We’ve helped too little. You’ve always been the one in danger and fighting with the enemy. We can’t take so much.”
In the end, Liu Ziyang also chimed in. “That’s right, Boss. I don’t need any rewards this time. I’ll just treat it as learning from you.”
Mo Xiu glared at Liu Ziyang and said, “Then what did you learn? If you didn’t learn anything, just keep the rewards. Alright, I’m the team leader. This matter is up to me. If you guys aren’t satisfied, you can be the team leader next time.”
After Mo Xiu finished speaking, Mu Qingyi and the others did not decline and could only accept the rewards.
Mo Xiu continued, “I originally wanted to take on a few more missions, but I didn’t expect this mission to take ten days. There are only five days left before I leave school. It seems like I can’t take on any other missions.”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan both looked regretful. This was because both of them felt that working with Mo Xiu was very comfortable and they could indeed learn some things.
Mu Qingyi said a little sadly, “Oh, let’s leave it at that. My journey is quite far, so I might have to leave for school in a few days.”
Mo Xiu sighed. “Sigh, are you leaving already?”
“Yes, I’m leaving.”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan looked at each other and realized that the atmosphere wasn’t right. They wanted to slip away.
Right at this time, Mu Qingyi seemed to have intentionally changed the topic, her eyes widening as she said, “Aiya, I almost forgot something.”
Mo Xiu and the other two looked towards Mu Qingyi.
Mu Qingyi took out a bank card and handed it to Mo Xiu.
“All the money won from gambling is here.”
Mo Xiu had indeed given Mu Qingyi another mission previously, which was to bet all the money he earned from boxing on his victory. Then, she would take those winnings and bet on his victory again. Although she did not know how much money there was in the card, it was definitely not a small amount.
Mo Xiu smiled and took it. Then, he said to the three of them, “We’ll take this money…”
The three of them moved in unison and shook their heads vigorously.
Mo Xiu actually wanted to say, “Let’s split the money.” However, looking at the three of them, it was unlikely that they would accept it.
The three of them knew that they had already taken advantage of Mo Xiu for the mission reward. Furthermore, this money had nothing to do with them.
The few of them chatted for a while before heading downstairs.
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were very sensible. As soon as they went downstairs, they found an excuse to leave.
Mo Xiu asked, “Where’s your house? I’ll send you back.”
Mu Qingyi nodded and said, “Sure, my house is in the villa district in the east of the city.”
The villa area in the east of the city was very far from here. Mo Xiu asked, “Do you want to take a taxi back? Or do you want someone to pick you up?”
Mu Qingyi revealed a brilliant smile and said, “Let’s take a walk.”
After saying those words, Mo Xiu continued walking forward. After standing there in a daze for a second, he shook his head, smiled, and gave chase.
“Mo Xiu, I didn’t have a childhood. Can you tell me about your childhood?”
Mo Xiu thought about it and said, “Based on what I can remember, I would run in the park in the morning, read books in the library in the afternoon, and practice boxing at night. When I started going to school, I would attend classes in the morning and practice boxing at night.”
Mu Qingyi looked at Mo Xiu as if she was looking at a monster and asked, “Why was your life so hard?”
“From a young age, my mother took great pains to take care of me. At that time, my mother had no job. I could tell that she was very tired, but she always smiled at me. At that time, I swore that I would become a man to take care of my mother.”
Mu Qingyi’s gaze towards Mo Xiu changed and became gentle. She did not know what to say for a moment.
Mo Xiu didn’t say anything either. The two of them walked quietly like this, as if they had returned to the stone at the Cosmic Tuition Class.
“Let me tell you about my childhood!”
A sudden sentence broke the silence. The two of them looked at each other and laughed.
“Hahaha, didn’t you say that you didn’t have a childhood?”
Mu Qingyi covered her mouth and laughed lightly. “I feel that I had more of a childhood compared to you.”
“Alright then, tell me about it!”
“I… I’ve seen other people jumping rope when I was young. Have you played it before?”
Mo Xiu shook his head and said, “What is that?”
Mu Qingyi’s eyes shifted mischievously as she said, “It involves a witch using an incantation to activate a rubber band.”
Mo Xiu asked in confusion, “A witch? An incantation? What’s that?”
“Oh my, you’re so stupid. When a witch uses an incantation, the rubber band will move on its own.”
“An incantation? Are you talking about a skill?”
“No, it’s not like that. I remember the incantation goes something like this. The Malan Flower blooms 21, 28256, 28257,
282931
…”
Mo Xiu’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Really?”
“Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha…”
Mu Qingyi laughed until she was swaying back and forth.
When Mo Xiu saw Mu Qingyi laughing like this, he immediately understood that Mu Qingyi was lying to him.
Mo Xiu looked at Mu Qingyi with a straight face and said, “To think that I, Movie King Mo, trusted you so much. You actually teased me.”
When Mu Qingyi heard Mo Xiu’s words, she laughed even more happily. She held her stomach as she squatted on the ground, almost bursting into tears.
Mo Xiu asked, “Is it that funny?”
Mu Qingyi said, “Yes, I’ve never been so happy before. Perhaps I’ve never been so relaxed before.”
Mo Xiu pretended to be innocent and said, “Alright, since you’re so happy teasing me, I’ll let you tease me every day from now on.”
Mu Qingyi stood up and walked a few steps forward. She turned around and said, “Who wants to tease you? How shameless!”
Mo Xiu chased after her and shrugged. “What if I tease you?”
Mu Qingyi stuck out her tongue and said, “That won’t do either!”
The two of them continued to walk forward. Mu Qingyi suddenly said, “Mo Xiu, if only we could continue walking and not go home.”
“Yes. I’ll walk with you.”
…
The two of them walked from dawn to sunrise, from sunrise to late in the morning, and finally reached Mu Qingyi’s house.
The two didn’t say goodbye when they parted, because they both knew that they would definitely meet again.
That night, Mo Xiu took the longest walk of his life. That night, Mo Xiu said the most words in his life.Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Buying a House
Mo Xiu didn’t go home immediately. He sent a message to his mother and told her that he would return tonight.
After that, Mo Xiu checked the balance in his bank card. The total amount in his card was 15,322,443 yuan.
Mo Xiu leaned closer to the screen and carefully counted the amount.
“Damn, there’s over 15 million yuan!”
With so much money, Mo Xiu could no longer remain calm. After some thought, he gave Zheng Yi a call.
“Hello, Mo Xiu. Why haven’t you been picking up my calls these few days?”
“I was busy with something these few days. It wasn’t convenient for me to call.”
“What’s the matter? I knew you had taken Mu Qingyi down. You two went to have some alone time, right? How awesome.”
“Stop talking nonsense. Are you free now? Come out for a while.”
“I’m free. What do you want to do?”
“Come and fetch me. I have something to ask you. I’m at…”
Mo Xiu hung up the call. He had nothing to do while waiting for Zheng Yi, so he looked through his phone.
When he opened the Shadow Software, a notification popped up.
“You have received 2,000 points. The Points Mall has opened.”
Mo Xiu realized that there was really a Points Mall option beside his profile.
Mo Xiu felt that the Points Mall must be very high-end. There would definitely be some herbs inside.
When he opened it, he was dumbfounded. What was this?
“One hundred pounds of rice for one point.”
“One pair of designer shoes for two points.”
“One car for 100 points.”
“One pig for 10 points.”
What the hell was this? It was practically a grocery store. There was even a pig that actually cost 10 points. Oh, sorry, pork was indeed expensive now.
Just as Mo Xiu was about to curse, he realized that the Points Mall was the same as his shopping application. It recommended popular products to him.
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but wonder what kind of people among the Shadows paid attention to such things.
He found the classification search bar and took a look at what was available. This Points Mall was really all-encompassing. It had everything from divine-grade herbs weapons to socks and shoes.
Mo Xiu took a quick look and found a herb that he was more familiar with, the Spirit Ring. The price of one Spirit Ring was 50,000 points.
It seemed that herbs were expensive no matter where they were sold. He had only received 8,000 points from a Grade-B mission, while a Spirit Ring cost 50,000 points.
As he flipped through the products, a car horn sounded. Mo Xiu looked up and saw that it was Zheng Yi.
After Mo Xiu got into the car, Zheng Yi asked, “Where have you been these past few days? You practically vanished into thin air. Why did you call me out the moment you appeared?”
“I want to buy a house for my mother.”
“Where?”
“I want to buy a house that’s near your place. I hope that someone can take care of my mother.”
Zheng Yi thought for a while before gritting his teeth and saying, “Alright, the houses near my house are a little expensive. I might not be able to afford them, but the prices of the houses in the neighborhood are still acceptable. I’ll borrow money from my dad to buy them for you.”
“There’s no need for that. I’ll just buy a house in your neighborhood, preferably a house next to yours.”
Zheng Yi glared at him and said, “Mo Xiu, you’re pushing your luck. Where can I get you that much money?”
Mo Xiu said angrily, “Who told you to use your money to buy me a house? I’ll buy the house myself. I’ll visit your house later and ask your parents to take care of my mom.”
Zheng Yi was stunned. Mo Xiu asked, “What’s wrong? Is there a problem?”
Zheng Yi said, “Mo Xiu, the house next to mine might cost five million yuan.”
“Yeah, that’s no problem.”
“That’s right. I know you can’t afford it, but… Ah?!! Are you telling me that there’s no problem?!!”
Mo Xiu couldn’t stand Zheng Yi’s nagging anymore, so he pulled Zheng Yi out of the car and looked at his balance again.
When he returned to the car, Zheng Yi asked worriedly, “Mo Xiu, you… You haven’t been provided for by a rich lady over the past few days, right? Which rich lady is so rich?”
Mo Xiu simply couldn’t take it anymore. He slammed the car door shut and said, “Cut the crap. Let’s go. We’ll move tomorrow after we’re done here today.”
Zheng Yi wanted to ask more, but seeing that Mo Xiu was unhappy, he could only give up. Then, he drove back to his house.
Mo Xiu first bought some gifts and went home with Zheng Yi. Although Zheng Yi’s family background wasn’t as extravagant as Mu Qingyi, Liu Ziyang, and Yue Yuan’s, they were still considered extremely wealthy.
Mr. Zheng worked in a security company. He had high prestige and status there.
Bodyguards were considered top jobs in today’s society because many people who were good at business did not have the strength to protect themselves. They could only hire bodyguards to guard themselves.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Zheng was a businesswoman and had a small company. Thus, the Zheng family was quite famous in the area.
Zheng Yi’s parents weren’t old-fashioned people. Mo Xiu had come to the Zheng family’s house once before and both of them had a good impression of him.
Now that they knew that Mo Xiu was the top scholar in the college entrance examination, they praised Mo Xiu in front of Zheng Yi.
After Mo Xiu made some polite remarks, he explained his intentions. Mr. Zheng agreed without any hesitation.
After that, he even helped Mo Xiu communicate with his neighbor, who quickly agreed to sell the house to Mo Xiu.
After an entire afternoon of handling the procedures, this house belonged to Mo Xiu. It cost 5.5 million.
The neighbor had also agreed to move out the next day. The people who could live here definitely had more than just this property. On account of Mr. Zheng, as well as the fact that Mo Xiu was the top scholar of the college entrance examination, the other party was very willing to give Mo Xiu this favor.
Before Mo Xiu left, he felt a little embarrassed. Mr. Zheng was so busy with work, yet he even took the entire afternoon to help Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu felt a little apologetic. He had to thank the Zheng family in the future.
Mo Xiu had been busy the entire day and only returned home around 9 pm.
The moment he entered the house, she saw a figure and a table full of food.
His mother was still the same. Mo Xiu sat at the table and looked at the scattered white hair on her mother’s head, feeling a little upset.
His hard work over the years had paid off. He could let his mother lead a better life.
However, her mother had been too tired and lonely all these years. She had been guarding such a home alone.
“Xiao Xiu, you haven’t been home for the next few days. Many admission notices have been sent home. You can go and take a look at which school you want to go to before replying to them.”
Her mother pointed to a bag on the sofa.
After the college entrance examination ended, the various universities would send admission notices to the students who wanted to be admitted. The students would choose which school they wanted to go to. Then, they would need to send a message to the designated number on the notice.
“Mom, let’s not talk about this for now. I bought you a house near Zheng Yi’s house so that we can take care of one another. We’ll move there tomorrow. By the way, you should quit your job too.”
Li Yuan looked at her son seriously and said, “Xiao Xiu, where did you get the money?”
“Mom, I earned the money from doing missions. Don’t worry, I’m doing the right thing.”
“Missions? As long as you can walk the right path, I’m alright with anything.”
“Mom, can we move there tomorrow?”
“Alright! Alright!”
…
After dinner, Mo Xiu returned to his room with a bag of admission notices.
He spread them out on the bed and realized that there were probably more than a hundred cards.
Although the news of Mo Xiu being the top scorer had been blocked, the universities weren’t stupid. They all extended their olive branches to him.
He opened one of them and took a look. The reward was 200,000 yuan.
Mo Xiu hadn’t expected that his status as the top scholar of the college entrance examination would allow him to start earning money.
However, Mo Xiu wasn’t interested in these things. He just wanted to see what conditions Yanjing University had offered.
Mo Xiu only wanted to go to the best school. No matter what the other schools offered, he wouldn’t go.
After flipping through for a long time, he finally found the notice from Yanjing University.
There was only one reward for accepting the offer. His tuition fees would be free as he would receive a full scholarship.
Mo Xiu smiled. Yanjing University was indeed confident and did not give him any special privileges.
He sent a message to the number on the notice.
“Shun City First High School, Mo Xiu, 1,000 marks for the college entrance examination.”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Moving
The next morning, his mother went to the office to resign. Mo Xiu also woke up early to pack up and move.
However, when Mo Xiu looked around, there didn’t seem to be anything he wanted to take. It was just some old furniture. The new house was full of furniture left behind by the upper-class family.
It was not a problem to move there first. If there was anything he needed to change, he could buy it later on. There was really no need to move the things at home.
After tidying up, there were only some clothes and a backpack that his mother had packed yesterday. Thus, there were a total of two bags.
When his mother returned, they each took a backpack and left.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi was ordered by Mr. Zheng to pick up Mo Xiu and Li Yuan. The three of them chatted for a while before arriving at their new home.
The new house was a small villa with a huge living room. There was a bathroom, a kitchen, and two guest rooms on the first floor. Meanwhile, there were three bedrooms and a study on the second floor. The decor was simple and was Mo Xiu’s favorite style.
Li Yuan entered the spacious new house with a calm expression as usual. She was not as excited as Mo Xiu had imagined.
Speaking of which, Mo Xiu had never seen his mother emotional before. She had always been so elegant and peaceful.
Li Yuan looked around briefly and said to Mo Xiu, “Son, thank you!”
Seeing that his mother was satisfied, Mo Xiu was relieved. He sat down on the sofa and said, “Mom, I’m your son. There’s no need to thank me.”
When Li Yuan saw Zheng Yi, who was standing at the side, she suddenly woke up and said, “Xiao Xiu, why didn’t you remind me? The two of us should have visited the Zheng family first. Let’s go!”
Zheng Yi said from the side, “Auntie, my dad said that there’s no need to rush over. My parents are at work today, so he asked me to accompany you. After you guys have settled down, please come over for dinner tonight.”
Upon hearing this, Li Yuan nodded and started packing.
Mo Xiu wanted to help, but his mother arranged for him to accompany Zheng Yi.
Zheng Yi was also helpless. He was here to help, but now, Li Yuan had arranged for Mo Xiu to accompany him.
There wasn’t much luggage anyway, so Mo Xiu left his mother to sort it out. Then, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi sat in the living room and chatted.
However, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi didn’t have much free time as Li Yuan wasn’t satisfied with the arrangement of some furniture.
The two of them went from being treated as VIPs to being laborers. The entire morning passed.
The villa Li Yuan had tidied up looked even grander. The furniture was placed naturally.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi looked at Li Yuan in confusion. She was so talented that she could design a house for others.
After Li Yuan was done with her work, she said to Mo Xiu, “Xiao Xiu, Xiao Yi, that’s about it. I took a look, and saw that the furniture and decorations don’t need to be touched. We can just use them. We’re not unreasonable people after all. However, we still need to buy new bedding and bedroom necessities. Why don’t we go out and buy some?”
Zheng Yi was used to being unrestrained. He had been holding it in for the entire morning, so he immediately got up.
“Auntie, no problem. We’ll leave now!”
The three of them left in high spirits. Since it was already noon, they had a simple meal and headed straight to the shopping center.
Li Yuan said hesitantly, “Little Yi, we’re just buying some simple things. There’s no need to come here. The things sold here are a little expensive.”
Zheng Yi said casually, “Auntie, Mo Xiu has plenty of money now. Don’t worry.”
Mo Xiu also gave his mother a reassuring look.
As soon as Li Yuan entered the mall, she started picking out the things that she needed at home. Soon, she returned with a full load.
After that, Li Yuan proposed to buy some ingredients and gifts. After all, they were going to the Zheng family’s house for dinner. It was their first visit, so they should get something.
As soon as they started buying, another pile was formed. Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi, the two laborers, were all over the place.
When they were about to leave, they passed by a dress shop. Mo Xiu said, “Mom, you should buy one. After all, we have to go for dinner today.”
Li Yuan was a little hesitant. She had already spent a lot of Mo Xiu’s money. She didn’t want Mo Xiu to spend so much money on a dress. However, when she thought about going to the Zheng family’s house for a meal, she felt that it would be rude to dress too casually.
In the end, she was dragged in by Mo Xiu. Li Yuan did not like to show off and chose a simple black dress.
The shopping trip finally came to an end. The spoils of war filled Zheng Yi’s car to the brim.
When Li Yuan saw this situation, she felt a little embarrassed.
When they got home, the three of them packed up again. Once they were done, it was already 5 pm.
Zheng Yi said, “Auntie, my mom should be back by now. Should we go over?”
Li Yuan quickly put down her work and said, “Okay, we’ll go over now. Xiao Xiu, take the gifts and ingredients. We’ll go over to their house.”
The three of them arrived at the Zheng family’s house. Mrs. Zheng was also a very easygoing person. The moment she met Li Yuan, she started chatting. After chatting for a while, the two of them went to the kitchen to cook.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi sat on the sofa in boredom.
Zheng Yi asked, “Mo Xiu, are you going to Yanjing University?”
“Yeah, I just texted them yesterday. How about you?”
“Of course I won’t let you off. I’m also going to Yanjing, but I’m not going to Yanjing University. Yanjing University’s admission score this year is too scary. My results were actually not accepted.”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “It’s fine. At least we’re still in the same city.”
Zheng Yi nodded.
Just then, Mr. Zheng returned home. Li Yuan quickly came out of the kitchen to greet him.
Mr. Zheng jokingly said, “Yo, it’s such a rare day today. Two hostesses are actually cooking personally. We’re in for a treat.”
Then, Mr. Zheng took off his coat and sat on the sofa.
“Mo Xiu, let’s upgrade today’s party. Get all your friends here. We’ll have a good time.”
Mr. Zheng had heard from Zheng Yi that Mo Xiu had been working hard since he was young. He spent most of his time training and had very few friends. Hence, he got Mo Xiu to bring his friends over.
Mo Xiu felt a little embarrassed. After all, this wasn’t his home.
“Uncle, I don’t think that’s a good idea. I can invite them another day. Let’s just have a meal together today.”
Mr. Zheng pretended to be angry and said, “Why? Are you treating Uncle as an outsider? Hurry up and look for your friends now. We will be eating soon.”
Mo Xiu tried to decline again, but Mr. Zheng insisted. Thus, Mo Xiu could only compromise.
Mo Xiu picked up the phone and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. How could he have any friends? It seemed like he had failed in his life all these years.
In the end, after thinking about it, Mu Qingyi should have already left by now. Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were the only two other people he had a good relationship with, so he should find these two.
When Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan picked up Mo Xiu’s call, they both accepted his offer immediately.
Mo Xiu returned to the sofa and said, “Uncle, Zheng Yi also knows that I don’t have many friends. I only called two friends over today.”
Mr. Zheng smiled and said, “Alright, there are many young people today. I’ll be younger too.”
Not long after, Liu Ziyang came. The moment he entered, he cupped his fists and said to Mr. Zheng, “I’m Liu Ziyang, sorry for disturbing you today.”
Mr. Zheng didn’t get angry because of Liu Ziyang’s actions. Instead, he kept praising Liu Ziyang for being interesting.
Liu Ziyang was also studying at Yanjing University. Thus, the conversation topic among the three young people was naturally related to Yanjing.
At first, Mr. Zheng didn’t think much of it, but the more he listened, the more shocked he became.
In the end, he finally figured out Liu Ziyang’s identity. He was the son of the Liu Corporation in Beijing, which was a company that had a certain amount of authority in Beijing. He was actually Mo Xiu’s friend.
Mr. Zheng was shocked that Mo Xiu could make such a friend. He even saw that Liu Ziyang kept calling Mo Xiu “Boss”. Mr. Zheng truly couldn’t understand Mo Xiu.
However, Mr. Zheng gradually calmed down. He felt gratified that his son could make such a friend.Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Mo Xiu’s Identity
The three young men were chatting enthusiastically when the door rang.
Mo Xiu heard someone knocking on the door. It should be Yue Yuan. He was about to open the door.
However, the moment he moved, Mr, Zheng stopped him.
“You guys chat, I’ll open the door!”
Mr. Zheng stood up and opened the door. Then, he was shocked to see the person at the door.
“Uncle Zheng?”
“Young boss? Why are you here?”
Yue Yuan took a few steps back and looked at the door sign. “That’s right. Mo Xiu said he had moved and wanted me to join in the fun. Did I walk in the wrong direction?”
Mr. Zheng turned around and looked at Mo Xiu. Why did this young lad who grew up in the slums have so much power?
If the Liu Corporation was beyond the reach of the government, then the power behind this person could absolutely be said to be the local tyrant of Shun City.
The security company that Mr. Zheng worked for was under Yue Yuan’s father, Yue Long.
One of the two people whom Mr. Zheng admired the most in his life was the City Lord, Qiu Qiming, who had saved an entire city. The other person was Yue Long, who had come to Shun City alone and started from scratch to become one of the top people in Shun City within ten years.
“Uncle Zheng! Uncle Zheng! Is Mo Xiu here? If not, I’ll take my leave first. I’ll visit again in the future.”
Only then did Mr. Zheng react. Then, he hurriedly said, “Yes, Mo Xiu is here. Come in.”
Everyone was here, and the dishes were ready. Mr. Zheng, Liu Ziyang, and Yue Yuan were chatting. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi helped to serve the dishes.
The few of them sat down. Then, Li Yuan changed and came out. Everyone was stunned.
Li Yuan’s temperament was too compatible with this set of clothes. Normally, one would not be used to wearing such clothes.
However, Li Yuan did not seem that way at all. She placed her hand on her abdomen and walked over slowly. It was as if Li Yuan should have been wearing such clothes all along.
Mo Xiu also suddenly felt that his mother shouldn’t have suffered so much all these years. His mother should have led such a life.
Seeing that everyone was staring at her, Li Yuan felt a little embarrassed. Thinking that everyone was waiting for her, she jogged to the dining table.
Mrs. Zheng said, “Everyone, please try our cooking.”
Mr. Zheng first picked up a piece of chicken and put it into his mouth. After savoring it carefully, he said, “Honey, it’s great! Your culinary skills haven’t decreased at all. It still tastes the same!”
Mrs. Zheng snapped, “Mo Xiu’s mother made this!”
Mr. Zheng smiled awkwardly and picked up another vegetable dish to savor.
“Mmm, honey, this dish is really good!”
Mrs. Zheng rolled her eyes at him and said, “She made this too.”
Mr. Zheng couldn’t hide his embarrassment anymore. Why was his wife’s signature dish made by someone else?
In the end, he could only say, “Ms. Li, your cooking skills are really good.”
Zheng Yi was secretly laughing when Mr. Zheng glared at him.
Mo Xiu sighed. It seemed that Zheng Yi’s joker tendencies ran in the family.
Everyone was talking and laughing during the meal. Mr. Zheng, Mrs. Zheng, and Li Yuan were not old-fashioned people. They chatted with the children.
Finally, they talked about Li Yuan. Mrs. Zheng said, “Ms. Li, what do you plan to do in the future? We can get along well. Why don’t you come to my company and be my secretary?”
Mr. Zheng interrupted, “Hey! How can you let her work for you?”
Mrs. Zheng didn’t know Mo Xiu’s current identity, but Mr. Zheng knew.
During this meal, Mr. Zheng understood that Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were sincere towards Mo Xiu. Not only that, they were also respectful towards him.
For example, Liu Ziyang always called Mo Xiu “Boss.” It seemed as if the two of them really treated Mo Xiu as their boss.
With the status and spirit of these two young masters, Mr. Zheng would never believe that they were willing to treat Mo Xiu as their boss without being told by their elders to do so.
Hence, Father Zheng concluded that Mo Xiu had an unknown identity that even the local tyrant of Shun City, Yue Long, feared.
Now, it was not about taking care of Li Yuan. He had to be more respectful to Li Yuan and not anger her.
After hearing Mr. Zheng’s words, Mrs. Zheng did not say anything else.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi said, “Dad, Mom, I saw today that Auntie has a very good house setup.”
Mr. Zheng and Mrs. Zheng both looked at Li Yuan. Li Yuan said, “I don’t dare to say I’m good at it, but I do like it.”
Mrs. Zheng said, “I have a friend who owns a renovation company. Are you interested in becoming an interior decoration consultant?”
Without waiting for Li Yuan’s reply, Yue Yuan said, “Auntie, my father has a company like this under his name. It’s not small. If you’re willing, I can transfer the ownership of this company to you.”
Everyone looked at Yue Yuan in shock. This was what it meant to be rich. One word and he would give them a company!
Mo Xiu also looked at Yue Yuan strangely. What happened today?
In reality, after the last mission, Yue Yuan had told Yue Long about Mo Xiu when he returned home.
When Yue Long heard that Mo Xiu was related to Elder Tang, and that Mo Xiu was a poor fellow, he had a good impression of Mo Xiu.
Li Yuan looked at Yue Yuan, then looked at Mo Xiu. Then, she said, “Thank you, but I’m not capable enough. I’ll train first. I think Mrs. Zheng’s job offer is quite suitable for me.”
Yue Yuan wanted to persuade her but Mo Xiu shook his head and said, “Okay, Auntie. Mo Xiu will be going to Yanjing in a few days. If you need anything, you can look for me directly.”
Liu Ziyang could not take it anymore. He patted Yue Yuan’s chest and said, “Hey, hey, hey, hey, that’s enough. It’s a little too much. You’re so attentive!”
Zheng Yi interrupted, “Haha, I also think that Old Yue is a little too much.”
Zheng Yi was naturally approachable. In just one meal, he got along well with Liu Ziyang.
Mr. Zheng saw that his son was behaving inappropriately and scolded him. “Zheng Yi!”
Zheng Yi rolled his eyes and lowered his head to eat without saying another word.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu said to Mrs. Zheng, “Then I’ll have to trouble Auntie to introduce my mother to the job.”
Mrs. Zheng was the boss of a small company after all. Thus, she could tell that something was wrong with the atmosphere at the dining table.
“Hey, okay. Don’t be so polite with me. It’s not a big deal.”
After the meal, Mo Xiu and Li Yuan left first.
Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan chatted enthusiastically with Zheng Yi for a while before leaving.
When Yue Yuan walked to the door, he said to Father Zheng, “Uncle Zheng, if Auntie Li Yuan needs anything, please let me know immediately.”
Mr. Zheng said, “Alright, I understand!”
After the two of them left, Mr. Zheng asked Zheng Yi, “Do you know what other identities Mo Xiu has?”
Zheng Yi was a little confused as he shook his head. “No, isn’t Mo Xiu normal?”
Mrs. Zheng asked, “What exactly happened? I didn’t dare to speak just now.”
Mr. Zheng said, “Liu Ziyang is the son of the Liu Corporation. That’s right! I’m talking about the Liu Corporation in Yanjing. Meanwhile, Yue Yuan is the son of my boss. Do you understand what I mean?”
Mrs. Zheng was so shocked that she could not speak. The status of these two people far exceeded her own.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi could not believe that the two people he was talking to just now had such a background.
“Dad, are you sure? How could Mo Xiu know them?”
Seeing his father glare at him, Zheng Yi could only lower his head and say, “Damn, this is awesome. It’ll be easier for him to survive in Yanjing.”
Mr. Zheng looked at his unstable son and asked seriously, “Zheng Yi, tell me honestly, how close are you to Mo Xiu?”
Zheng Yi thought about it and said, “It’s hard to say how close we are. Let’s put it this way.”
“We share a life-and-death relationship!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Soaring Dragon Hotel
For the next two days, Mo Xiu was very relaxed. He accompanied his mother everywhere and felt very comfortable.
Mo Xiu might not be back for a long time after going to Yanjing, so he wanted to spend more time with his mother.
Today was the 14th day of his holiday. Mo Xiu would be leaving for Yanjing tomorrow, so he was watching his mother pack his luggage.
At this moment, there was a knock on the door.
When Mo Xiu opened the door, he saw that it was Zheng Yi. Before Zheng Yi could speak, Mo Xiu had already closed the door.
Zheng Yi shouted from outside, “Hey! Mo Xiu! I have something to talk to you about!”
Mo Xiu replied, “Didn’t I tell you not to look for me these few days?”
Zheng Yi knocked a few more times and said, “Quick, open the door. I have an appointment with Ye Qian’er and Liu Qingyu today.”
Only then did Mo Xiu remember that he had always wanted to treat the two of them to a meal, but he had never had the time to do so.
After Mo Xiu opened the door, Zheng Yi came in and ran to the sofa to complain to Li Yuan.
“Auntie, tell me about Mo Xiu. He only has a few friends. Is he trying to lose another one by locking me outside?”
Li Yuan knew about the relationship between Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi. Thus,she definitely knew that he was joking.
She pretended to be angry and said to Mo Xiu, “Xiao Xiu, how could you do this to Zheng Yi? Quickly go and meet your classmates.”
Zheng Yi looked at Mo Xiu smugly. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu looked at his mother. He probably wouldn’t be able to accompany his mother today.
Thus, Mo Xiu tidied up briefly before following Zheng Yi out.
After getting into the car, Mo Xiu asked, “Why did you invite them to a meal today?”
Zheng Yi said sarcastically, “Hey! How do we have to cheek to ask a busy bee like you out? How do you have the time?! You disappeared for ten days the moment you went on vacation and then came back to move. If I didn’t forcefully drag you out today, wouldn’t you still be busy?”
Mo Xiu knew that he was in the wrong and could only change the topic. “Where are we going to eat today?”
At the mention of this topic, Zheng Yi proudly took out a card and handed it to Mo Xiu.
“Isn’t this the diamond membership card of the Soaring Dragon Hotel?”
Mo Xiu was shocked. The Soaring Dragon Hotel was the most luxurious hotel in the city. If Mr. Zheng had this card, Mo Xiu would believe it. However, how could Zheng Yi have this card? It was impossible!
“Zheng Yi, did you steal your dad’s card?”
When Zheng Yi heard this, he acted arrogantly.
“This is my card. Yesterday, I sent a message to ask if Yue Yuan had any good restaurants to recommend. He simply gave me this.”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “I didn’t expect you to be in contact with Yue Yuan. Did your father instruct you to interact more with Yue Yuan?”
Having been seen through, Zheng Yi said unhappily, “It’s none of your business! However, my dad’s membership card is only a platinum card. When I brought this card back yesterday, my dad’s shameless expression made me laugh.”
Mo Xiu sighed. Zheng Yi was really shameless. He even teased his own father.
They sped all the way to the Soaring Dragon Hotel. Liu Qingyu was already waiting there.
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi alighted from the car and immediately went forward to welcome him.
Mo Xiu was the first to speak. “Brother Liu, you’re early. Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s hurry up and go in!”
Liu Qingyu was still as graceful and courteous as ever. Cupping his hands, he said, “Eh? What are you saying? I also just arrived.”
The three of them walked into the hotel lobby. As soon as they entered, they saw golden lights everywhere.
Unlike the main hall of other restaurants, this place only had a receptionist, a spacious hall, and rows of sofas.
The Soaring Dragon Hotel did not have a bar for guests. Instead, the lobby was specially used to receive guests. As they had a membership system, it only received members.
Zheng Yi went to talk to the front desk while Mo Xiu and Liu Qingyu sat on the sofa and chatted.
Mo Xiu said, “Brother Liu, thank you for helping me during my absence.”
Liu Qingyu waved his hand and said, “It’s nothing. The three of us are old acquaintances. If we can help, of course we have to help.”
Before Mo Xiu could reply, Zheng Yi had already returned.
Mo Xiu asked, “Are you done?”
“No problem. We got the best room. Shall we go up first?”
Mo Xiu looked at the entrance. Ye Qian’er had not arrived yet.
Zheng Yi immediately understood and said to Liu Qingyu, “Qingyu, let’s go up first and have Mo Xiu stay behind to wait for Ye Qian’er.”
“Alright, you guys go up first. I’ll stay and wait.”
At this moment, Ye Qian’er hurriedly ran into the main hall, holding her knees as she panted heavily. She lifted her head and saw Mo Xiu.
She jogged over to Mo Xiu, but when she stood in front of Mo Xiu, he didn’t know what to say.
She bowed and said, “Senior Mo, I’m sorry I’m late.”
Mo Xiu quickly stood up and helped Ye Qian’er up. “Hahaha, what are you doing? I’m treating you to a meal today. Why are you apologizing?”
Ye Qian’er stood up straight, not knowing what to say.
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “Let’s go. Follow me.”
Ye Qian’er followed behind Mo Xiu and pouted. She had embarrassed herself again!
…
On the eighth floor, in a lively and elegant room…
Just as Zheng Yi had said, this was the best room. Not only did it have a dining table, it also had a bedroom, a lounge, and even a swimming pool. It was a simple villa.
Before they entered the room, the dishes had already been served. The table was full of dishes, but Mo Xiu couldn’t even name any of them.
The few of them were currently chatting enthusiastically.
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi once again thanked Liu Qingyu and Ye Qian’er. To be able to help at the most difficult time, they truly valued the friendship among them.
Zheng Yi asked, “Qingyu, which school are you going to? Your grades should be enough for Yanjing University, right?”
Liu Qingyu smiled. “Yes, my score is high enough, but I don’t like Yanjing. I’m going to Wu Country instead.”
Mo Xiu was a little surprised that someone could get into Yanjing University, yet did not go there.
“Brother Liu, why is that so? Is there anything wrong with Yanjing?”
Liu Qingyu shook his head and said, “It’s not that Yanjing is bad. It’s just that I don’t want to go because of some personal reasons.”
Seeing that Liu Qingyu was unwilling to speak, Mo Xiu did not probe further.
Seeing that Ye Qian’er was still a little reserved, Mo Xiu asked, “Ye Qian’er, you’re already in your third year of high school when the school year starts again. Which university are you planning to enroll in next?”
Zheng Yi teased, “That’s right. Sister Qian’er, where are you going to apply? Are you going to Yanjing to look for Mo Xiu?”
Mo Xiu had wanted Ye Qian’er to relax, but after hearing Zheng Yi’s words, he felt even more uneasy.
Meanwhile, Ye Qian’er looked at Mo Xiu and quickly lowered her head again. Mo Xiu glared at Zheng Yi. He truly caused trouble all day.
At this moment, Ye Qian’er’s phone rang. She took it out and hung up after taking a look.
Mo Xiu asked, “What’s wrong? Who called you? It’s okay, just pick it up.”
Ye Qian’er shook her head and whispered, “It’s nothing. It’s just an unimportant phone call.”
Before Ye Qian’er could finish her sentence, another call came in.
Seeing that Ye Qian’er seemed a little unhappy, Mo Xiu said, “It’s okay, you can pick up the call!”
Ye Qian’er nodded and went to the side to answer the call.
…
The meal ended very quickly. The four of them walked out of the restaurant and prepared to part ways.
Ye Qian’er lowered her head with a flushed face, not daring to speak to Mo Xiu until they separated.
After everyone left, she clenched her fists and muttered to herself, “Ye Qian’er, you’re so useless. You didn’t even bid Senior Mo farewell properly.”
Since they were leaving Shun City tomorrow, everyone went home to make preparations.
Mo Xiu had just reached home when his phone rang. He took it out and saw that it was Yue Yuan.
“Hello, Mo Xiu. I just arrived at the Soaring Dragon Hotel. Why did you leave?”
“If there’s nothing, you can just leave. Thank you.”
“Hey, why are you thanking me? Alright then, go on with your work. Let’s keep in touch in the future.”
Mo Xiu didn’t expect Yue Yuan to personally make a trip there.Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Yanjing University
They got off the train and left the station.
Mo Xiu stood outside Yanjing Station and looked at the city.
He could only see the surrounding buildings. He could only see a corner of this city.
However, this was the first time Mo Xiu had come to another city, to a place he was completely unfamiliar with.
This was a new beginning. Who knew what would happen in the future?
Liu Ziyang patted Mo Xiu and pulled Mo Xiu back from his emotional state.
“Boss, we’ve reached Yanjing. Come to my house first.”
Mo Xiu thought for a while and said, “I think I’ll go to school first. I’ll definitely visit your house in Yanjing, but I haven’t settled down yet. It’s a little abrupt.”
Liu Ziyang nodded and said, “Boss, you think too much. Anyway, I’ve been away for so long. No matter what, I have to go home first.”
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi wanted to part ways with Liu Ziyang, but they didn’t expect three cars to drive over as soon as the three of them arrived at the roadside.
Liu Ziyang smiled and said, “Boss, Zheng Yi, I’ve already made arrangements. I’m going home. Boss will go straight to Yanjing University. Zheng Yi, you go to school too. Each of you will get a car.”
Zheng Yi did not hold back and got into the car. After he got into the car, he stuck his head out and said, “I didn’t expect to receive such treatment as well. I’m leaving first. I’ll contact you again after school starts tomorrow.”
After saying that, he told the driver to drive off. Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang said to Mo Xiu, “Boss, I’m going home to see my dad first. I’ll go to school to look for you later.”
“Good. I’ll check out the school first. I’ll see you later.”
Mo Xiu got into the car and said to the driver, “Let’s go to Yanjing University.”
The driver was a young man in his twenties. He looked very smart.
“Alright, Boss, let me introduce myself. My name is Zhang Qiang. You can call me Qiang Zi.”
Mo Xiu asked curiously, “Why are you calling me Boss?”
Qiang Zi started the car and looked at the rearview mirror. “I asked Young Master Liu. He said to call you Boss.”
“Liu Ziyang… Let’s set off. How long will it take to get there?”
Qiang Zi touched the steering wheel with both hands. A sense of confidence arose in him.
“Ten minutes. Sit tight.”
Ten minutes?
Mo Xiu was a little puzzled. He had checked the route before coming here. It would take at least 30 minutes from the train station to Yanjing University. Could it be that they were flying over in 10 minutes?
However, as soon as the car started, Mo Xiu understood. Although the car wasn’t flying, it was close.
Qiang Zi drove too quickly and was very agile. There were some traffic jams in Yanjing at this time, but Qiang Zi could always find a gap to pass through. Thus, this journey was smooth.
Ten minutes later — the journey really took exactly ten minutes — they arrived at the entrance of Yanjing University.
Qiang Zi was not only fast, but he was also very stable. Mo Xiu did not feel uncomfortable at such a fast speed.
This was not something a normal person could do. Out of curiosity, Mo Xiu activated God’s Eye on Qiang Zi.
“First Skill: Driving.”
“Skill Effect: When driving a car, all spiritual attributes of the user will be increased by 50%, and driving skills will be significantly improved.”
“Duration: Four hours.”
“Cooldown: One hour.”
“Second Skill: Mastery.”
“Skill: The user will master the use of all transportation tools and equipment. The user’s learning ability will also increase by 50%.”
“Duration: One hour.”
“Cooldown: Three hours.”
“Third Skill: Agility.”
“Skill Effect: Increases the user’s reaction speed by 50%.”
“Duration: 15 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
After seeing Qiang Zi’s skills, Mo Xiu sighed. It seemed like the heavens wanted him to drive. This was too crazy.
Qiang Zi got off the car with Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu signaled Qiang Zi to go back.
However, Qiang Zi continued to follow Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu asked, “You don’t have to follow me. You can go back first.”
Qiang Zi said, “Boss, I live here.”
“You live here? Are you a student here too?”
Qiang Zi said proudly, “Yeah, I’m already in my third year of university. I’m a support major and work part-time in the Liu Corporation.”
Mo Xiu understood. It seemed as if Liu Ziyang had arranged this on purpose.
“Since you’re a student here, it’ll be easy. Bring me around.”
Normally, school would start tomorrow, but most students coming from other cities would choose to report a day earlier. This was the case for Mo Xiu.
There were too many people at the reporting area, so Mo Xiu wasn’t in a hurry. Instead, he let Qiang Zi bring him around and familiarize himself with the environment.
Slowly, Mo Xiu began to regret his decision. Yanjing University was really too big. It took them more than two hours to walk around it.
The school was divided into three large areas, namely the dormitory area, the martial arts area, and the office area.
After Qiang Zi’s introduction, Mo Xiu roughly understood the composition of Yanjing University.
There was nothing to say about the dormitory area. Students and teachers lived in one area. Students lived in ten of the buildings, while the teachers lived in one building that had a huge cafeteria.
The martial arts area was the largest area. There were a total of fifteen martial arts arenas, each with different uses. In comparison, there were only ten dormitories, which showed how much Yanjing University valued combat ability.
Lastly, the office area was made up of five buildings in total. One of them was a teaching building that was used for theory classes.
According to Qiang Zi, there were only one theory class per week, so there was only one building for such classes.
The remaining four buildings in the office area were reserved for the student union and the clubs. Every student organization could apply for a room for official uses.
When they returned to the reporting area, there were still many people there. Qiang Zi had left because he had something to do. Thus, Mo Xiu could only wait in line obediently.
Perhaps it was because the queue was too long and everyone was bored from waiting. The person in front of Mo Xiu went to talk to Mo Xiu.
“Hey, bro, which department are you going to enroll in? Since we’re queuing up together, if we enroll in the same department, we might be in the same dormitory.”
Mo Xiu asked curiously, “Doesn’t the school automatically allocate our majors?”
Upon hearing that Mo Xiu didn’t know about this, the man turned around and said, “Let me introduce myself, Hao Ren!”
“Ah? You’re a good
person
? I’m Mo Xiu.”
Hao Ren smiled and said, “That’s right. Not only am I called Hao Ren, but I’m also a good person. You don’t even know how to choose a major, so you must not have done your homework. Yanjing University is different from other universities. You can choose which department you want to go to.”
Mo Xiu really didn’t have time to prepare for university during this holiday.
“What if someone chooses blindly?”
Hao Ren’s interest was piqued. “If you want to choose blindly, no one will stop you. Some rich second-generation heirs choose majors with more girls.”
Mo Xiu humbly asked, “In that case, may I know what majors there are?”
Hao Ren held his hands in front of his chest and gestured as he said, “Yanjing University is different from other universities. Yanjing University is divided into five major departments.”
With that, Hao Ren held out five fingers and kept Mo Xiu in suspense.
Mo Xiu cooperatively asked, “What are the five major departments?”
Hao Ren gestured with his right hand and continued, “They are the Assault, Agility, Magic, Support and Esper Departments respectively. After you choose one of the five major departments, you will be immediately assigned to different classes. Take the Support Department for example. One class can have students with investigative and healing skills.”
After Hao Ren’s explanation, Mo Xiu had more or less understood the major departments in Yanjing University.
The five major departments coincided with Wang Yu’s Physique Limit Theory.
The Assault Department would be chosen by those who had a warrior physique, while the Agility Department would be chosen by those with an assassin physique. Meanwhile, students with a mage physique would choose the Magic Department. The Support Department would comprise of students with investigative, medical, and some other special physiques.
As for the Esper Department, it should house those with skills like Yue Yuan’s Five Elements Formation, as well as some special physiques.
Seeing Mo Xiu in deep thought, Hao Ren asked, “Mo Xiu, which department are you going to choose?”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

“Hao Ren” sounds like “good person” in Chinese



                    



Chapter 41: If You ‘re Not Family, You Won I t Enter the Same Door
Translator: 549690339
Moxiu was stunned for a moment before saying, “Power attack type. The other types might not be suitable for me. ‘”‘
Great!” Hao Ren said excitedly.” I’ll choose the power attack system too.
Maybe we can share the same dormitory. ‘”‘
Hao Ren was indeed a good person. He explained the entire process of queuing to Moxiu, and Moxiu was very grateful to him. In the end, they exchanged contact information.
Finally, it was MO Xiu’s turn. The registration area was in a very large classroom with five teachers sitting inside.
MO Xiu entered the classroom and sat in front of a free teacher.
The teacher’s gaze was fixed on the computer screen in front of her. She did not look up at MO Xiu. It seemed that she was a little tired after a day of work.
“Name!”
“MO Xiu!”
When the teacher heard MO Xiu’s name, he raised his head and looked at MO Xiu.
“You are MO Xiu?”
MO Xiu politely replied, “Yes, teacher.’”‘
“Aiya, I looked at the college entrance examination results. You’re very suitable to enter the power attack department.”
“I’ll consider it,” said Moxiu.”
“What’s there to consider? With your skills, which element can you enter if not the power attack system?”
MO Xiu had a confused look on his face, and the teacher was helpless. He took out a piece of paper and handed it to MO Xiu.
“Please fill out this form. After you fill it out, I will assign you a class and dormitory.”
MO Xiu took it and took a look.
” Name, contact details, chosen department, expertise.’
Don’t even think about taking a long time to write, making the teacher feel a little helpless. What was there to think about?
When the teacher saw MO Xiu’s registration form, his eyes almost fell out.
He looked at Moxiu in disbelief and said, “Mo Xiu, is there something wrong with your head? Are you sure you made the right choice?”
MO Xiu glanced at his report and said,””That’s right. Teacher, please help me enter it into the computer. It’s getting late. I still have to go back to the dormitory to clean up.”
The teacher looked at the report form and didn’t say anything for a long time. In the end, he sighed helplessly and entered MO Xiu’s information into the computer.
“The registration is complete. He is in Class 6, and his dorm is Dorm 312 of Dorm 9.”
Moxiu stood up and said to the teacher, “Thank you, teacher. I’m leaving.’”‘
The teacher waved his hand and whispered, “Young people nowadays are simply wasting their talent. ‘”‘
MO Xiu bumped into Hao Ren as soon as he stepped out of the door.
Seeing MO Xiu, Hao Ren immediately walked over and said,””Mo Xiu, which dormitory did you get assigned to? Are you in the same dormitory as me? I’m from Dormitory No. 2, Room 517.”
Hao Ren said in disbelief,” That’s not right. I heard from the teacher that the power attack system is in Building 1 and Building 2. How did you get No. 9?””
“Oh, I forgot to tell you. I suddenly changed my mind just now. I didn’t choose the power attack system.”
“Which one did you choose?” Hao Ren asked in confusion. Agility system?”
In Hao Rents mind, only the agility-type and the power-type were close. If Moxiu didn’t choose the power-type, he would definitely choose the agility-type.
Moxiu shook his head.” No, I chose the support system.’”‘
“What?” Hao Ren asked in shock.!! MO Xiu, are you crazy? Isn’t your skill an offensive skill? Why did you choose the support system?”
“Hehe, didn’t you say so?” MO Xiu laughed strangely. Some rich second-generation heirs like to go to a department with more girls. You also said that there are more girls in the support department.”
Wang Yu had also mentioned this before. Due to the limitations of their physiques, women’s physiques were more inclined towards support and spells, while men’s physiques were more inclined towards warriors and superpowers.
Hao Ren looked at Moxiu up and down and said in disbelief,””Are you a rich second-generation heir? Are you going for girls?”
“What?” MO Xiu smiled. Doesn’t it look like it?”
After saying that, Moxiu turned around and left, leaving Hao Ren with his mouth twitching.
“You really don’t know a person’s heart by his appearance. He looks like a talented person, but I didn’t expect him to be a lecherous person.”
Hao Ren said righteously. He turned around and whispered,””Sigh, I’m jealous. I want to be willful too.”
MO Xiu took his luggage to Building 9. Before he entered, he saw a girl coming out.
He quickly confirmed it. That’s right. This is Building 9. Why would there be a girl coming out?
She stood outside the door for a while and saw a boy coming out. She then went in at ease.
After entering, MO Xiu finally understood. How was this a dormitory? It was clearly an apartment. Every dormitory was independent, so men and women could live in the same building.
Moxiu first reported to the dormitory management office on the first floor. The gatekeeper was an old man who looked to be in his sixties.
He knocked on the door and went straight to the point. “Hello, I’m a new student reporting for the door key.”
Sir System glanced at MO Xiu and said, “Name!””
“My name is MO Xiu. I was assigned to Room 312.”
“I have the final say in this building. Let me tell you a few rules. First, the room must be clean. Although I won’t check the dormitory, I won’t let you off easily if you let me know whose room is messy.”
“Two, you are not allowed to fight anywhere in this building.”
“Third, this building is for men and women. Men and women are not allowed to live in the same bedroom. If you can’t stand it, go out and get a room.”
“Fourth, you have to report that you haven’t returned to the dormitory for a long time.”
After Sir System finished speaking, he handed a key card to Moxiu.
Moxiu took the key card and left silently when he saw that Sir System did not want to speak anymore.
He went up to the third floor and found Room 312. He used the key card to open the door. The moment he entered the room, he felt a familiar feeling.
The entire house was not big, but it was clean and simple. There was a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom, two bedrooms, and a balcony.
Overall, it looked somewhat similar to Moxiu’s old house.
The lights in the living room were on, so his roommate must have arrived before MO Xiu.
MO Xiu called out softly.
“Is anyone there?”
A person ran out from one of the bedrooms. He was shirtless and had a very strong body. He was a whole size bigger than Moxiu.
“I’m here, I’m here. Hello! My name is Dong Fang. You must be my roommate, right?”
After Dong Fang walked closer, MO Xiu realized that this fellow had developed too well. He was more than 1.9 meters tall, and his explosive muscles gave off a sense of oppression.
The last time he saw such a person, it should be Moxiu’s first opponent in the Underground Arena, the Bulldozer.
Although Dong Fang’s figure was frightening, he gave off an inconspicuous feeling. Perhaps it was because of his relatively ordinary appearance and honest voice?
MO Xiu extended his hand and shook Dong Fangwo’s hand.”Hello, my name is
MO Xiu. Are you also a support-type?”
What surprised MO Xiu the most was that Dong Fang looked like a student of the power attack system.
Dong Fang scratched his head awkwardly and said,””Actually, I could have applied for the power attack system, but my mom told me to find a wife in the university. In the end, after thinking about it, I still decided to apply for the support system.”
He didn’t expect that not only was MO Xiu a weirdo, but his roommate was also a weirdo.
MO Xiu suspected that the teacher at the registration office had deliberately divided the students. Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental that two students who were supposed to be power attack students had applied for the support system?
Actually, Moxiu’s true purpose for reporting to the Support System was to secretly research God’s Snooping.
After such a long period of experience, Moxiu knew that God’s Sight wasn’t as simple as it seemed.
In the Underground Arena, Xue Jin’s skill was unable to lock onto Moxiu, which meant that God’s Sight could not be detected.
MO Xiu raised his head and glanced at Dong Fang. It wasn’t like they were all family..Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Chapter 42: School Opening Ceremony
Translator: 549690339
Dong Fang pointed to a bedroom and said,” I came here first. I didn’t know which bedroom to stay in, so I picked one randomly. Look, if you like my room, I’ll give it to you.””
MO Xiu waved his hand and said,” No need. I’ll stay in the other room. Have you eaten?” Let’s go out for a meal?”
“I’ve eaten. I have to sleep. I drove all night yesterday and was busy all day today. I’m a little tired. I’ll treat you to dinner after the opening ceremony tomorrow.”
Moxiu nodded and said,”Alright, you should rest first.’”‘
After saying that, she took her luggage back to her room and packed up.
Liu Ziyang had been calling MO Xiu.
“Boss, where did you go? Why didn’t I find you?” “I’m in Room 312 of Building 9.”
“No. 9 building?” Liu Ziyang exclaimed. Support-type?”
“That’s right.”
“Boss, are you crazy? With your strength, you are the leader of the power attack system. Why would you go to the support system?”
Moxiu found an excuse and said,” In terms of actual combat, Teacher Wang Lei and Teacher Wang Yu have taught me more or less. I want to understand some support skills.””
” Tsk, boss, you’re bad. This is not true. You’re not going to the support system for a girl, right?” Oh my god, Mu Qingyi just left, and you’re already looking for another family?”
MO Xiu couldn’t be bothered with him and said,” Come and find me. Let’s go out for a meal.”
After hanging up the phone, Liu Ziyang quickly found MO Xiu. The two of them went to the cafeteria together.
It was six o’clock in the evening. Due to the large number of new students today, the huge canteen was a little crowded.
Moxiu searched for a long time before finding an empty seat for two.
Liu Ziyang said,” There are too many people here. I’m going to buy something to eat. Why don’t you reserve a seat here?”
MO Xiu nodded in agreement. He took advantage of the time Liu Ziyang left to look around.
He noticed a girl in a fiery red dress sitting at the table next to him. The more he looked at her, the stranger he felt.
This girl’s dress was completely out of place with the others. The style of her red dress was very similar to Han clothes. Her facial features were exquisite and could be considered a first-class beauty, but no one came over to talk to her. No one even dared to share a table.
The girl seemed to have noticed Moxiu peeking at her. She suddenly turned her head to look at Moxiu. Her gaze was like a sharp blade.
Moxiu secretly thought that this person was not to be trifled with. However, it was not easy to avoid being discovered, so he could only smile back.
The girl in red seemed to have sensed that Moxiu didn’t have any ill intentions. After giving him a warning look, she continued eating.
MO Xiu didn’t look at her anymore. It was already very unreasonable to stare at a girl, and now that he was discovered, he was naturally embarrassed to look at her again.
Liu Ziyang came back with a plate of dishes and said excitedly, “Boss, I didn’t expect the dishes here to be so good.”
MO Xiu took a look. There were a total of four dishes, and they all looked pretty good.
The two of them were about to start eating. Moxiu picked up his chopsticks and was about to add more food when a hand appeared and hit Moxiu’s elbow.
MO Xiu was caught off guard. He threw his chopsticks on the ground and looked up. Three men were looking at MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang with dissatisfaction.
Liu Ziyang immediately got angry. He slammed the table and stood up. “What do you mean? Are you looking for trouble?”
The leader of the three said,”This is our seat. Hurry up and make way. We’re going to eat.””
Moxiu bent down to pick up the chopsticks that had fallen to the ground and placed them on the table. He turned his head to look at the three of them. “We’re already eating here. Why do you say that this seat is yours?”
“Because I ate here yesterday, so this seat is mine.””
‘ Then I’ll be eating here today,” Moxiu said.” From now on, this seat will be mine. You didn’t manage to keep an eye on it, so I’m sorry.’”‘
That person stretched out his hand and grabbed towards MO Xiu. MO Xiu
leaned back and dodged, but that person missed and grabbed at him with his other hand.
Moxiu grabbed his hand and pulled him down, causing him to fall to the ground.
The person laughed after falling down. He got up and said to Moxiu,”Kid, you’re hitting people in the canteen. Are you tired of living? I’m in pain all over. If you don’t pay, I’ll report it to the school. If you fight in the cafeteria, you’ll be suspended or expelled.”
MO Xiu’s brows were tightly knitted together. It seemed like this group of people was deliberately finding fault with him just to extort money.
“I didn’t expect that even Yanjing University would have a scum like you.” That person did not want to be outdone. He directly lay on the ground and shouted.
‘ Aiya, beating someone up! A new student who just arrived is already beating someone up! Is there anyone who can stop me?!”‘
The two people who came with this person also cooperated very well. One of them went up to help him, while the other pointed at Moxiu and shouted,”That’s right. I saw it clearly just now. It was this person who hit him.”
MO Xiu sighed softly. What was going on? She didn’t want to come over for a meal, so she looked up at Liu Ziyang and let him settle it.
Liu Ziyang was originally watching the show with a smile. These people were really interesting. When he saw MO Xiu looking over, he immediately understood that they wanted him to deal with them.
Before Liu Ziyang could pick up the phone, a cold and emotionless female voice was heard.
“Get lost! ”
The three people who were acting immediately got up from the ground and looked around to find the source of the voice.
In the end, everyone’s gaze was locked onto the red-dressed girl.
When the three of them saw the girl, they were shocked and immediately walked over to bow and apologize.
“Sister Xiao Hong, I didn’t know you were here. Sorry for disturbing your meal.”
Xiao Hong glanced at MO Xiu and said to them,””Didn’t you hear what I said just now?”
“Get lost, get lost!”
The three of them ran quickly and disappeared in a moment.
MO Xiu didn’t expect this red-robed woman named Xiao Hong to be so awesome. He was glad that he didn’t offend her.
Since he had helped, he naturally had to thank him. MO Xiu stood up and wanted to go over, but he was pulled back by Liu Ziyang.
MO Xiu didn’t understand, but he still sat down opposite Xiao Hong.
“Thank you for your help just now.”
Seeing MO Xiu sit down, Xiao Hong frowned slightly. She was clearly unhappy and placed her chopsticks on the table. It seemed like she wouldn’t eat anymore.
Xiao Hong ignored MO Xiu and stood up to say to Liu Ziyang,’”‘Liu Ziyang, is this your boss? You have the same bad taste as your father.”
After saying that, he turned around and left. MO Xiu sat back down awkwardly.
“What happened? You know him?”
Liu Ziyang said helplessly,” Boss, don’t ask about this. I can’t even afford to offend her. If you meet her in the future, just hide if you can.”
MO Xiu curiously looked in the direction Xiao Hong had left. What kind of place was Yanjing University? What kind of place was Yanjing?
The two of them were not in the mood to do such a thing. They hurriedly ate and went back to the dormitory to sleep.
The next morning, MO Xiu didn’t look for Liu Ziyang. The two of them weren’t from the same faculty, and the opening ceremony wasn’t arranged for them to sit together.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang went out together. After breakfast, the two of them headed straight for the first training field. The opening ceremony was held there.
MO Xiu looked very petite when he walked with Dong Fang, and the number of people who turned their heads along the way was not low.
Upon entering the first training field, MO Xiu was stunned. Wasn’t this too exaggerated?
This stadium was the largest in the world. There was nothing inside except for the middle area and countless chairs around it.
According to the data given by the teacher yesterday, MO Xiu and Dong Fang came to the designated area of the Support Department and sat down.
It didn’t take long for people to arrive one after another, filling up the entire martial arts field.
With a resounding voice, Moxiu’s university life began.
“The opening ceremony officially begins!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Chapter 43: Support
Translator: 549690339
“The opening ceremony has officially begun. First, let’s introduce the history of Yanjing University. Our school was the first school to reopen after the war. Our school…
Moxiu thought that the opening ceremony would talk about some very important things, but it was actually just an introduction of the school’s history and some of the school’s rules. There was nothing else.
In summary, there were the following points:
Firstly, the school’s education method was relatively free, and there was a lot of free training time.
Second, the school’s education competition was mainly based on theory.
Third, the school encouraged duels and challenges, but it was forbidden for seniors to challenge juniors unless they had permission from the juniors.
Fourth, look for the form teacher if there’s anything.
There were only a few rules in total. The first one said that you needed to work hard on your own. The second one meant that the education was completely based on actual combat. The third one was to protect the lower grade students. After all, one more skill meant that they would be stronger.
The opening ceremony ended in less than two hours. After it ended, every class began to gather.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang were both from Class 6. The two of them came to a field in the No. 3 training ground.
A lazy man sat at the front. Seeing that almost everyone had arrived, he shouted,” Support class six, gather!”
MO Xiu took a rough look. There were a total of 50 people in Class Six. Indeed, there were more girls, accounting for about three-quarters of the entire class.
“My name is Cao Fenglin, I’m your class teacher. You heard what I said at the opening ceremony. The education of Yanjing University is based on competition. The entire university life is a competition.”
“Cough cough! The types of competitions were divided into individual battles and team battles. Sometimes, a pair battle would be added.”
“There are two organizers for the competition. The first is the school’s official competition. It’s held once every school year and is divided into class battles, department selection battles, school selection battles, and national battles.”
“The second is the student council’s group battle. It will be held within the school. If you want to improve your combat ability, it is recommended to join a group. Because our support system is the weakest in the school, but we are popular in the group. If you want to get good results and represent the school, you have to practice more.”
“Next, I’ll talk about the advancement method. Two people will form a group for the inter-class battle. The first two groups will advance to the selection battle of the faculty.”
“The class selection will begin now. Do you have any questions? Good! If not, then let’s start, huff!”
He recited the entire competition as if he was reading a script. After he finished, he even let out a long sigh as if he was finally relieved.
MO Xiu didn’t expect Cao Fenglin to be so perfunctory. This was a teacher from Yanjing University, but why did he feel that he was inferior to his high school form teacher, Gao Quan?
After Cao Fenglin finished speaking, he sat down at the side. After a while, he realized that none of his classmates had moved.
“Why aren’t you guys starting?
A short-haired girl standing at the front of the class said, “Teacher, how are we going to compete? Also, how do we group them?”
Cao Fenglin narrowed his eyes and said impatiently,””What’s your name?”
“My name is Mu Mu,” the short-haired girl said.”
“Alright, you are the class monitor now. You will organize the competition and divide the groups according to the dormitory. Each dormitory will form a team.”
MO Xiu and Dong Fang looked at each other. Wasn’t this teacher too casual? Was this really the best school?
Mu Mu was also a little helpless, so he could only brace himself and organize the group.
There was no way he could do that. The cooldown time of a level 1 skill was three hours, and there were less than two hours before lunch.
In other words, most people could only use their skills in the first match. The cooldown for the rest of the match had not ended yet, so they could not use them again.
Mu Mu asked everyone to divide into groups and then said,””Does anyone have any suggestions? Is there any way to choose the two strongest groups within two hours?”
Everyone fell silent. Only one battle could be fought. How could they determine which two teams were the strongest? How can we be fair?
Even if the fastest elimination round was used, there would be a total of 50 people and 25 teams. After the first round, there would be 13 teams left. Most people would not be able to continue using their skills in the remaining matches. It was simply unfair.
MO Xiu looked at the silent crowd and stood up.
“Actually, everyone is thinking too complicated. It’s fairest to only have one match, so let’s just have one.”
Mu Mu frowned and said, “It’s easy to say, but there’s only one match. How can we choose two?” Could it be…
MO Xiu walked to the front.” That’s right. It seems like the class monitor has already thought it through. There’s only one answer. It’s a battle royale. The last two teams will be the winners.”
Everyone started discussing this idea. Cao Fenglin also glanced at MO Xiu.
From the moment Moxiu thought things through, he knew that Cao Fenglin wasn’t simple.
The students had to think of their own ways. In the end, this was the only way.
The free-for-all might not be fair to the other Elements, but this was the Support Element. It was very difficult for the Support Element to be fair.
On one hand, it was difficult to group them. If two people were in a group, who knew if these two people were pure healers? Without attack-type students, the support-type students would not be able to display their full strength.
On the other hand, it was also unfair to have two people in a group. This way, only the two groups with the strongest combat ability would be selected, and not the people with the most practical support skills.
Therefore, the battle royals in the support system were the fairest. It tested the students ‘combat ability and the support’s ability to adapt. When should they support whom?
After everyone unanimously agreed, Mu Mu announced that they would use MO Xiu’s method, a battle royale!
“Since no one has any objections, shall we begin the competition?” Mu Mu said.”
“I have an objection!” Moxiu raised his hand and said.”
Mu Mu was stunned. What was going on? Weren’t you the one who suggested the free-for-all? Why do you have objections now?
“What’s your problem?” Mu Mu asked in confusion.”
MO Xiu looked at Cao Fenglin and said,” Teacher, I have a suggestion. I don’t
Imow if I can say it!””
Cao Fenglin still looked lazy as he said,””Speak! What suggestion?” “I don’t think it’s fair for each dormitory to have one group.
what do you think is the fairest?”
“Is the purpose of the class selection to choose two teams of four?” asked MO
Xiu. ”
Cao Fenglin nodded.” That’s right. There are four of them.”‘
MO Xiu smiled and said,”Then why don’t you give me something more exciting?” We won’t split into groups and fight on our own. The last four people will win. How about it?”
Cao Fenglin’s interest was piqued when he heard MO Xiu’s words. He stood up and walked towards MO Xiu.
“Good, good! You’re interesting, kid. I like you. Let’s advance according to what you said. There’s no need to divide into teams. Everyone will fight for themselves. The last four people will come!”
It was fairest for everyone to fight for themselves. This was especially important for judging the situation on the field.
As soon as the match began, everyone was an enemy, and at the same time, everyone could be teammates.
Whether they were friend or foe was entirely up to them. In a battle between two people, it was entirely up to them to decide who to buff.
This was also the most important thing for support-type people, other than the strength of their skills, their judgment and adaptability!
A good Support might not be the leader, but they were definitely the ones who could judge the situation.
Cao Fenglin’s interest was piqued.. He stood at the side of the arena and shouted,””Competition…Begin!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!

                    



Chapter 44: Controlling the Situation
Translator: 549690339
“Let the competition begin!”
As Cao Fenglin’s voice faded, the competition officially began.
At the start of the match, everyone took a step back and did not rush to attack. They wanted to see the situation on the field.
For a moment, no one made a move. The arena was in a deadlock because everyone knew in their hearts that whoever made the first move at this time would be the target of everyone.
The silence didn’t last long before it was broken by a bespectacled girl.
She did not make a move. Instead, she pointed at Moxiu and said, “Everyone, listen to me. He’s from Shun City like me. He’s the top scorer of the college entrance examination, and his skills are very likely to be extremely aggressive.”
Moxiu widened his eyes as he looked at this girl. He had no impression of her at all. This way, Moxiu would have no way to quibble. Everyone would definitely attack her together. He didn’t expect to shoot himself in the foot.
As expected, after hearing the girl’s words, everyone hesitated for a second before attacking Moxiu together.
Moxiu had no choice but to activate the Descent of the Martial God. His entire body flashed with golden light as he quickly flashed to the other side of the arena.
At this time, he could not be careless. The people here were all support skills. If all these skills were added to one person, the skills would be ever-changing. He might not be a match for them.
MO Xiu slowed down and started to face the enemy head-on. After two moves, he discovered that the people in front of him had skills, but there was no situation where many skills were stacked on one person.
After thinking about it for a while, he understood that although he was the public enemy now, even if he was eliminated, the others would still continue to fight for the rest of the time. No one wanted to make a wedding dress for others.
Those who could cast support skills on themselves would definitely do so on themselves. If they could not, they would definitely buff each other or cast them on people who were not in a state. After all, no one wanted to create a powerful enemy.
This way, the pressure on Moxiu was greatly reduced. With the buff of the War God’s Descent, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to fight against these support-type people.
However, Support players generally had very strong physiques because they did not have strong self-defense abilities. They could only use their own speed and strength to fight against the enemy.
Those who could enter Yanjing University were definitely outstanding, so their combat strength was much stronger than ordinary people. MO Xiu didn’t have it easy either.
Moxiu frowned. Even if he was much stronger than the others, there were simply too many people on the other side. There were already more than 30 people who had joined the battle.
Fortunately, these people weren’t sincere in their cooperation. Occasionally, some of them would be ambushed, and the battle behind them would become chaotic, reducing some of the pressure on Moxiu.
Just as Moxiu was feeling vexed, the situation on the field changed. Six people suddenly helped Moxiu fight against the others.
MO Xiu took a closer look. It was Dong Fang, the class monitor Mu Mu, and three women and a man. MO Xiu didn’t recognize them.
At this point, the situation on the battlefield became clear. There were only two factions.
Moxiu’s side had seven people, while the other side had thirty-eight people. Eleven people were eliminated.
Cao Fenglin was very satisfied with the battle and nodded his head slightly.
Of course, the person who helped MO Xiu wasn’t looking at MO Xiu pitifully.
It was because they were stronger than the others. After the others defeated Moxiu, they would definitely join forces to attack them. They had no choice but to help Moxiu and form a temporary alliance.
The girl who had just pointed out MO Xiu said,”Students who haven’t used any skills, give me all your amplification skills. I’ll deal with Moxiu, and you guys deal with the others.”
As soon as this girl said this, many people added their skills to her. It was not because she was trustworthy, but because the benefits and risks were proportional. Although she received more skills, she would face the strongest Moxiu.
The match entered a white-hot stage. The battle on the field was extremely intense, and there were players who were eliminated at any time. The bespectacled girl had indeed exchanged blows with Moxiu, but after only two moves, she felt that she was unable to defeat Moxiu and retreated.
From this moment on, Moxiu began to slaughter in all directions. With six helpers, Moxiu could harvest as much as he wanted.
There was another person who was invincible in the crowd, and that was Dong Fang. Dong Fang’s skill was very strange. After he released it, his entire body turned golden. It seemed that it had increased his defense and attack power.
Moxiu had originally wanted to take the bait in the middle of the scuffle before attacking. He did not expect that because of the bespectacled girl’s report, he would have to fight with all his might from the start.
However, there was also an advantage to this, which was that he had learned more strange skills.
Moxiu had personally seen a person making strange movements like rubber. This should have increased his flexibility by a lot.
There were also those who immediately recovered and continued fighting after being knocked down and injured.
There was also a girl called He Lingyue on MO Xiu’s side. Her attack power was average, but her speed and agility were insane.
Moxiu believed that his speed was definitely faster than hers, but her agility was too terrifying. It was as if she knew what her opponent was going to do next and dodged in advance. She was not hit even once in the chaotic battle.
As time passed, the number of people on the stage decreased, and the elimination rate increased.
The bespectacled girl started by testing MO Xiu, then she started to fish in troubled waters in the middle, and then she started to attack the weakest student in the later stages.
“You… I just increased your speed. You can’t eliminate me. You said that you would deal with Moxiu.”
” This is a solo battle,” the girl said.” There’s no real alliance. If I can’t beat him, do I have to die?’”‘ ‘You…”
“I’m sorry.”
As the bespectacled girl switched sides, the main force did not have any top-notch combat strength and was quickly defeated.
Two minutes later, there were only five people left on the field.
MO Xiu, Dong Fang, Mu Mu, He Lingyue, and the bespectacled girl.
With one more person eliminated, the remaining four people would advance. At this moment, the five people stopped and looked at each other.
Moxiu was the most relaxed. He walked to the side of the arena and sat down, looking at the other four.
At this moment, the bespectacled girl said,” The current situation is very obvious. Moxiu is the strongest here. We just need to join forces to defeat him and we can advance. With the strength of the four of us, there shouldn’t be any problem.”
MO Xiu looked at the bespectacled girl carefully. What kind of grudge did this person have against him? From the beginning to the end, he had been targeting him.
Moxiu looked at the time and said,”Hurry up and end the match as soon as possible. ‘”‘
Dong Fang, Mu Mu, and He Lingyue looked at each other.
Mu Mu said to the bespectacled girl,” Alright, we agree. However, you betrayed us before. We can’t trust you completely. You’ll take the lead. We’ll take down Moxiu together.’”‘
The bespectacled girl was very satisfied with this answer. It seemed that the situation had been turned around this time.
The bespectacled girl nodded and ran towards Moxiu. The other three followed closely behind.
MO Xiu didn’t move. He remained seated on the spot, looking rather lazy. “Moxiu, you’re done for!” The bespectacled girl shouted.”
Before he could finish his sentence, the three people behind him attacked together. They did not attack Moxiu, but the bespectacled girl. They quickly knocked her to the ground.
At this moment, Cao Fenglin said, ” The name list for the advancement is out. The four of them are MO Xiu, Dong Fang, Mu Mu, and He Lingyue.””
The bespectacled girl said to Moxiu in disbelief, “What happened? You knew that the three of them would attack me? Are they your people?”
MO Xiu smiled as he stood up and walked to the center of the arena.
“There are a total of five people on the stage. As long as one of them is eliminated, the others will advance. Then, who would choose to fight the strongest one? When you said that you wanted to join forces to defeat the both of us, you had already lost!”
“You think that you have the hearts of the people and control the situation, but in fact, you are too involved to see!”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Chapter 45: Encyclopedia Hao Ren
Translator: 549690339
The bespectacled girl was stunned by MO Xiu’s words. However, not long after, she started shouting at Cao Fenglin again.
“Teacher, I don’t agree with the results of this competition. MO Xiu and Dong
Fang are not support skills at all.”
“It’s a waste of time talking to people like you.” MO Xiu sighed.”
The bespectacled girl glared fiercely at MO Xiu.
Cao Fenglin had a serious expression on his face.” This student, did you not hear the rules I explained at the beginning?” The remaining four people would be the ones who advanced!”
Seeing that the teacher was a little angry, the bespectacled girl stopped talking.
Cao Fenglin gathered everyone and said,””The class selection has ended, and the names of the four who have advanced have been confirmed. From now on, there will be no classes for the next half a month.”
“Teacher, does that mean that those of us who didn’t advance have no chance?” asked another student.”
This student asked what everyone was thinking. If it was decided on the first day that they could not participate in the competition this semester, wouldn’t it be a little too cruel?
“Didn’t you guys hear what they said at the opening ceremony?” Cao Fenglin asked. Yanjing University’s education was based on competition. Everyone had a chance.”
“There will be a class competition every month. The four winners can challenge the students who have already advanced. If they win, they can replace the students who have advanced.”
“Due to the special circumstances of our support system, some students with outstanding skills may be directly selected by the teachers to advance. Everyone, don’t relax. Everyone has a chance, and at the same time, everyone may fall behind.”
After hearing this, MO Xiu couldn’t help but sigh at the teaching methods of Yanjing University.
It seemed like there were no restrictions, but in reality, there was competition everywhere, making it impossible for people to relax for a moment.
Cao Fenglin continued,” Half a month later, the four who have advanced will go to the faculty for the selection. The rest will come here for the inter-class competition. Alright, you are dismissed!’”‘
For most people, their college life began in such a cruel way.
“MO Xiu, wait!”
Cao Fenglin called out to MO Xiu. MO Xiu told Dong Fang to go eat first and stayed behind alone.
“Teacher, why are you looking for me?”
Cao Fenglin looked at his phone and said, “You’re the top scorer of this year’s college entrance examination?””
“Yes, Teacher.” MO Xiu nodded.”
“With your skills, you would be the best in the power attack system. Why did you choose the support system?”
“For women! ” “Nonsense!” “To relax!”
“Nonsense!”
“I chose it randomlv!”
“Nonsense! A commoner kid who got into Yanjing University through hard work. Why would he choose randomly?”
Moxiu shook his head helplessly and said seriously,””l want to form a team!”
Cao Fenglin’s eyes widened. What kind of team?”
MO Xiu puffed out his chest and said word by word,””An invincible team, a team that can sweep away everything in the world.”
Cao Fenglin narrowed his eyes and didn’t say anything.
MO Xiu thought that Cao Fenglin still had doubts and continued,””Because of this reason, I chose the support system. The support of a team is especially important. I also want to learn how to support thinking and be an outstanding leader!”
Cao Fenglin waved his hand and said,” Alright, I understand. You may leave.’”‘
Moxiu walked out of the No. 3 training ground and felt relieved. He could finally relax now. This reason was enough to dispel the doubts of others.
Actually, what Moxiu had said just now was not completely fabricated. Moxiu had thought about all these things. While he could make friends with more people, he could also train himself.
“Ring, ring, ring…”
The phone rang and MO Xiu picked it up. It was Liu Ziyang.
“Boss, where are you? Have you eaten? I just finished class. Let’s have a meal together?”
MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang had agreed to meet in the cafeteria. This time, there weren’t that many people in the cafeteria, so the two of them randomly found a seat and sat down.
“Boss, isn’t Yanjing University too tiring?” Liu Ziyang said with a tired face.” “Tired? Where are you tired?”
“There are 60 students in our class, and we’re going to have the inter-class competition,” Liu Ziyang said weakly.”
“Me too. I’ve already chosen the list of people who will advance to the next round.”
“What? How? Why so fast?”
“In the free-for-all, the last four people have advanced.”
Liu Ziyang raised his thumb and nodded repeatedly.”Awesome, we need to fight for half a month to confirm the advancement list.”
“A round every day?”
“Yes, I am!”
“It won’t take more than half a month, right?”
“In the remaining days, the losers will challenge each other. Only the four winners can defend the arena to advance.”
The image of Cao Fenglin’s lazy appearance appeared in MO Xiu’s mind. It seemed like it had something to do with the form teacher. The reason why class six’s selection method was so simple was definitely because Cao Fenglin had made his own decisions.
When MO Xiu found out that the entire school’s class had the same idea of the same thing as Liu Ziyang’s, he instantly felt like he had been cheated. How did he end up with such a class teacher?
“Boss, the club is recruiting this afternoon. Which club are you going to join?” Liu Ziyang asked MO Xiu.”
MO Xiu looked at Liu Ziyang and then held his head. This Cao Fenglin didn’t even mention the club’s recruitment.
“I don’t know either. What clubs are there?”
Liu Ziyang quickly ate the rice in his bowl and stood up.”l’m not sure either. Shall we go and take a look now?”
MO Xiu was also a little curious about the club. The main reason was that for the next half a month, everyone else would be in the class selection competition. He had nothing to do.
The two of them came to the front of the teaching building, which was now surrounded by people.
MO Xiu squeezed his way in with much difficulty. He realized that there were rows of tables and chairs inside, and there was a person sitting in front of each table. It was probably the club’s recruitment registration office.
Looking around, MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang had no clue. They were a little dizzy from looking at the various clubs.
At this moment, a familiar figure appeared in front of Moxiu and walked past him.
MO Xiu’s eyes were sharp and his hands were fast as he grabbed the ball.
“Hao Ren, what a coincidence!”
Seeing that it was MO Xiu, Hao Ren said excitedly,””Mo Xiu? I’ve asked around. You’re actually the top scorer of the college entrance examination, and you’ve easily obtained the qualifications to enter the internal department selection.” “You’re quite well-informed, aren’t you?” Moxiu was stunned for a moment.”
Hao Ren raised his right thumb and pointed at himself.””Of course. I’m famous,
Hao Ren from the Encyclopedia.”
Halfway through his sentence, he saw Liu Ziyang beside MO Xiu and asked,””And this is?”
MO Xiu glanced at Liu Ziyang and said, “This is my friend, Liu Ziyang.”” “Hiss! But the son of the Liu Corporation, Liu Ziyang?”
Liu Ziyang smiled and said, “It’s really an encyclopedia. Even I know about it.””
Hao Ren quickly shook hands with Liu Yang and said,””Of course. A small character like me has to know who not to mess with in Yanjing University.
You’re one of them.”
Liu Ziyang said proudly,” Of course, but you look good. If there’s anything in the future, just tell me.””
Hao Ren was overjoyed and shook his hand again.””Thank you, Young Master
Liu, for taking care of me,”
Then, he said to Moxiu,”You two are here to join the club, right?” MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang nodded together.
Hao Ren looked at the time and said,” Let me introduce you guys.” This was MO Xiu’s goal. He immediately said, “That’s exactly what I want..”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Chapter 46: The Strongest Club
Translator: 549690339
Hao Ren didn’t mind and said,””What kind of club do you want to join?”
“Liu Ziyang and I don’t really know what kind of clubs there are.’”‘
“Hmm… There were three main types of clubs. The first type was a restricted club with certain recruitment restrictions. For example, it only recruited students from the power attack department.”
“The second type is a hodgepodge club. As long as you are strong enough, you can join. The team formed by such a club is more balanced, and it is also the club with the largest number.”
“The third type of club is a local club. For example, if you come from Shun City, there is a Shun City club.”
“Then the strongest one should be a hodgepodge club, right?’”‘
Hao Ren shook his hand.” Not necessarily. There are six clubs in our school, and four of them are restricted clubs.’”‘
“Six clubs?” Liu Ziyang asked. What are there?”
“Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Yanjing, and
Chenxi. These six clubs have always been the strongest in Yanjing University.”
“Among them, the Four Divine Beasts Society is a single-attribute society.
Azure Dragon only recruits males, Vermillion Bird only recruits females, White Tiger only recruits agility-type students, and Black Tortoise only recruits assault-type students.”
“The Yanjing Club represents the strength of Yanjing. There are countless masters in it. Finally, there is Chenxi. Chenxi is known as the Dawn of Yanjing University. They are also top existences.”
MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang more or less understood. This club seemed to be messy, but in reality, there were so many divisions.
Hao Ren continued,” With your strength, I suggest you join the six major clubs.
First, you can train yourself. Second, you can make a name for yourself.” “Does the club restrict freedom?” asked MO Xiu.’
Hao Ren replied,” No, but there will be a tryout near the competition. It’s more troublesome. Although the official competition time is staggered with the school’s official competition time, most people who advance in both the school competition and the club competition will give up one of them.”
MO Xiu also started to think. If the official competition was staggered, then the time of the club selection would definitely clash with the school’s official competition. Therefore, most people would focus on one side. What should they do?
Don’t even think about participating in as many competitions as possible instead of wasting time on the qualifiers.
Liu Ziyang sneakily asked Hao Ren,””Are men really not allowed in the
Vermilion Bird Club?”
“I didn’t expect Brother Liu to…” Hao Ren asked with a strange smile. Ahem, I’m afraid not. The Vermilion Bird Club doesn’t accept any boys. You should apply for the support system like MO Xiu.”
Liu Ziyang tidied his clothes and pretended to be profound.”Hao Ren, I was just joking. Do you think a man like me would lack women?”
Hao Ren gave her a thumbs up and said that she was awesome.
After that, Liu Ziyang went around alone and returned five minutes later with a head full of sweat.
“What’s wrong?” asked MO Xiu. Who was chasing after him?
Liu Ziyang said with lingering fear,” Don’t mention it. I was just about to go for a walk. When I walked to the Vermilion Bird Club’s registration office, I saw Xiao Hong. Fortunately, I ran fast. Otherwise, I might have died there.””
Hao Ren widened his eyes and cupped his fists in admiration.””lmpressive, impressive. Brother Liu is indeed a big shot. You even have connections with people like Xiao Hong.”
MO Xiu looked at Hao Ren and thought,” Isn’t this flattery too much?
At this moment, Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren both looked at MO Xiu, waiting for his decision on which club to join.
Hao Ren felt that he had nothing to do with this and was ready to leave.
“Um, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving. I’ll contact you later.” MO Xiu suddenly came back to his senses and stopped Hao Ren.
“Wait a minute, Brother Hao Ren, I still have something to ask.”
Hahaha!” Hao Ren laughed heartily.” Ask me anything. I’ll tell you everything I know.””
“How do I create a club? Can I create it now that I’m a freshman?”
Hao Ren was surprised and quickly said,””Mo Xiu, with your strength, why did you create your own club? Now that the clubs in Yanjing University were basically stable, there was no room for new clubs to develop. Only those who couldn’t enter the top clubs and were unwilling to join other clubs would create clubs.”
“Oh?” MO Xiu asked. Are these people’s clubs not developing well?”
Of course not, good, bad, too many problems, one, can’t recruit people, two, there are too few people in the club after recruiting people, no competition.”
MO Xiu clapped his hands and said,” That’s great. I want a club like this. Tell me quickly. how do you create a club?””
Hao Ren looked at Moxiu as if he was an idiot. This guy was too weird. The top scorer of offensive skills joined the support class, and he could choose any club he wanted. However, he created a useless club himself.
“The building next to the teaching building. The first floor is the student union.
There is a club management office.”
MO Xiu held his chin as he pondered. Five people? She suddenly looked up at
Hao Ren.
“Brother Hao Ren, do you have a club now?” Hao Ren took two steps back.
Student Union, Club Management Office.
At this moment, a staff member was receiving MO Xiu. “Have you thought it through? Create a club?”
“I’ve thought about it,” Moxiu replied.
The staff member looked at the four people behind Moxiu who had not spoken and said,”Are you all willing?
They were Liu Ziyang, Hao Ren, Dong Fang, and He Lingyue.
This was almost everyone that MO Xiu knew in university. He had wanted to invite class monitor Mu Mu, but when he found Mu Mu, she had already joined the Vermilion Bird Club.
“I’ll ask you again. Are you guys willing?”
Seeing that the four of them did not answer, MO Xiu lightly coughed a few times.
“Cough, cough, cough!”
Liu Ziyang had no choice but to say,””Yes, I volunteered.”
Seeing Liu Ziyang express his stance, the others followed suit.
The staff always felt that this group of people was strange, but it didn’t matter. After all, this kind of club would usually disband within a month.
“Are there any requirements for joining the club?”
MO Xiu replied,”No!”
“What is the name of the club?”
MO Xiu scratched his head. He really hadn’t thought about this. He turned around and looked at the four of them. The four of them had the look of ‘you decide.’
MO Xiu was overwhelmed. What kind of name should he come up with? He couldn’t be too casual and too high-profile.
At this moment, MO Xiu’s phone rang. It was Zheng Yi.
He thought to himself, Zheng Yi, this kid, has come at the right time. This kid has many ideas.
” Wait a moment,” Moxiu said to the staff.” I’ll take this call and ask my friend for his opinion. I’ll get back to you immediately.’”‘
The staff was getting impatient. It was so difficult for these five people to create a club for fun.
“Zheng Yi, your call came at the right time.”
Zheng Yi casually said,” You’re too busy. You don’t know how to call me and ask me how I’m doing. What’s the matter?’”‘
“I want to create a club. What do you think it should be called?”
Zheng Yi said excitedly,” F * ck, that’s awesome. He even created a club. Let me think…” I got it!” What?!”
Strongest Club!”
MO Xiu thought he had heard wrongly and repeated himself.
“What? The strongest club?”
The staff member at the side quickly filled out the declaration form and said to the few of them,”Alright, the club has been successfully created. There are no recruitment restrictions. Strongest Club, Club Number: 666!”
The few of them looked at each other. Wasn’t this too ridiculous? “Moxiu, can I still quit now?” Hao Ren raised his hand and asked..”Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Chapter 47: New Mission
Translator: 549690339
“Hello?” Zheng Yi called out over the phone. Hello? MO Xiu? Why aren’t you talking?”
MO Xiu and the others walked out of the management office before sighing and saying to Zheng Yi,’”‘l’ll hang up first. You’re really my good brother.”
“Of course, between the two of us…”
“Beep! Beep! Beep!”
After MO Xiu hung up, he said to Liu Ziyang and the others,”l’m sorry for the accident, but the club has been established, so this is the only way.”
Hao Ren, Liu Ziyang, and Dong Fang all looked bitter and reluctant.
Only He Lingyue, who MO Xiu was not familiar with, spoke up for MO Xiu.
“Actually…l think the strongest club is not that bad. It’s still acceptable.”
MO Xiu pointed at He Lingyue and praised, “”Look, you three old masters, look at how enlightened he is. This is called enlightenment. If he can accept it, why can’t you?”
Liu Ziyang still felt very uncomfortable.” Boss, I don’t think this name is bad.
It’s just that this name is too pretentious. It’s easy to become a target for others. ‘”‘
“Hey, why did we create this club?” Moxiu said earnestly. What do you think it’s
MO Xiu pointed at Hao Ren, signaling him to answer.
“To prove yourself?” Hao Ren asked.”
MO Xiu nodded his head affirmatively.” Sigh, that’s the point. Why did we come to Yanjing University?” You need to become stronger in order to grow faster under pressure. Liu Ziyang, you’re still not aware enough.”
After Moxiu finished speaking, he walked forward by himself. After this persuasion, everyone reluctantly accepted the fact that they were the strongest club.
Confused, Hao Ren asked Liu Ziyang,””Sigh, why do I feel that MO Xiu is different from usual? How could someone with such high awareness enter the support system?”
Liu Ziyang shook his head and said, “Mo Xiu calls himself MO Yingdi. His acting skills are definitely first-class.
As they spoke, they caught up with MO Xiu.
“MO Xiu, since our goal is to become stronger faster, should we start training tomorrow?” Dong Fang asked.”
MO Xiu had never thought about training before. He wanted to complete a mission during these fifteen days of free time. Dong Fang’s sudden question caused him to be at a loss for an answer.
Seeing that MO Xiu didn’t answer, Hao Ren interrupted,””Hey, Brother Dong
Fang, you don’t understand. The most important thing for a new club is to recruit people. MO Xiu, can you organize our recruitment?”
“Who said anything about recruiting new people?” asked MO Xiu. The five of us are enough.”
Moxiu had created the club so that he would not have to participate in the club selection. If he wanted to recruit people, wouldn’t he have to choose again? Only five would be suitable for the competition. There was no need for selection.
“Don’t joke around, Boss. Are you planning to only have five people in our club?” Liu Ziyang asked in surprise.”
Moxiu nodded.” Yes, that’s right. Is there a problem?” The five of them could participate in the individual battle or the team battle.”
He Lingyue looked at the others and said, “Our configuration isn’t very
balanced. Three ottensive, one agility-type, and I’m a semi-support. How can we fight in a team battle?”
“The Black Tortoise Club can fight by force, so why can’t we?””
He Lingyue said, “But we only have five people. We don’t even have a substitute.”
Moxiu nodded and said seriously,””lndeed, five people is a little too little. How about this? I’ll give you a mission, and the four of you will discuss and pull in one person. Remember, it’s only one person.”
The four of them looked at each other. What kind of club did they join? Recruiting only one person?
MO Xiu looked at the time. It was already night.
“Let’s have a simple meal together to celebrate the success of our club.”
The few of them were celebrating while looking miserable. They were simply unlucky.
MO Xiu brought the four of them to the cafeteria. It was really just a simple meal.
Ordinary meals, ordinary conversations, no lofty aspirations, no goals. The elders of the strongest club were born during this peaceful dinner.
9 pm, Dorm 312, Dorm 9.
MO Xiu lay on the bed. He could not believe that university life had begun. In the past, he had worked hard so that his mother could live a better life.
Her mother’s life was already very good now. In the future, she would work hard to protect the person she loved for the rest of her life.
When he thought of this, MO Xiu remembered the girl who yearned for ordinary peace, Mu Qingyi.
MO Xiu took out his phone and sent a message to Mu Qingyi.
“How is it? Is everything going well at school?”
After waiting for a long time, Mu Qingyi replied.
“If you want me to call, please leave a message!”
MO Xiu unknowingly started to laugh. Mu Qingyi was still so mischievous. Oh, no, she seemed to only be mischievous towards him.
MO Xiu made a call.
“Hehe, I knew you missed me. I’m fine here. I’m not as sad as I thought.
Everything is normal.”
“Mm-hm, that’s good.”‘
“How are you? Did you cause any trouble in Beijing?” “Of course not. Don’t you know how obedient I am?”
“Which part?”
The phone call between the two of them lasted for half an hour. MO Xiu told Mu Qingyi about Yan Jing University’s competition education methods and how he had created the strongest club, making Mu Qingyi laugh out loud.
However, after hanging up the phone, MO Xiu still realized that something was not right. Mu Qingyi used to be calm and elegant, but she kept joking around today.
In the past, when the two of them were talking, Mu Qingyi would always be the one talking, while MO Xiu was more of a listener. But today, it was the other way around, and MO Xiu was the one talking. Although Mu Qingyi was talking all the time, she did not talk about herself.
MO Xiu sighed. Mu Qingyi was actually not happy, right?
Moxiu couldn’t fall asleep as he kept thinking about this. He opened the Shadow app to look for a quest.
Beijing was different. There were many more missions than Shun City, and there were all kinds of missions. MO Xiu had to choose for a long time before he found a suitable mission.
“Pursuit Mission: Pursue Wang Jinyang.
[Difficulty Level: B]
[Mission details: Wang Jinyang robbed a bank and escaped with a large amount of cash and precious herbs. Age: 24 years old. Three skills are offensive skills and one skill is stealth. According to reliable sources, this person is still active around Yanjing.]
[Mission Completion Condition: Capture Wang Jinyang and hand him over to the Law Enforcement Team (additional reward for handing over the stolen goods).]
[Mission Reward: 6000 points, 4 million cash.]”
Moxiu felt that this skill wasn’t too bad. Judging from the description, the person he was chasing should be an expert. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to not be caught until now. However, he didn’t know if he could defeat an expert with four skills with his current strength.
MO Xiu felt that it was not safe for him to accept this mission alone. After thinking about it, he still gave this mission to Liu Ziyang.
Liu Ziyang called directly.
“Boss, are you joking? A B-rank hunting mission? Even if we can find him, can we beat him? Other than the investigation mission, the other missions that required the help of the law enforcement team would be rewarded.”
“I have my own way.”
Liu Ziyang complained,” Boss, you’ve already advanced, I still have to compete in the class competition. I compete in the day and carry out missions at night, how tiring is that?’”‘
“Alright then, I won’t bring you along. I’ll go by myself.”
Liu Ziyang immediately changed his words.” Alright, alright, alright. I’m afraid of you. But you have to tell me what your plan is.” Let me learn.”
“Hehe, you’ll know tomorrow..””Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Chapter 48: The Serious Club Has a Mission
Translator: 549690339
The next morning, in the activity room of the Strongest Club.
Moxiu had come early in the morning to apply for a room that was less than thirty square meters. The staff had made it very clear that with the current scale of the Strongest Club, they could only apply for this room.
However, Moxiu didn’t mind. There was no training or selection anyway. There were only five people in total. It was fine as long as there was a place for the meeting.
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren were both going to participate in the class selection, so MO Xiu called for a meeting before class started.
After they arrived, they were all very puzzled. Moxiu’s performance yesterday clearly showed that he wanted to be a hands-off manager. Why did he suddenly wake up after only one night?
“MO Xiu, why did you call us here?” Hao Ren asked. There was no training, no selection, and no recruitment.”
“Sigh, there’s no need for a proper club to do such flashy things,” Moxiu said shamelessly.”
Dong Fang asked seriously,””Then what does a proper club like ours have?”
MO Xiu praised,” Look at Dong Fang. He knows what to ask. We are a proper club. A proper club has missions.””
When Liu Ziyang heard this, he finally understood what MO Xiu wanted to do. So this was the method MO Xiu had mentioned last night? Pulling the entire club into a trap?
Moxiu took out a few pieces of printed mission information and handed them to them.
Liu Ziyang took it and looked at it. As expected, it was the capture mission of An Ying.
When Dong Fang saw the mission, he was a little excited. He had never come into contact with this before.
Hao Ren and He Lingyue both looked at MO Xiu strangely.
‘What’s wrong?” asked MO Xiu. Why are you looking at me like that?” “Boss, you joined the law enforcement team?” Hao Ren asked tentatively.” MO Xiu shook his head.
“Then why did you receive such a mission?” Hao Ren asked again.”
Before MO Xiu could answer, He Lingyue continued, “”This is not the task of the law enforcement team. If the law enforcement team has such information, they will definitely send out a small team to capture them. They will not issue a task to let people escape.”
MO Xiu looked at He Lingyue with interest. He didn’t know He Lingyue very well, but he didn’t expect her to be such a meticulous girl.
“Where do you think the mission came from?” Hao Ren asked He Lingyue.”
He Lingyue pondered for a moment and said, “The information is more well-informed than the law enforcement team, and they can also issue missions. That can only be the shadow.’”‘
MO Xiu couldn’t help but applaud He Lingyue. She had figured out that it was Shadow’s mission based on this little clue.
Other than having a clear mind, she also had a certain understanding of the various departments. MO Xiu was a little curious about He Lingyue’s background.
Liu Ziyang couldn’t help but say,” D * mn, this girl is amazing. Moxiu and I are indeed Shadow.””
MO Xiu didn’t mind Liu Ziyang revealing his identity. Wang Yu had said before in the cosmic tuition class that the Dark Shadow wasn’t a secret organization that needed to be kept a secret.
Previously in Shun City, he didn’t publicly announce that he was Shadow, mainly because he wanted to hide the Universe cram school.
“That’s right, this is our Shadow’s mission. You guys should consider if you want to join us.””
Hao Ren and Dong Fang didn’t really believe Liu Ziyang’s words. He had never heard of it before.
As for He Lingyue, she only said that this was a Dark Shadow mission. She didn’t expect MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang to be Dark Shadow members.
Now that Moxiu had spoken, they were certain that these two were monsters.
“How did you join Shadow?” He Lingyue asked. As far as I know, Shadow’s recruitment requirement is two skills, and only one in ten thousand people are selected. Many of the school’s top talents are not selected.”
MO Xiu directly said,”l can’t tell you how I got selected. Do you guys want to participate in this mission?’”‘
Hao Ren said, ” I’d like to join. After all, it’s Shadow’s mission. I want to see it. But the reward… Do we have a share?”
Dong Fang, who had been in a daze and did not speak, looked at MO Xiu expectantly when he heard about the reward.
“I’ve already given you a reward in the information I gave you just now,” Moxiu said.”lt’s 6000 points and 4 million in cash. Do any of you want to quit?” If not, I’ll talk about the reward distribution.”
Seeing that no one spoke, MO Xiu continued,”This mission is divided into two phases, investigation and arrest. Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang have to attend classes in the morning, so they can’t participate in the investigation completely.” The two of them shook their heads.
“You won’t need the points. I’ll split it with Liu Ziyang. I’ll get 4000 points, Liu Ziyang will get 2000 points, Dong Fang and He Lingyue will each get 1.5 million, and Hao Ren will get 1 million.”
This time, Moxiu didn’t want to be egalitarian. It was better to use a reasonable distribution method.
The few of them were very satisfied with Moxiu’s distribution. After considering it thoroughly, they all nodded and agreed.
Alright,” MO Xiu said.” The first meeting of the Strongest Club is over. Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang, go to class. He Lingyue and Dong Fang, get ready to go with me to investigate.’”‘
MO Xiu suddenly thought of something and stopped Liu Ziyang.”By the way,
Liu Ziyang, Qiang Zi is from your company, right? Can we use it temporarily?”
Liu Ziyang said indifferently,” Of course you can. Qiangzi is my dad’s chauffeur at Yanjing University. I’ve already told him. If you want to go out and find him, you can contact him yourself.”‘
After bidding farewell to Liu Ziyang and the other two, MO Xiu contacted Qiang Zi. Qiang Zi was also from the support system. His skills were not practical and he was eliminated early in the third-year inter-class competition. This was also the reason why Qiang Zi came out to find a part-time job.
Qiang Zi was on call and soon drove to the school gate. MO Xiu and the other two got into the car.
“Boss, where are you going?” Qiang Zi asked as soon as he got on the car.” Moxiu handed the map marked on the mission information to Qiang Zi.
“Have you been to this place before? We found a secluded spot to park the car and walked over.”
Qiang Zi frowned and said,”Boss, you want to go to Fan Street?” What are you going there for?”
“What happened there?” asked MO Xiu. Let’s go carry out the mission.”
Qiang Zi nodded and said,” I’m on a mission. It’s very chaotic there. It’s in Yanjing, but it’s not under Yanjing’s jurisdiction. It’s a chaotic area. There are all kinds of ghosts and monsters there, and there’s often a black market.””
“Have you been there before?” asked MO Xiu. Do you know anything about that place?”
Qiang Zi answered truthfully,” I’ve taken a few business deals. Some bosses wanted to go to the black market there to buy things. For safety reasons, they brought me there. Of course, they had a lot of bodyguards. I’ve been waiting in the car and didn’t go in.”
MO Xiu looked at Dong Fang and He Lingyue, wanting to know what they knew about Fan Street. Dong Fang shook his head, indicating that he didn’t know.
He Lingyue said,” I’ve been to Fan Street once. It’s not as chaotic as I thought. Most people are very law-abiding, but it’s very dangerous if you offend someone there. Murders often happen.’”‘
“Alright, let’s go and take a look first.””
There was one thing that interested Moxiu, and that was the black market. The things in the black market had unknown origins and could have been robbed. If he wanted to sell them, the price would definitely be cheaper.
MO Xiu and the others were dressed somewhat like students, so they had specially bought some clothes from the mall.
After changing their clothes, they went straight to Fan Street….Announcement: we are moving Boxnovel.com to Bronovel.com. Please bookmark Our new Site.

Chapter 49: Fan Street Black Market
Translator: 549690339
Mo Xiu and the other two got out of the car and told Qiang Zi to return to school first. They would contact him if there was anything to prevent him from giving himself away.
The three of them had been carefully styled. Mo Xiu was dressed in an exaggerated manner, looking like a rich kid.
He Lingyue was dressed in branded clothes. She wasn’t very flirtatious, but she exuded an aristocratic aura as she played MO Xiu’s girlfriend.
As for Dong Fang, he didn’t even need to dress up. He wore a black suit and looked like a bodyguard.
When the three of them walked into Fan Street, it was obvious that the two rich second-generation heirs had brought bodyguards here to look for excitement.
Fan Street was indeed a street, and on both sides of the street were two rows of residential buildings.
This location was very special. It was a street with two rows of residential buildings. It was surrounded by mountains and there were no other buildings around.
It was like a lonely tribe. Because it was surrounded by mountains, ordinary vehicles couldn’t enter. MO Xiu also asked Qiang Zi to park the car at a farther place. The three of them had to climb over a mountain to reach this place.
As soon as they entered the street, MO Xiu sat down by the roadside and said,””What the hell is this place? I still have to climb the mountain to come in.
I’m so tired.”
He Lingyue saw MO Xiu sitting on the ground and immediately came over to persuade him,””Aiya, why are you sitting down? It’s already noon. We might not be able to leave today, Let’s find a place to stay first.”
When MO Xiu heard this, he jumped up and grabbed He Lingyue’s shoulder.”Baby, why are you in such a hurry? You’ve only just arrived, and you’re already thinking…”
He Lingyue gently pushed MO Xiu away and said,”Aiya, you’re so bad. Let’s get down to business first.’”‘
When the people around them saw MO Xiu and He Lingyue like this, they were no longer surprised. There were too many people like this.
MO Xiu and the other two walked around and were surprised to find that Fan Street had all kinds of places.
After taking a look, Moxiu almost thought that this was a resort. There was no bad atmosphere here, and every shop owner was trying to attract business.
MO Xiu and the other two entered a small restaurant and were immediately welcomed by a shop assistant.
“What would you like to eat?”
MO Xiu glanced at the shop assistant and said to He Lingyue,”Baby, what do you want to eat?”
He Lingyue looked at the decorations in the shop with disgust.
“Aiya, what can a small shop like this have? Just take a bite.”
“Bring up all your best dishes. Hurry up!” MO Xiu said to the shop assistant.” The shop assistant agreed and went down.
The dishes were served very quickly, but the dishes were very ordinary. They were all vegetarian dishes that they usually ate.
“What’s wrong with you?” Moxiu asked the shop assistant unhappily. Did you not understand what I said just now? I want your best vegetables.”
After the shop assistant served the dishes, she became much more unyielding and said disdainfully,”What’s wrong? Was this boss looking for trouble? This is our best dish!”
MO Xiu slammed the table. Dong Fang immediately stood up and grabbed the shop assistant’s collar.
The shop assistant was caught, but he didn’t panic at all. He shouted, “Someone is causing trouble!”
Seven or eight people appeared out of nowhere in the originally small store and surrounded MO Xiu and the other two.
MO Xiu stood up and shouted at this group of people,””Aiya, are you trying to scam me? Do you know who I am?”
One of the burly men walked over and said, “It doesn’t matter who you are here. Everything in Fan Street is based on strength. Don’t ask for names. Today, you
guys 0Decnent1Y eat your rooa ana pay tne Dill.”
“You…” Moxiu said angrily. You!”
At this moment, He Lingyue said to the burly man,”Misunderstanding, it’s all a misunderstanding. We just wanted to have a simple bite.”
“Alright, don’t forget why we’re here.’”‘
MO Xiu suppressed his anger and sat back down. Dong Fang also let go of the shop assistant and sat down.
The big man smiled and said,”Kid, look at your girl. She’s more sensible than you.””
MO Xiu turned his head around and ignored the burly man.
The burly man said to He Lingyue lecherously,”Beauty, my name is Prisoner. Come and find me when it’s convenient?”
When MO Xiu heard this, he was so angry that he cursed,”F * Ck you, how dare you flirt with my woman?”
The prisoner laughed and left.
MO Xiu was still talking about something at the table, causing the people around him to laugh out loud. Wasn’t this just a lack of ability and only knew how to act cool?
After the meal, MO Xiu went to the front desk to pay the bill. The four vegetarian dishes cost a total of 5000 yuan.
Moxiu’s heart twitched, but he didn’t seem to mind as he threw out the cash.
After paying the bill, MO Xiu left unhappily. He Lingyue stayed behind. He Lingyue found the prisoner and asked, ‘”‘This big brother.”
When the prisoner saw He Lingyue, he chuckled and said,””So what if she’s a beauty? Are you tired of your useless boyfriend and want something exciting?”
He Lingyue said helplessly,” Sigh, if it weren’t for the fact that I had no choice, who would want to follow him? I’m here to ask about some things.”” “What is it?” asked the prisoner.
“We came here to look for some things in the black market. I heard that the things in the black market are more complete than the market, but we didn’t find any black market just now.”
When the prisoner saw that He Lingyue had something to ask of him, he immediately lost interest.
“I can also tell you. You can either exchange it with money or you. In this place, no one will help you. Everything is a transaction.”
“I’ll exchange it with money!” He Lingyue said.
The prisoner stretched out three fingers and said,” I won’t cheat you. Thirty thousand!”
He Lingyue took out 30,000 yuan of cash from her bag and handed it to the prisoner.
The prisoner took the money and weighed it before saying,” The black market starts at midnight every night. It’s on the street. There’s a small market every day and a big market every three days. The big market just ended and there’ll be a big market the night after tomorrow. ”
He Lingyue nodded and said nothing more. She turned around and walked out of the store.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang were waiting at the door. He Lingyue looked at each other when she came out.
“Let’s find a place to rest first,” He Lingyue said.”
Alright,” Moxiu said lazily.” Let’s quickly find a place to stay. I’m exhausted from the journey.””
It was easy to find a place to stay. There was only one hotel on Fan Street. Surprisingly, it was quite large and occupied an entire building. There was a big advertisement outside the hotel: ‘Fan Street’s Safe Haven.’
As it was a residential building, the rooms inside were all ordinary. MO Xiu chose a room with two bedrooms and a living room. He didn’t need to show his ID card or register his name. He just needed money and a deposit. The three of them had just entered the room when Dong Fang said,”We…”
MO Xiu interrupted him halfway.
“What are you standing here for? Don’t disturb our interest, go back to your own room.”
MO Xiu and He Lingyue looked at each other and began to search the room.
“Dong Fang, how’s your room?” MO Xiu asked half an hour later.”
Dong Fang came out and said, “I just found out that you were afraid of being monitored. I looked in that room, but there was nothing. ‘”‘
The three of them sat on the sofa. MO Xiu asked He Lingyue,””How did your inquiries go? Where is the black market?”
He Lingyue told MO Xiu everything the prisoner had told her about the black market.
“MO Xiu, aren’t we here to look for Wang Jinyang?” Dong Fang asked in confusion. Why are you acting?”
MO Xiu explained,” You just need to act as your bodyguard. If we were to look for Wang Jinyang directly, not only would we alert the enemy, but it would also cause dissatisfaction in this place. Did you see what happened at the restaurant just now?” This place was not as peaceful as it seemed..”

He Lingyue continued,” If you want to find Wang Jinyang, the best way is to enter the black market and lure him out, right?””
MO Xiu nodded. Now he felt that He Lingyue was very smart. They hadn’t discussed this before coming, but she had been cooperating very well.
MO Xiu saw that Dong Fang still didn’t quite understand, so he continued to explain.
“Do you remember the information given by the mission? Wang Jinyang robbed the bank and had a lot of cash on him. He also had a Spirit Gathering Grass. This grass is the key. I guess he’s probably preparing to make a move here.”
“How can you be sure that Wang Jinyang hasn’t sold it yet?” Dong Fang asked.”
If it were me, I wouldn’t easily sell a precious herb of unknown origin,” said
MO Xiu.” I would definitely find a fool to raise the price.’”‘
He Lingyue covered her mouth and pointed at MO Xiu.””Moxiu is currently playing the role of this fool.”
Dong Fang suddenly understood and said,” Mm, MO Xiu, you’ve performed the essence. If I were Wang Jinyang, I’d sell it to a fool like you.””
MO Xiu rolled his eyes at Dong Fang. What they needed to do now was to wait until midnight to go out and see the black market.
At this moment, Liu Ziyang sent a message.
“Boss, Hao Ren and I are done with class. Shall we go over and find you now?”
He Lingyue looked closer and said, “There’s no need for them to come, right?” If they come to meet up with us, it might arouse the suspicion of others.”
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren don’t need to join us,” MO Meng said after a pause.” They can act alone. They have their own uses. ‘”‘
“What use is it?” He Lingyue asked.”
“Do you think Wang Jinyang came here for any other purpose other than selling herbs and taking refuge?”
He Lingyue pondered for a moment and shook her head. She couldn’t think of any other possibility.
“Hahaha, women don’t understand…” Moxiu said.
As she spoke, she replied to Liu Ziyang’s message on her phone.
Dong Fang was not listening to the conversation between the two. Instead, he turned on the television and was laughing loudly.
At 11:30 pm, Moxiu and the other two went downstairs. When they reached the hotel counter, Moxiu asked,’”‘Hey, bro, this Fan Street is so awesome. Is there any… That kind of place? A place where you can spend money to play?”
The young man at the counter glanced at He Lingyue and said, “Yes, it’s just in front. It’s easy to find at night.”
“Hehe, thank you, brother.” MO Xiu laughed lewdly.”
He gave the counter man a look that said, “You know what I mean.”
He Lingyue grabbed MO Xiu’s ear and said,””We’re here for serious matters.”
The three of them walked out of the hotel. He Lingyue appeared on the street with MO Xiu by her arm, and Dong Fang followed behind them.
It wasn’t even 12 0’clock yet, but there were already some people preparing to set up their stalls.
MO Xiu carefully observed the people who were setting up stalls. Most of them were locals who lived here, but there were also some who came from outside to sell things.
At the same time, Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang also arrived.
“Brother Liu, what’s our mission?” Hao Ren asked.’
“After my efforts, our mission is very simple.” Liu Ziyang said proudly.”
“What mission?”
Liu Ziyang took out a printed photo of Wang Jinyang and handed it to Hao Ren. “Remember Wang Jinyang’s appearance, the rest is just for fun.”
The two of them didn’t even look at the black market on the street. They went straight to the place that Moxiu had mentioned.
He Lingyue happened to see this scene.
He Lingyue whispered into MO Xiu’s ear,””This is your arrangement? Is this something that women don’t understand?”
Moxiu replied,” A man who stole so much cash and a precious herb to come here instead of running away could only have two goals. One is to sell medicine to earn money, and the other is to spend money for fun.”
He Lingyue said in an inaudible voice,””Despicable!”
As the three of them walked, the entire black market was revealed. Both sides of Fan Street were filled with stalls.
Moxiu walked over to a shop and squatted down to see if there was anything good. However, as he looked around, he saw that it was filled with common herbs and weapons. He asked for the price and found that it was about 30% lower than the market price. It was still a considerable price.
From a rough look, there was nothing important. After chatting with the stall owner, he realized that good things were hard to come by. They either appeared in the market or were occasionally sold in a hurry and had to be taken out.
MO Xiu and the other two walked around and were about to go back to sleep when an item on a stall caught MO Xiu’s attention.
It was a short black scabbard. Moxiu was interested in this because the dagger that Elder Tang had given him previously did not have a scabbard.
The black dagger was extremely sharp, and it was very inconvenient to carry it without a scabbard.
Moxiu crouched down and did not directly ask for the price of the scabbard. Instead, he pointed at a medicinal herb that he did not recognize.
“Boss, what is this?”
When the stall owner saw that MO Xiu was so gullible, he immediately said, “”This is an extremely precious medicinal herb that can strengthen the body.”
“Oh?” MO Xiu’s eyes lit up. Would it improve his body greatly? I’m here to find herbs to improve my physical fitness. As long as the herbs are good, no matter how much it costs, it’s not a problem.”
When the boss saw Moxiu’s idiotic look, he immediately flattered him.
“Needless to say, the energy contained inside is extremely strong. It has reached the spirit level. I’ll give you a cheaper price, 500,000.”
MO Xiu found it funny. Herbs were divided into four levels according to the energy they contained. The Human Level was the more expensive herbs on the market. Most of them were used to strengthen the body.
It was different when one reached the Spirit level. It could have a breakthrough in a certain aspect. For example, the Spirit Ring that could upgrade a skill from Level 1 to Level 2 was a Spirit level herb.
MO Xiu had never even seen Earth Grade or Heaven Grade herbs before. The Spirit Gathering Grass that Wang Jinyang had stolen this time was at the peak of the Spirit Grade, and its effect was to completely improve one’s physical fitness.
As for this lousy herb in the stall, it was still questionable whether it had reached the Human Rank or not.
Although he thought that this boss was really evil, Moxiu looked very tempted on the surface. As he spoke, he was about to take out the money.
He Lingyue stopped him.” We’re not buying it. Boss, aren’t you too ruthless? This thing looks like a weed. Let’s go.”
Seeing that he had been seen through, the boss immediately called out to MO Xiu and the others.
“Hey, hey, hey, don’t go. I have something new here. Do you want to take a look?”
When Moxiu heard that it was something novel, he stood up and squatted down again.
“Boss, what is it? Show me!”
The boss took out something from his pocket. Moxiu took a closer look and saw that it was a pistol.
He Lingyue obviously didn’t expect that there would be firearms in this place.
MO Xiu snatched it over and held it in his hands.
The boss smiled and said,” Be careful. This can be used. Don’t let it go off. Noble children like you love this kind of thing the most.”
“Boss, how much is it?” He Lingyue asked. I think even if this is the black market, this kind of thing can’t be sold openly, right?”
“The lady is right. How about I sell it to you for 100,000 yuan?
MO Xiu took out 100,000 yuan and handed it to the boss.””Deal. I’m not bargaining. You have to give me something.”
The boss pointed at the herbs that Moxiu had just seen and said,’”‘How about this herb as a gift to you?”
Moxiu grabbed the scabbard and said,”l don’t want that stupid grass. I’ll just take anything.
With that, he turned around and left.
The boss shouted from behind, “No, come back. I’ll give you something else…”
Sigh, I’ve lost it, I’ve lost it..”

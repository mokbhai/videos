 Chapter 241: Reappearance of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains  
 He succeeded in transcending the tribulation!
 After a few hours, the torrential rain washed away the filth of the world, making it look brand new.
 Lin Jiufeng also looked brand new.
 “I succeeded. I charged over this obstacle just like that.” Standing in the courtyard of the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng muttered to himself. At the beginning of this lightning tribulation, he fought desperately with the lightning chains, lightning dragons, and lightning beasts to defeat the other party. But in the end, all he could do was to resist their attacks with all his might. The lightning was like a waterfall, crashing down continuously. It was extremely huge, so Lin Jiufeng could only grit his teeth and resist.
 Only now did he survive through it safely.
 The number one immortal in this world!
 Lin Jiufeng deserved this title.
 After successfully transcending the tribulation, he stood in the Cold Palace. He wasn’t excited or trembling. At this moment, his heart was calm. He had finally transcended this obstacle after the past hundred years of hard work and months of accumulation.
 Lin Jiufeng stood in the Cold Palace for a long time.
 The white cat watched from a distance, but she didn’t dare to disturb Lin Jiufeng.
 In the end, Lin Jiufeng let out a clear roar. A terrifying divine sense erupted from between his brows, sweeping out in all directions and spreading.
 Boom!
 This divine sense was extremely huge. It enveloped the imperial capital, allowing Lin Jiufeng to see everyone within its influence.
 Lin Jiufeng saw that Emperor De was reviewing the memorials.
 He saw Bai Tiandi following behind Princess Yulin, handling the matters of the medical school.
 He saw that the people of the Zenith Heaven Path were plotting how to get the war machine back.
 Lin Jiufeng saw…
 Meanwhile, his divine sense continued to expand. Far away from the imperial capital, the divine sense displayed its power and condensed into a human form. It opened its mouth and spat out a celestial river surging with lightning, and its violent aura was like sharp swords. The celestial river let out a sonorous sound that shook the land for 100,000 miles.
 At this moment, the chaotic swords slashed the sky.
 This world was trembling. Countless people felt their hearts palpitate. They looked up at the sky in panic, but they didn’t know what was happening.
 Shuash!
 The sun and moon flashed. Lin Jiufeng’s divine soul retracted and his divine sense retreated. All the phenomena disappeared.
 The common people looked at each other. They didn’t know what had happened, but the throbbing in their hearts just now lingered there for a long time.
 In the Cold Palace.
 Lin Jiufeng’s expression was peaceful and serene. His divine soul returned to his body. He stretched his body and realized that the sky had already turned dark.
 He raised his head and looked at the vast, starry sky. His eyes flickered. Suddenly, he took a deep breath, causing movements in all directions.
 In an instant, thousands of strands of resplendent starlight flowed into Lin Jiufeng’s body like water. These starlights fell from the depths of the galaxy and gathered toward his body. At this moment, the Cold Palace turned into a silver sea that concealed Lin Jiufeng and the little white cat inside.
 Every pore in Lin Jiufeng’s body opened up as he frantically absorbed this vast amount of energy. A resplendent and bright flower condensed on both his glabella and shoulders.
 Opening of the Three Flowers!
 Lin Jiufeng’s body flickered with radiance, becoming extremely powerful and strengthened. At this moment, his Great Dao was perfected.
 Boom!
 Right then, a vibration came from the white cat’s side.
 Lin Jiufeng turned to look at the little white cat. With the help of this huge amount of energy, she also began to make a breakthrough.
 From the Boundless Realm, she broke through to the King Realm.
 The little white cat’s cultivation speed was much faster than before. She only took a few moments to improve from the Boundless Realm to the King Realm.
 Compared to her previous cultivation speed, this was already very fast.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t disturb her. Instead, he instilled all the remaining starlight energy into her body. He didn’t absorb the remaining starlight at all. After all, he didn’t need it.
 Rumble!
 Under Lin Jiufeng’s control, the little white cat’s breakthrough quickly reached the threshold.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 A knocking sound came from the little white cat’s body.
 She was working hard to knock open the threshold of the King Realm.
 To her, this time, it only took a few years to break through to the next realm. It was already very fast.
 She was wrapped in starlight and looked very beautiful. Her pure white fur was currently absorbing the huge amount of starlight.
 The sound of knocking continued.
 Urgent.
 Chaotic.
 When Lin Jiufeng heard these sounds, he frowned. Why was the little white cat so anxious?
 He reached out and gently stroked the little white cat’s body. A gentle energy was injected into her and wandered around her body, smoothing out her anxiousness and the chaos in her body.
 For the white cat, it was like eating an iced watermelon on a hot summer day. Her entire body calmed down.
 “Meow!” The white cat meowed delicately. She knew that Lin Jiufeng was helping her.
 “Follow my lead and charge towards the threshold!” Lin Jiufeng said gently.
 Following Lin Jiufeng’s guidance, the white cat gathered all her strength and charged.
 Boom!
 At this moment, the door to the King Realm was knocked open by the little white cat.
 In the white cat’s body, a vast wasteland was born out of thin air. The energy of the stars surrounding her body all gathered into this wasteland and was absorbed and transformed.
 The white cat had successfully broken through!
 Lin Jiufeng prepared to let go and let the little white cat slowly recover on her own.
 But to his surprise, a roar that shook his divine soul suddenly came from the little white cat’s body.
 This roar was extremely loud as if it had crossed countless years from the primordial era. The tremors that sounded made Lin Jiufeng raise his brows.
 “Why does this sound like the roar of a different animal?” Lin Jiufeng muttered in his heart.
 After this roar ended, the white cat returned to her calm state and quietly absorbed the energy.
 Lin Jiufeng released his grip and watched thoughtfully.
 “That roar just now was like a ferocious tiger.”
 “But the white cat is a cat.”
 “Could it be that she has the bloodline of an Ancient White Tiger in her body?”
 “Then, wouldn’t the little white cat become a real tigress in the future?”
 Lin Jiufeng thought in amusement.
 He wondered if she could transform into human form this time after breaking through to the King Realm.
 Lin Jiufeng was looking forward to it.
 But reality proved that the expectations were all fake. When the little white cat finished absorbing the starlight energy and woke up, she looked at Lin Jiufeng with undisguised adoration and intimacy in her eyes.
 Meow ~
 The little white cat pounced at Lin Jiufeng sweetly and immediately crawled into his arms. She laid on Lin Jiufeng’s chest and licked his palm with her pink tongue.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the little white cat with a smile. Even if she was a tigress, he could accept her too.
 Indeed, being cute was the way to go!
 “You still can’t transform yet?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 The white cat shook her head and said in distress, “I haven’t had the urge to transform yet. Is it possible that I’ll never be able to transform?”
 The white cat was worried that something like this would happen.
 If she forever couldn’t transform, she would always be Lin Jiufeng’s pet.
 She didn’t want to be a pet!
 “It’s okay. If you can’t transform, that means that you have huge potential. You already have greater potential than the so-called Godly Beasts. This is a good thing.” Lin Jiufeng resisted the urge to take out the Form Transformation Pill on him and comforted the little white cat.
 Not to mention whether the Form Transformation Pill would have any effect on her, the side effects themselves were huge. It would destroy her bloodline that originally had infinite potential. Lin Jiufeng wouldn’t do such a thing.
 Even if she transformed, she would just become a cat-eared girl.
 It wasn’t a big deal if she didn’t turn into one.
 Moreover, once the little white cat reached the immortal realm, Lin Jiufeng didn’t believe that she still wouldn’t be able to transform then.
 He could wait!
 The white cat sighed helplessly. “Do I have to wait until I become an immortal before I can transform?”
 “It’s okay. Your cultivation speed is getting faster and faster now. It only took you a bit more than three years to climb from the Boundless Realm to the King Realm. After a few years, you will be able to break through to the Spirit Platform Realm, then enter the Void Returning Realm, and then the False Immortal Realm. It will be very fast,” Lin Jiufeng comforted her.
 “I hope so.” The white cat felt that life as a cat was boring and didn’t want to talk about this matter that made her sad.
 “You’ve transcended the lightning tribulation. How do you feel now?” The white cat asked curiously.
 “Not bad,” Lin Jiufeng replied.
 “Was it very painful when the lightning tribulation struck you?” The white cat asked.
 “Just bear with it for a while, it will pass. A treasured sword can only be produced after countless temperings. It’s the same for humans. Both need to be constantly tempered in order to continue improving and becoming stronger.” Lin Jiufeng rubbed the little white cat gently.
 “Then, you are now at stage one of the False Immortal Realm?” The white cat asked curiously.
 “No, the False Immortal Realm doesn’t have the so-called division of several stages.” Lin Jiufeng shook his head.
 “Then how is it divided?” The white cat was very curious.
 “The division of the False Immortal Realm is very clear. Opening of the Three Flowers, Forming of the Five Energies, Aspect Golden Body, Heaven’s Heart and Will, Wind and Fire Tribulation, Breathing of Immortal Energy, Self Slashing to Comprehend the Dao, Reverse Yin Yang, and Five Decays of the Celestial Being!” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “It’s that detailed?” The white cat was surprised.
 “Yes, I’ve passed my first lightning tribulation. I’m at the Opening of the Three Flowers stage now. Look at the three flowers on my body.” Lin Jiufeng presented the flowers on his glabella and shoulders.
 “What beautiful flowers.” The white cat looked at them enviously.
 The flowers had a milky-white base, but they were also mixed with traces of lightning that swam around the petals, beautiful and dazzling.
 “Work hard and break through as soon as possible. You will have these flowers too in the future.” Lin Jiufeng hugged the little white cat and said softly.
 “Now that you’ve successfully transcended the tribulation, what are your plans?” The white cat asked.
 “Stabilize my realm for a period of time before looking at the subsequent steps.” Lin Jiufeng didn’t give a detailed answer.
 For some reason, he always felt that the current recovery of spiritual energy was far from enough.
 Even several hidden worlds that had been hidden for 15,000 years had appeared.
 This meant that this era far surpassed the previous eras.
 Although he didn’t know why, Lin Jiufeng just felt that he had to continue becoming stronger. Otherwise, he might not be able to handle the events which would become even more explosive in the future.
 “Alright, I’ll go stabilize my realm.” The white cat reluctantly jumped out of Lin Jiufeng’s arms and went to stabilize her realm.
 She still wanted to continue breaking through and transform as soon as possible. She didn’t want to be a pet all the time.
 Lin Jiufeng sat upright in his room and spent the night like that.
 Early in the morning of the next day, Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes. Facing the morning sun, he focused his gaze and frowned slightly.
 “Why do I feel that the sky today is slightly higher than yesterday?” Lin Jiufeng raised his brows.
 Boom!
 Boom!
 Boom!
 Suddenly, the ground shook. Lin Jiufeng watched in surprise.
 The imperial capital was quiet. No tremors occurred there.
 It was the same outside the imperial capital.
 Everything was normal. There was no obvious change in the ground.
 But the tremors in his ears didn’t stop.
 Lin Jiufeng instantly flew high into the sky and looked around.
 In an extremely distant area, there was a mountain range that was famous and had existed for generations. Countless people had heard of it.
 The Kunlun Mountains!
 In the past, the Kunlun Mountains were also very big. There were many treasures in there, and many of them were extraordinary.
 But compared to the other mountains, there wasn’t much of a difference.
 There were more than ten sects of various sizes in the Kunlun Mountains. With the Kunlun Sect as the leader, they taught the Dao there and focused on cultivating the Dao.
 In everyone’s eyes, the major forces of the Kunlun Mountains were very low-key.
 The major sects in the Kunlun Mountains all maintained a low profile and focused on cultivating their own Dao.
 But now, the Kunlun Mountains were trembling. From the original base of the mountain range, a vast area emerged.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at it with a serious expression.
 The newly-emerged vast area was a belt of Primordial Dragon Mountains.
 It was extremely huge and magnificent. It was the king of the mountains and looked like the original Kunlun Mountains.
 In Lin Jiufeng’s eyes, this new Kunlun Mountains was vast and boundless, majestic and terrifying, like a living True Dragon lying dormant.
 This true Kunlun Mountains had endless mountains. At a glance, they were boundless. Each mountain peak was like a dragon bone that merged into the clouds, majestic and magnificent.
 The ancient pines and the vast waterfalls were like a painting that entered Lin Jiufeng’s eyes.
 This was the real Kunlun Land.
 “My feeling is right. The sky is becoming taller and the earth is expanding. The world is recovering to its original state from 15,000 years ago,” Lin Jiufeng said to himself.
 There were signs of this long ago.
 In the Northwest Territory, Lin Jiufeng obtained the key to the Mountain Sea Realm. He opened the hidden world in the Mountain Sea Realm.
 That world had been hidden for 15,000 years.
 That hidden world had never been discovered before.
 Until the previous era, when the members of the Heavenly Dao Sect discovered it and rushed in together. Until now, it was unknown whether they were dead or alive, leaving Miss Hong alone to support the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 Perhaps the forgotten world wanted to appear in the previous era, but it ultimately didn’t manage to. Lin Jiufeng didn’t know if it was because of the people from the Heavenly Dao Sect; he couldn’t say for sure.
 But in this era, Lin Jiufeng clearly remembered that the Penglai Immortal Island that had never been found was discovered by someone who cut apart the sea.
 This was the first point.
 Then, Lin Jiufeng opened the door to the forgotten world of the Mountain Sea Realm.
 This was the second point.
 If it could be said that this forgotten world was opened by Lin Jiufeng on his own accord.
 Miss Hong discovered that in the Hundred Thousand Mountains, another forgotten world had also appeared. It was currently pushing through the world barrier and was about to appear in this world.
 This was the third point.
 Then, it was now. After Lin Jiufeng transcended the tribulation, he discovered that the sky was rising and the earth was expanding.
 The Kunlun Mountains, which had always been praised by various ancient people, finally revealed their true appearance.
 This was the fourth point!
 Combined with these matters, Lin Jiufeng had reason to suspect that everything had been squeezed into this era.
 This era surpassed the previous eras.
 This was a world of great competition.
 With this thought in mind, Lin Jiufeng took a step forward and swiftly headed for the Kunlun Mountains.
 When the Kunlun Mountains shook, Lin Jiufeng heard it. This was because Lin Jiufeng was already an immortal of the mortal realm. Although he was only at the False Immortal Realm, he was still associated with the word ‘immortal’.
 He went there mainly because he wanted to see if the sudden appearance of the ancient Kunlun Mountains was because of his own tribulation.
 Otherwise, how could there be such a coincidence?
 Lin Jiufeng, who was already at the False Immortal Realm, was incredibly fast.
 After a while, he arrived at the Kunlun Mountains.
 The majestic Kunlun Mountains appeared before his eyes. They were vast and majestic. The belt of mountains stretched across the land and suppressed the surrounding land.
 This was a world of difference from the previous Kunlun Mountains.
 This was a primitive wilderness with no end in sight. The original Kunlun Mountains were only a small piece of land here, they were only at the end of the new belt of mountains.
 Standing in front of the new Kunlun Mountains would only make one feel insignificant.
 At this moment, Lin Jiufeng felt as if he was facing the vast starry sky.
 The ground was trembling, and the mountain range was rising. Every mountain here was terrifyingly tall, reaching straight into the clouds. The tops of the mountains were shrouded in the clouds as if they were filled with the aura of the beginning of the world.
 This was the true appearance of the Kunlun Mountains that was recorded in various ancient books!
 Lin Jiufeng felt that if he were to soar into the sky, he would truly be shocked.
 These primitive Kunlun Mountains formed a sleeping dragon. The spines of the countless huge mountains were laid out horizontally, creating a myriad of phenomena.
 This extraordinary terrain created the Kunlun Mountains.
 “The ancient people didn’t deceive me!” Lin Jiufeng said to himself. All sorts of books said that the Kunlun Mountains was the ancestor of the myriad earth veins, the root of the mountains. Its terrain had reached the pinnacle that the world allowed.
 In the past, Lin Jiufeng didn’t understand. The previous Kunlun Mountains weren’t as shocking as the books said.
 Until now.
 The appearance of the real Kunlun Mountains caused all of this, making people tremble in fear.
 [Do you want to Sign-In before the Ancient Kunlun Mountains?]
 Lin Jiufeng agreed without hesitation.
 These real Kunlun Mountains would definitely bring him many treasures that he could sign in for.
 [Sign-In successful. Received Kunlun Divine Stone!]
 “Divine stone?” Lin Jiufeng was surprised. He only managed to sign in for one divine stone in front of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains?
 Lin Jiufeng immediately checked the information on this divine stone.
 There was only one sentence.
 [This is a hard and spell-breaking stone!]
 A stone appeared in Lin Jiufeng’s hand. It was oval in shape and was about the size of his head. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t crush it.
 Lin Jiufeng was already a False Immortal, a False Immortal with extremely terrifying strength.
 But even so, he couldn’t crush this piece of stone. It really proved that the information was right.
 A rock that was hard and can break spells!
 Lin Jiufeng studied it for a while. He didn’t discover anything, so he put it away and stored it in his body.
 He continued to look at these primitive Kunlun Mountains.
 The Kunlun Mountains continued to tremble. Everyone within a hundred thousand miles was alarmed.
 The various major forces in the Kunlun Mountains watched in surprise and horror.
 They were naturally happy with the expansion of the Kunlun Mountains.
 But terrifying creatures had appeared in the Kunlun Mountains too.
 Dong!
 Dong!
 The ground trembled slightly as heavy footsteps came from the distance. A few huge creatures appeared. They were more than a hundred feet tall, and the ground shook a few times with each step.
 There was a huge ape with dense purple hair all over its body. It looked ferocious and carried a terrifying aura. With a slap, it directly shattered a Daoist priest of the Spirit Platform Realm.
 This scene stunned the others.
 In an instant, everyone fled frantically. They were truly terrified.
 This was because behind this giant ape, more than ten of its kind appeared. The tallest one was a thousand feet tall, and its fur was purple and mixed with gold. Its aura was that of the Void Returning Realm.
 Roar!
 This giant ape roared, emitting a sound that shook the sky and reverberated in the Kunlun Mountains.
 “After being sealed for 15,000 years, our Giant Ape Race has finally appeared in this world.” The giant ape looked around excitedly. It took a deep breath and the surging spiritual energy was sucked into its stomach.
 Then, it opened its mouth and spat out a river. It was incomparably resplendent, displaying its extremely terrifying strength.
 The peak of the Void Returning Realm!
 The appearance of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains also brought out the terrifying existence inside.
 Lin Jiufeng could sense that many profound auras were erupting from the Ancient Kunlun Mountains. Waves of auras surged through the air; they were extremely terrifying.
 Lin Jiufeng’s expression became a little solemn.
 He had just resolved the troubles of the Taichu God Dynasty. He thought that he could have some peace and quiet for a while, but who would have thought that the Ancient Kunlun Mountains would appear?
 The major forces that escaped were panicking at this moment. They looked at the huge ape that was like a small mountain, shocked and angry.
 “What exactly is this?”
 “Is there such a terrifying demonic beast in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains?”
 “My sect was actually destroyed by these evil creatures. They are too much!”
 “Why would these things suddenly appear in the Kunlun Mountains?”
 “Is this what the recovery of spiritual energy represents?”
 The group of people murmured non-stop, their hearts trembling.
 For example, the original Kunlun Sect. Their sect was actually completely compressed and crushed when the Ancient Kunlun Mountains appeared. The people of the Kunlun Sect wanted to cry but had no tears.
 “These are the Hundred Races of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains!” Suddenly, an old man said in shock.
 “What Hundred Races?” The others looked at the old man.
 Lin Jiufeng stood at one side and looked over.
 But no one could discover Lin Jiufeng. Even if they walked past him, they still couldn’t detect him.
 The old man trembled and said, “The Patriarch of our Kunlun Sect has recorded that 15,000 years ago, it was this Ancient Kunlun Mountains in front of us that they lived in. There were 100 ancient races living in it that competed with humans and refused to give in to each other. The might of the Hundred Races was so great that other than the top powerhouses of the human race, no one else could resist them. I’ve always thought that this was fake, but from the looks of it, it’s true.”
 “Since the Ancient Kunlun Mountains have appeared, then the Hundred Races will also appear. The world is about to change drastically.” The old man cried out in sorrow. Especially when he saw the buildings that the Kunlun Sect had painstakingly built being burned to ashes. His heart was bleeding.
 The others listened and looked at each other. This was the first time they heard of the so-called Hundred Races of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 The Kunlun Mountains continued to expand. The true Ancient Kunlun Mountains were very gigantic, the current Kunlun Mountains they were seeing didn’t reflect the vastness of the entire Kunlun Mountains at all.
 After the Giant Ape Race displayed their might, they occupied the territory that originally belonged to the Kunlun Sect and didn’t come out.
 The people of the Kunlun Sect were enraged, but they didn’t dare to approach.
 Seeing that they weren’t coming out, Lin Jiufeng was relieved. Otherwise, he would need to stop them.
 Looking at the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, the ancient trees were tall and strong. Many of the old trees had grown for who knew how many years. They towered into the clouds, and sometimes, a few of them would combine together to cover a radius of many miles, even suppressing the tall mountains.
 All these years, such a sight had never appeared before. Now that it had appeared, it shocked the world.
 Lin Jiufeng also discovered that many old vines were like horned dragons that coiled around several mountains. The vines were everywhere, and even the cliffs were covered by them. They were green and strong.
 The plants and vegetation in the Kunlun Mountains were flourishing because they were rooted in the Dragon’s Vein and could be nourished by the earth’s energy. Their life force was exceptionally powerful.
 In some places, multicolored light surged and auspicious colors burst out. 10,000-year-old mountain spirits appeared and transformed. They laughed and played about like children.
 But if someone really treated them as children, the one who would die would definitely be that person.
 Lin Jiufeng went deep into the Ancient Kunlun Mountains alone. No one else dared to enter, only him.
 It wasn’t that dangerous. This place had just appeared, and the Hundred Races hadn’t reacted yet. One by one, they woke up from their slumber and descended into this world.
 In front of a 10,000-foot waterfall, Lin Jiufeng stopped in his tracks. He watched as the waterfall cascaded down like a galaxy, covering half of the cliff in front of him. This wasn’t a flood from the mountains, but a long river of spiritual energy that fell from the cliff. It was a vast expanse of whiteness.
 The might of the Kunlun Mountains and the land of the Divine Vein could be partly seen from this waterfall.
 “The world is becoming more and more confusing.” Lin Jiufeng sighed.
 He stayed for a long time and didn’t discover any violent actions from the Hundred Races of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains. Only then did he leave in peace.
 Of course, it was also possible that the Ancient Kunlun Mountains were still revealing their true appearance. Without a few days, it would be impossible to display its full appearance.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t stay any longer. There were indeed many treasures in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, but the current situation was unclear. It was better not to take the risk. Otherwise, if he angered the Hundred Races, the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty would be the ones to suffer.
 If they could coexist peacefully, Lin Jiufeng was willing to do so. He wouldn’t take anything from the Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 Because no matter what the situation was, as long as Lin Jiufeng signed in quietly, he wouldn’t lack treasures.
 Lin Jiufeng turned around and returned to the imperial capital. Half a day had passed since then. The Ancient Kunlun Mountains had reappeared in the world, and the people of the world should know about it by now.
 ‘Emperor De of the imperial capital should know about this too. Let’s see how he handles it next.’
 But Lin Jiufeng didn’t expect to see Emperor De standing silently in front of the Cold Palace after he returned to the imperial capital.
 When he saw Lin Jiufeng, Emperor De immediately went forward and said respectfully, “Big Grand-Uncle, do you know that the Ancient Kunlun Mountains have reappeared in the world?”
 “I just came back from there,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 Emperor De’s spirit shook. He immediately said, “Then Big Grand-Uncle must know the reason. Why did this world suddenly become like this? The original Kunlun Mountains weren’t enough? Why did the Ancient Kunlun Mountains appear?”
 “You have to get used to this kind of thing. The world is supposed to be huge, but many years ago, many things were hidden. Now, those things are just coming back to this world.” Lin Jiufeng pushed open the door of the Cold Palace and walked to a chair to sit down.
 Emperor De continued to stand and humbly asked, “Then, how should the Yuhua God Dynasty treat the Ancient Kunlun Mountains? Also, is there any danger in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains?”
 Lin Jiufeng advised Emperor De, “Everything in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains is a mystery now. There are hundreds of races inside and all of them are very powerful. Void Returning Realms are everywhere in there. I reckon that there are even some False Immortals. We still don’t know their intentions, so we have to be on guard. Send Bai Tiandi and the others over there to keep guard. No need to panic, but we also have to be on guard.”
 “That’s my plan too. The world has changed too much. It changes every day. Sometimes, I really feel that my strength is lacking. Troubles come one after another, and I have no choice but to come and ask Big Grand-Uncle for help. I’m really a useless emperor.” Emperor De blamed himself.
 “You have to persevere. Millions of people will have to rely on you, their emperor. The world is changing, and the ancient era will reappear in the world. But remember, as long as we don’t change, it doesn’t matter if the world changes,” Lin Jiufeng said solemnly when he saw that Emperor De was a little depressed.
 “We have to stand on our own. No matter what happens in the outside world, you just have to remember that you have to be good to the common people and think for the common people in everything. Manage the Yuhua God Dynasty well. If you really encounter problems that cannot be resolved, there’s still your Big Grand-Uncle to help you,” Lin Jiufeng said in a loud and clear voice.
 “You are the pillar of support for the people of the world, and I am your pillar. I watched you grow up. I’m very satisfied with your grandfather and your father. I’m even more satisfied with you,” Lin Jiufeng said with a smile.
 Emperor De looked at Lin Jiufeng in a daze. Suddenly, tears fell.
 He had worked hard for decades and didn’t dare to slack off at all. He was afraid that he would let down the foundation laid by his father and grandfather, and he was also afraid that he would let down Lin Jiufeng’s support.
 Because of this, Emperor De gave up his dream of cultivating to become an immortal in his youth and focused on being a good Emperor.
 He placed his dream of cultivation on Princess Yulin.
 And all that he had done was to obtain Lin Jiufeng’s recognition.
 No one knew better than Emperor De how important Lin Jiufeng, the hidden ancestor of the Yuhua God Dynasty, was for the Yuhua God Dynasty to reach this stage.
 Being recognized by Lin Jiufeng was something he dreamed of countless times.
 Now, Lin Jiufeng praised him.
 “Big Grand-Uncle, don’t worry. The Yuhua God Dynasty will continue to improve under my hands. Even if I have to sacrifice my life for it, I will not hesitate to do so!” Emperor De said firmly.
 Using his life as the price, he shall continue to support the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 He was the emperor on the surface.
 Lin Jiufeng was the ruler in secret.
 One in the light and one in the dark, they would continue to support this God Dynasty together.

                    



 Chapter 242: The World of Great Competition  
 The sudden appearance of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains caught everyone off guard.
 Even the people of the previous era were very surprised.
 In their era, there were no such things. The Kunlun Mountains had always been low-key, unlike now where it had become the center of attention.
 In just half a day, the news had spread all over the world!
 Everyone asked around.
 Some with high cultivation bases immediately rushed to the Kunlun Mountains to investigate.
 Among them were people from the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Led by the Fire Lord and the other three, they brought Princess Yulin and the war machine to the front of the Kunlun Mountains.
 Looking at the Kunlun Mountains from afar, the former mountain range was no longer there. Replacing it was the Ancient Kunlun Mountains that had expanded countless times.
 The Kunlun Mountains were vast and majestic. They stretched across the land and suppressed the world.
 This was the most suitable description.
 And even now, it was still continuing to expand.
 Under everyone’s gaze, the Ancient Kunlun Mountains became increasingly thick and enormous.
 Inside the mountains were the ancient Hundred Races that had awakened one by one.
 In the depths of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, on a tall peak, a majestic lion’s body was covered in golden light. It stirred the heaven and shook the winds and clouds as it opened its mouth to suck in all the essence energy within a few dozen miles into its mouth.
 The Golden Lion Race!
 Fire Lord pointed out the other lion’s race solemnly.
 “You know this race?” Bai Tiandi asked in surprise.
 “Read more books when you are free. There are records of it in all sorts of ancient books,” Fire Lord said.
 “…” Bai Tiandi was speechless. He was very young and couldn’t compare to someone as old as Fire Lord who had read all sorts of official histories, miscellaneous records, and legends.
 “I’ve read a lot of books, but I’ve never seen such records.” Princess Yulin asked Fire Lord, “Is this Golden Lion Race very powerful?”
 “Extremely powerful. Not only are they powerful, but they also have the bloodline of a divine beast, so they are already very powerful from birth. It’s normal that you didn’t know about them,” Fire Lord answered.
 Just as they were discussing, an old flood dragon flew over. Its entire body was shrouded in flames as if it had just flown out of a volcano. It shook out an earth-shattering heat wave that burned a large area.
 This old flood dragon was different from Demon King Jiao. Its aura was even more terrifying. Moreover, its aura was very deep and carried a terrifying pressure. Its skin was rough and had a very strong smell of sulfur. It burned a large area of the mountain until the mountain was bare. After there was nothing else on the land it had burned, it roared comfortably towards the sky.
 In this area, the terrifying creatures recorded in various historical books could be seen. There were also some that weren’t recorded in books.
 In the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, there were surging fires and crimson clouds soaring in the sky. There was also spiritual energy that was like a waterfall that smashed into the mountain range, creating a huge celestial lake. In the celestial lake, the spiritual energy was surging, as if ten thousand dragons were swimming inside, creating a myriad of phenomena.
 In this celestial lake, there was a long roar that sounded like a dragon’s roar or a tiger’s roar that shook this mountain range.
 Such sights were endless!
 The onlookers fell silent.
 “Even the weakest is at the King Realm. Is this the ancient Hundred Races?” Princess Yulin said bitterly.
 “I saw in a biography that the ancient Hundred Races formed by the unification of countless races are actually not that terrifying. They occupy the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, which is enough for them to develop their races.” Old Man Luo comforted Princess Yulin.
 Right then, a mournful sound reverberated through the world.
 At the original location of the Kunlun Sect, an old ape walked out. It was tall and mighty, and its beast fur was like sparkling snowflakes. In the beginning, it was meditating with its eyes closed. It had been sealed for a very, very long time. Only now did it seem to have become one with the Great Dao and its weak life force slowly recovered.
 In the past, in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, this old ape proudly walked the world. It was a supreme powerhouse that could resist everything. It was quite famous among the Hundred Races.
 But its divine power was no match for the age. It also couldn’t withstand the passage of time. When it became old, it had no choice but to imitate its seniors and seal itself to wait for a new dawn.
 This was a very dangerous matter. It didn’t mean that one would get a chance to awaken in a new era just because one was sealed.
 Many people were sealed, but as time passed, they still couldn’t see the light of a new world. In the end, they could only stay still in the profound ice, unable to escape death in the end.
 That was equivalent to abandoning the last period of time in exchange for an elusive hope.
 The old ape still chose to freeze itself.
 It was relatively lucky. Compared to countless seniors, it had successfully waited until this era.
 Just now, the apes from the Giant Ape Race opened its ice seal. It was only left with one breath of life. It was so thin that it almost looked like skin and bones. It wasn’t as majestic and strong as the other giant apes at all. It looked like an old man in a critical condition, its situation looking very alarming.
 But with this mournful cry, the old ape became fierce. It directly opened its mouth and swallowed the spiritual energy of the world.
 Hahahaha!
 After the old ape swallowed the spiritual energy, it let out a proud laugh. Its shriveled body quickly recovered its luster. Its body became majestic-looking. It then walked out.
 Standing on the peak and stepping on the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, the old ape asked domineeringly, “What era is the current world in?”
 “Which sect is ruling the world?”
 “Whose reputation as a genius is widespread?”
 “Where are the elites of the monster race?”
 “In the current era, where did the many terrifying sects go?”
 The old ape asked several questions at once. Its expression was a little crazed and mocking, like an old urchin or a clown. It let out a cackle that was ear-piercing.
 These questions reverberated throughout the world. Everyone immediately looked at Princess Yulin and the others.
 Who ruled the world today?
 It was undoubtedly the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Hence, everyone looked at Princess Yulin.
 Princess Yulin replied, “Senior, there are many geniuses in this world. Under the recovery of spiritual energy, everyone is a genius.”
 “There are no sects that rule the world, only the Yuhua God Dynasty is ruling this huge world. The 56 prefectures of the nine provinces, including the oversea land and this Ancient Kunlun Mountains, are all the territory of the Yuhua God Dynasty!” Princess Yulin answered firmly. She was neither servile nor overbearing, and she looked valiant.
 Although the old ape’s cultivation base was really higher than her own, she represented the Yuhua God Dynasty, so she wouldn’t be afraid of the old ape.
 “A little girl dares to stand out. It seems that the men have no guts anymore.” The old ape sneered and looked at all the men with a mocking gaze.
 “Old dumbo, this is the princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty. It’s correct for her to stand out and answer. The Yuhua God Dynasty is suppressing the world today. Who do you think you are? Don’t be so impolite. Otherwise, when the army of the Yuhua God Dynasty comes, they will exterminate your race and make you disappear from this world!” Suddenly, an ethereal voice reverberated between heaven and earth. The words that were said were extremely provocative. After saying that, it disappeared.
 Princess Yulin’s face sank. She looked around, her eyes flickering with anger.
 These words were no less than adding oil to the fire, igniting the old ape’s anger.
 It called out angrily. Its huge body flew over. The hand that could be used to grab the moon was very terrifying. It slapped down, wanting to grab Princess Yulin.
 “A princess of the Human God Dynasty actually dares to be so arrogant? Die!” The old ape’s temper was bad. It attacked to kill Princess Yulin.
 In its eyes, the peerlessly beautiful Princess Yulin was even less beautiful than a female ape. Her entire body was white and clean, almost glowing. She had no hair, making her look extremely uncomfortable to him.
 The old ape didn’t understand the Yuhua God Dynasty or the current era, but it knew that if it was in a bad mood, it would have to kill someone.
 Hence, it made its move. This was the first time he witnessed this new era, and he wanted to show off his might.
 In the past, in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, this old ape proudly walked the world. It was a supreme existence that could resist everything. It was quite famous among the Hundred Races too.
 Now that it was in a new era, it couldn’t control its temper.
 The old ape was very powerful. Its decisive move brought with it an earth-shattering killing intent.
 This strike was very terrifying. The old ape’s aura was so domineering that it made people tremble.
 The aura also carried a terrifying killing intent that surged. At this moment, outside the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, the bodies of many cultivators cracked. Their organs were about to be injured, their divine souls were about to be destroyed, and their bones were about to melt.
 They watched in horror. This scene was too terrifying. The old ape’s strength could definitely crush them easily.
 Someone exclaimed, “This old ape is an immortal!”
 But Princess Yulin, who was the first to bear the brunt of the attack, gritted her teeth and resisted with a pale face. Her strength was far from being powerful enough to resist the old ape’s aura and attack, so it was extremely strenuous for her.
 Boom!
 Right then, Bai Tiandi walked in front and blocked the domineering aura for Princess Yulin. His eyes were sharp and his killing intent was like a blade. He gritted his teeth and said, “You actually dare to hurt the princess?”
 In the decades since Bai Tiandi was born, he had never been so angry before. His gaze was piercingly cold, and his blood vessels were clearly visible.
 His killing intent was boundless!
 At this moment, Bai Tiandi attacked decisively.
 He didn’t use that life-perishing fighting method. Instead, he used the fighting method that he had comprehended in the past few years.
 Killing Tribulation!
 He suppressed his aura, arrogance, and confidence.
 He had been a farmer for a few years and had worked diligently. He completely integrated himself into the life of a farmer, slowly learning how to keep the aura that was clearly visible in the past into his body.
 At this moment, the aura erupted, becoming extremely terrifying as it soared into the sky.
 Killing Tribulation. This was a supreme offensive technique. It was a treasure skill, an extremely powerful treasure skill.
 As the saying went, when the heavens sent out killing intent, even the stars would be activated. When the earth sent out killing intent, dragons and snakes would appear. When humans sent out killing intent, the world would be overturned.
 Bai Tiandi was enraged because someone he loved was hurt.
 The terrifying aura that he displayed also made the people around him tremble. They were so shocked that they retreated quickly, not daring to participate in this battle.
 As the killing tribulation came, the winds in the world seemed to bring with them a terrifying killing intent, as if they were all hiding Bai Tiandi’s trump cards.
 The moment Bai Tiandi made his move, the world shook. True Qi swept over like a waterfall, covering the sky and earth. There was endless killing intent hidden inside, it simply had the power to shatter the world!
 The old ape clearly stood very far away, but at this moment, Bai Tiandi gave off a very ethereal feeling. It was as if he had crossed the boundaries of time and space and arrived in front of the old ape in one step. Then, a thick True Qi covered the old ape and pulled it to the other side of the starry sky, isolating it in another world, a world that couldn’t be reached from this world.
 Buzz!
 A ferocious strike covered the sky and the earth. The old ape’s huge hand covered the sky, almost crushing Bai Tiandi into meat paste.
 But Bai Tiandi was completely unafraid. He shuttled through the clouds and pillars of True Qi exploded, shattering the old ape’s palm. He displayed his Killing Tribulation technique in a dazzling manner as it collided intensely with the old ape’s aura in that area.
 At this moment, in the sky above the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, it seemed as if a million troops were fighting. The intense sounds of battle could pierce through gold and crack the stones, creating shockwaves in the sky.
 It was also like a heavenly tsunami. They were fighting in an unknown starry sky, causing the resplendent stars to fall together.
 The man and ape launched a world-shocking battle as soon as they met.
 Rumble!
 The terrifying attacks continuously shook the world.
 The old ape bellowed, “You are a few ranks lower than me, but you want to jump ranks and kill me?”
 “In your dreams!” The old ape’s terrifying aura transformed into a mournful cry as it condensed into an iron rod. It was its pseudo-immortal artifact. With one strike, it split the clouds and the Killing Tribulation of Bai Tiandi. With another strike, it could smash Bai Tiandi’s skull into pieces.
 “No!”
 Princess Yulin looked on in horror. She quickly pulled Fire Lord’s hand. Bai Tiandi must not die.
 However, Fire Lord didn’t move.
 Suddenly, instead of retreating, Bai Tiandi advanced. He directly pulled the old ape along and launched a suicidal attack.
 See Immortality in the Cycle of Reincarnation!
 This was Bai Tiandi’s rogue fighting style. Other than him, only Lin Jiufeng could use this style.
 Boom!
 This time, Bai Tiandi and the old ape exploded together.
 Bang! Bang! Bang!
 The surging energy shockwave spread in all directions, causing everyone’s hearts to turn cold. They were so shocked that they quickly retreated. With this explosion, the shockwave was extremely terrifying. Moreover, there was endless killing intent hidden within. It simply had the might to shatter the world!
 This strike made countless people gasp aloud.
 Because Bai Tiandi and the old ape perished together.
 Princess Yulin was flustered and lost her composure.
 She was so agitated that she wanted to rush out. However, Fire Lord held her back and reached out to control Princess Yulin. He said calmly, “Bai Tiandi will be fine.”
 Princess Yulin watched with tears streaming down her face.
 After the explosion ripples appeared, parts of the old ape’s body directly exploded. Its body was already old, and although its combat power was still at its peak, its body was definitely not strong enough. With this explosion, the old ape immediately fainted.
 The Giant Ape Race was also shocked. The thousand-meter tall giant ape reached out and hugged the dying old ape. He said in shock and sorrow, “Old Chief, you were too impulsive.”
 “I… I didn’t expect… that he would drag me down with him and die together.” The old ape woke up and spat out a large mouthful of blood. Its internal body was no longer under its control. It was like a dying candle flame that flickered a few times and was about to be extinguished.
 “Old Chief, that young man isn’t dead.” Suddenly, a giant ape pointed into the distance and said in disbelief.
 The old ape used its last bit of strength to look over.
 Bai Tiandi, who had self-destructed, returned unscathed at this moment. He had no injuries at all. He looked coldly at the dying old ape.
 “I’m a future Immortal King. From the beginning till now, I’ve always killed enemies of higher realms. So what if you’re at the peak of the Void Returning Realm? I’ll still kill you!” Bai Tiandi said disdainfully.
 Pu!
 The old ape was so angry that it spat out blood. It pointed at Bai Tiandi and widened its eyes in fury. Then, its breathing suddenly stopped and it instantly died.
 Bai Tiandi won this battle unscathed.
 The thousand-feet tall giant ape was unable to restrain its anger. It threw the old ape’s corpse aside and shouted angrily, “I will make you pay with your life!”
 However, at this moment, Fire Lord moved. His eyes were cold and he didn’t hide his aura at all.
 He was at the peak of the ninth level of the Void Returning Realm!
 He was just one step away from stepping into the supreme False Immortal Realm.
 He had also touched the threshold to the False Immortal Realm. With just a little effort, he would be able to make a breakthrough.
 Hence, Fire Lord looked coldly at the thousand-feet tall giant ape. He didn’t say a word, but his aura was completely locked onto the ape.
 The thousand-feet tall giant ape glared at Fire Lord. It was also at the Void Returning Realm. At this moment, it was furious as it shouted, “You want to be the first to stand out?”
 “If you take another step forward, I will slaughter your Giant Ape Race today!” Fire Lord said word by word. His aura and tone, coupled with his firm expression, were not ambiguous at all.
 Why was he addressed as Fire Lord?
 It was because he had a fiery temper.
 When he just came out of the forgotten world, he wanted to compete with Lin Jiufeng. He even wanted to unite the world and become the emperor himself!
 But he was taught a lesson by Lin Jiufeng. Lin Jiufeng beat him until he doubted his life. For the next three years, he learned from Lin Jiufeng how to be down-to-earth and not be too arrogant.
 Only then did he suppress his temper and become like this. He was like a different person from three years ago.
 Such a change also allowed him to reach the threshold of the False Immortal Realm. It was only a matter of time before he broke through.
 Hence, he now had the confidence and strength to say this.
 The thousand-feet tall giant ape was shocked.
 The aura and gaze of Fire Lord were too oppressive. It was really like a wolf. If it dared to take a step forward, this wolf would dare to devour all of its Giant Ape Race.
 Everyone watched in shock.
 This was too domineering.
 With these words, the aggressive thousand-feet tall giant ape didn’t dare to move.
 One step!
 It couldn’t take this step no matter what.
 Fire Lord snorted coldly. He felt disdain in his heart. This ape had grown so tall for nothing and was even more timid than a rat.
 He said to Bai Tiandi, “Come back.”
 Only then did Bai Tiandi fly back.
 Princess Yulin cried in joy. She wiped her tears. Her worry and sadness disappeared at this moment.
 “Are you injured?” Princess Yulin asked.
 When Bai Tiandi, who had just stabilized himself, heard this, his body turned soft and he was about to fall.
 Princess Yulin quickly hugged Bai Tiandi and used her body to support him. She said, “You are very weak now. I will take care of you.”
 Bai Tiandi ‘weakly’ said, “I’m fine, I can stand up on my own.”
 “Cut the crap!” Princess Yulin scolded.
 Bai Tiandi immediately shut up. He didn’t dare to say anything else. He quietly leaned on Princess Yulin and smelled the fragrance on her body. He was intoxicated.
 In this life, he would live and die for Princess Yulin.
 Old Man Luo and King Kaoshan felt too embarrassed to look. They turned their heads to look at the Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 The thousand-feet tall giant ape slipped back quietly. It didn’t dare to compete with Fire Lord in terms of life and death. There were still many giant apes that needed to be taken care of behind it.
 Hence, this head-on collision ended with the Yuhua God Dynasty winning.
 Bai Tiandi and Fire Lord were also widely known.
 Most people looked at them, knowing that they were the top combat power of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 But Fire Lord and the others didn’t care about this. Instead, they looked solemnly into the depths of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 In the depths of that place, a dragon-shaped aura surged. It was accompanied by the intense spiritual energy that had condensed into the form of the divine source stone.
 Deep in the mountains, an ice palace appeared. It appeared in the dark abyss and gradually rose up. Everyone noticed it.
 Bai Tiandi and the others stared and discussed.
 “It was pushed up by the combination of the recovery of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains and the spiritual energy of this era,” Fire Lord said solemnly.
 “It’s an ice palace with an ice coffin inside!” King Kaoshan focused his eyes and looked carefully.
 “There’s someone in that ice coffin!” Old Man Luo exclaimed.
 The spiritual energy of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, combined with the spiritual energy of this era, created a collision. It rushed out of the dark abyss like a tide, bringing with it an ice palace that was floating and sparkling.
 The ice palace wasn’t very big, about the same size as a house. It could barely be called a palace, but its shape was that of a palace.
 It was small and exquisite, a place suitable for women to live in.
 It looked very strange in this huge mountain range. Waves of spiritual energy overflowed from it.
 At this moment, Princess Yulin and Bai Tiandi also saw that there was an ice coffin in the ice palace with a person lying in it.
 A woman!
 This woman’s body was snow-white and almost transparent. A blue dress covered her body, and the other parts of her body were of the same color as the ice palace.
 It was also because of this blue dress that she was discovered.
 It wasn’t just Princess Yulin and the others who discovered this woman. The others also discovered her. All of them widened their eyes in surprise.
 Many of the awakened Hundred Races in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains were frightened upon seeing this ice palace and didn’t dare to vie for it, as if there was something terrifying about it.
 Just like that, this woman laid quietly inside. The blue veil covered her body, and her figure was beautiful. She truly had ice skin and jade bones. Her beautiful black hair was bright and covered most of her face, making it impossible to see her true appearance.
 But without a doubt, this was a peerless beauty.
 Under everyone’s constant gaze, the ice coffin of this woman who seemed dead or sleeping slowly moved and actually left the ice palace.
 As everyone watched without blinking, the ice coffin flew all the way to another uninhabited mountain in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 Right then, with a bang, the ice coffin directly fell down, making a dull sound.
 Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!
 Before everyone could be surprised, countless terrifying dragon roars sounded.
 The area around the mountain suddenly changed. A terrifying place appeared.
 A large amount of dragon energy surged out like a river, turning into nine huge dragons that circled around as if they were alive.
 “Nest of 10,000 Dragons!”
 “This is the top existence among the Hundred Races, the ‘Nest of 10,000 Dragons!'”
 A knowledgeable old man cried out in surprise. He found it unbelievable and terrifying.
 “Nest of 10,000 Dragons?” Princess Yulin looked at it in surprise.
 The others were shocked too.
 After the ice coffin smashed down, it created a loud sound. Then, it actually smashed out a top existence of the Hundred Races.
 Nest of 10,000 Dragons!
 “Is the Nest of 10,000 Dragons very powerful?” Bai Tiandi asked Fire Lord.
 Fire Lord nodded solemnly. “This matter is becoming more and more terrifying. The Nest of 10,000 Dragons once unified the world and established the 10,000 Dragon God Dynasty that lasted for three thousand years. There are countless powerhouses in this dynasty, it’s very terrifying.”
 “15,000 years ago, the last God Dynasty that existed was them,” King Kaoshan murmured.
 This knowledge was what they had read in the forgotten world.
 The forgotten world was hidden 15,000 years ago. It was the same time as the Nest of 10,000 Dragons ruling the world, so it was normal for these books to be left behind.
 “15,000 years have passed. Could it be that the Nest of 10,000 Dragons wants to unite the world now?” Princess Yulin raised her brows.
 “I’m not sure. I think it’s necessary to tell Mr. Lin about this matter. If the Nest of 10,000 Dragons is infuriated, only Mr. Lin can deal with them,” Fire Lord said solemnly.
 “I will inform Big Grand-Uncle. But now, we need to continue watching and collecting information of everything here.” Princess Yulin immediately sent a message to Lin Jiufeng before continuing to watch.
 First was the Giant Ape Race, then the Golden Lion Race, then the Nest of 10,000 Dragons. Mysterious races appeared one after another in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 The Hundred Races that people talked about were slowly appearing. Something shocking would happen every moment.
 And what happened here kept spreading.
 The eyes of the entire world were placed here. Countless people were watching. They were curious about what the first thing the Hundred Races would do when they reappeared in the world.
 Would there be a conflict with the Yuhua God Dynasty?
 Of course, the imperial capital was also constantly paying attention to the situation here.
 Emperor De received a lot of news every day. He was extremely busy.
 For example, moving the common people that were near the Ancient Kunlun Mountains to a few thousand miles away. That way, if war broke out, at least the common people there wouldn’t be displaced.
 Emperor De sent millions of troops to help the people move. This scene was also seen by many cultivators.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty no longer had the time or effort to care about what the people who saw this thought. Like a rescue mission, the troops quickly moved the common people there away. Whole families including the elderly and children all moved together. In other places, another million troops were quickly building new houses and planning the fields so that the common people would have no worries.
 The entire Yuhua God Dynasty was like a sophisticated machine that was operating rapidly.
 Emperor De fulfilled his promise of being a good emperor to humans.
 He also did it in the name of benevolence!
 This really caused a huge change in the perception of many orthodox cultivators towards the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Many people even took the initiative to join in and help the tens of millions of people move. In just a few days, the people were relocated in an orderly manner.
 Imperial Capital, Cold Palace.
 Lin Jiufeng received messages from Princess Yulin every day.
 For example, the awakening of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons, the appearance of the Golden Lion Race, the appearance of a tree spirit, the appearance of the Fox Immortal Race and so on.
 …
 Lin Jiufeng read the information silently and put it aside.
 “Why aren’t you worried? Princess Yulin must be very anxious. She sends several pieces of news every day,” asked the white cat.
 “What’s the use of being worried?” Lin Jiufeng waved his hand.
 “What we need to do now is to move the common people away and deal with the various changes by remaining unchanged. No matter what plans the Hundred Races in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains have, we can react accordingly without harming the common people. Emperor De has done a good job. He has mobilized millions of troops and has already moved most of the common people away. What’s there to be worried about?” Lin Jiufeng said lightly.
 “Aren’t you afraid that the Hundred Races in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains will swarm over and destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty?” The white cat asked.
 “If they do that, I will need to make a trip there and let them know what the King of Hell coming to take their lives means.” Lin Jiufeng smiled slightly. His smile was very, very cold.
 “Why would the Ancient Kunlun Mountains suddenly appear out of nowhere?” The white cat muttered, not paying attention to Lin Jiufeng’s smile.
 “It has something to do with me transcending the tribulation. After I transcended the tribulation, I unlocked the last shackle of this world. The recovery of spiritual energy became even more terrifying, and the Ancient Kunlun Mountains took the opportunity to recover,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “Sigh, these are troubled times. I had wanted to go out with you and walk around the lands,” the white cat said regretfully.
 After wiping out the lords of the Taichu God Dynasty, the world was shocked and fell silent.
 As long as nothing happened, the world would definitely be able to become quiet for a year or so.
 This way, the white cat could ask Lin Jiufeng to bring her out to see the scenery.
 But now, the sudden appearance of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains had ruined all her plans.
 “The appearance of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains this time isn’t an exception, but a beginning. In the later stages, many terrifying existences will appear. This world will become like what is recorded in some ancient books,” Lin Jiufeng murmured.
 “This is a world of great competition!”
 There was something in Lin Jiufeng’s heart that he didn’t say.
 “And in this world, I shall suppress this great era!”

                    



 Chapter 243: Slaying Peacock King  
 Lin Jiufeng presided over the imperial capital and looked at the situation of the world, but he didn’t make any response.
 The appearance of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains was essentially similar to the people who had recovered from the previous era. They had all come to this era to break through the existing order and create an order that belonged to them.
 In the past few decades, Lin Jiufeng had helped the Yuhua God Dynasty suppress the people who had recovered from the previous era. Now, he would also suppress these ancient races that had long been forgotten by the people of this era.
 In this era, the iron law of order was the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 With the Yuhua God Dynasty and Lin Jiufeng around, ordinary people wouldn’t be able to stir up trouble.
 Days passed. Lin Jiufeng spent every day stabilizing his strength that had skyrocketed after he transcended the tribulation, as well as his terrifying divine soul that had reached the Opening of the Three Flowers.
 Previously, in the Northwest Territory, he signed in for a treasure called the Fusang Tree. It was integrated into his divine soul and had always been hidden in it. When necessary, it would protect Lin Jiufeng.
 Under this double protection, Lin Jiufeng was confident in suppressing all evil.
 Lin Jiufeng remained as still as a mountain. The Yuhua God Dynasty also remained as still as a mountain. They watched as the Ancient Kunlun Mountains continued to expand. They only silently moved the surrounding people away.
 The tens of millions of common people surrounding the Ancient Kunlun Mountains were all moved away in seven days.
 Protected by the army, they brought along their families and livestock, moving away from their original homes for thousands of miles. This was to ensure the safety of these common people.
 In these seven days, the Ancient Kunlun Mountains continued to expand, but compared to before, its speed had clearly dropped.
 More and more people surrounded the Ancient Kunlun Mountains. Everyone estimated that in one or two days, the Ancient Kunlun Mountains would completely recover.
 In the past seven days, on the surface, the factions, sects, aristocratic families, rogue cultivators, and the gangs of the martial world had all come here. Everyone wanted to see what kind of battle would erupt on the day that the Ancient Kunlun Mountains completely emerged.
 The target of this battle was definitely the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Because Emperor De had already moved the common people away, there were no common people in the thousands of miles around the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, only cultivators. They gathered in groups and looked at the majestic Ancient Kunlun Mountains in awe.
 Someone asked, “How did such huge Ancient Kunlun Mountains become hidden? And they have been hidden for so many years. This is quite incredible.”
 “That’s right. If I wasn’t lucky enough to come to this era alive, I would also find it hard to believe that there’s actually an existence such as the Ancient Kunlun Mountains in this area. There are even the ancient Hundred Races hidden inside,” said a newly awakened old man with a cultivation base of the Void Returning Realm.
 “A Daoist powerhouse specialized in predicting the Dao predicted a few days ago that this era is a world of great competition. Geniuses are born in large numbers, like the carps crossing the river. In such a great era, the Yuhua God Dynasty still wants to continue suppressing the world. They are completely overestimating their own capabilities.” Someone looked at Princess Yulin and sneered. He was very disdainful and had the mentality of watching a show.
 “The ideals of the Yuhua God Dynasty are too idealistic. They are actually willing to offend us, cultivators, for a group of common people. Now, in order to move these useless common people away, they actually mobilized an army of millions. They are simply stupid.” A fatty sneered.
 “That’s true. The Yuhua God Dynasty wants to treat the common people well, but in the cultivation world, aren’t the common people’s role just cannon fodder?”
 “That’s right, they are just a group of cannon fodder. They are like leeks, there are still a lot of them after harvesting one batch. Even if they are all harvested, after a few years, a lot of them will grow back.”
 “The Yuhua God Dynasty is too naive. They don’t seek to attract cultivators but instead take care of the common people at the bottom. Look at these top sects. Which of these sects will help the Yuhua God Dynasty this time?”
 A group of cultivators who hated the Yuhua God Dynasty were discussing, mocking, and exchanging opinions.
 They hid in a corner, not daring to approach Princess Yulin, afraid that they would be heard. If that happened, they would be in trouble.
 But these words couldn’t escape Princess Yulin’s ears.
 The strength of these people was far inferior to Princess Yulin’s. Although they were far away, they couldn’t sense the spread of their divine souls.
 But Princess Yulin only had a solemn expression. Her delicate little face carried a serious expression, but she didn’t make any move.
 The group of people surrounding Princess Yulin heard these words too.
 Bai Tiandi’s face turned cold. He turned around and wanted to walk over.
 “Stop!” Princess Yulin shouted.
 She looked at Bai Tiandi and asked, “What are you planning to do?”
 “Remove their tongues to punish them for making sarcastic remarks.” Bai Tiandi suppressed his anger. These people dared to speak badly about the Yuhua God Dynasty and Princess Yulin, they were touching his bottom line.
 “Why would a dragon argue with an ant?” Princess Yulin’s eyes softened, but she still stopped Bai Tiandi.
 “Then, we are going to let them continue to mock and ridicule us?” Bai Tiandi asked indignantly.
 “Big Grand-Uncle told me that guarding against the mouths of the people is more important than guarding against the floods of the water. There are many such people in this world. Not only are they not ashamed of being in the dark, but they also want to drag others into the dark with them. There’s no need to pay attention to them. As long as our Yuhua God Dynasty continues to suppress the world and serve the people, there will always be a lot of these arrogant people. Even if you kill this batch, another batch will appear.” Princess Yulin shook her head.
 Such people disliked the Yuhua God Dynasty because they gained no benefits in the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Or perhaps they were dissatisfied with the lack of benefits.
 “Our top priority now is to think about how to solve the problem of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains and deal with the Ancient Kunlun Mountains. The Yuhua God Dynasty will still stand strong after solving this problem, there’s no need for us to make a move against these people. Watching the Yuhua God Dynasty rise by the day and suppress the world, they themselves will die from anger.” Princess Yulin appeased Bai Tiandi’s anger.
 “Princess is right. There are many powerhouses from the Hundred Races in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains now. From what I’ve seen, there are already hundreds of existences at the Void Returning Realm. If these existences really cause trouble, it will be very difficult for us to stop them.” Fire Lord admired Princess Yulin’s behavior, but when it came to the matter of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, his expression was solemn.
 The Void Returning Realm cultivators of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains were different from that of the Taichu God Dynasty.
 Bai Tiandi and the other three easily dealt with the 16 lords of the Taichu God Dynasty. This was because the Void Returning Realm cultivators of the Taichu God Dynasty weren’t strong enough to begin with. Moreover, before they recovered, they had been in a deep sleep all this time. This was unlike the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, where the spiritual energies inside had always been very dense, so there were really many peak Void Returning Realm existences here.
 This gave Fire Lord a lot of pressure. Although he was conceited, it would be seeking death for the few of them to fight against the powerhouses of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 Not to mention that there was definitely a False Immortal in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 Fire Lord was certain about this. It would be abnormal if there were no False Immortals in such a huge Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 “I have a suggestion!” Old Man Luo said.
 “Speak!” Princess Yulin looked at Old Man Luo expectantly.
 “Previously, in the Northwest Territory, the Mountain Sea Realm, the ancient city of the oasis, there were many powerhouses of the Void Returning Realm. They are also very powerful. They have also been warned by Mr. Lin, so they are all traveling the world quietly now.” Old Man Luo reminded Bai Tiandi and the others.
 Fire Lord’s eyes lit up as he said excitedly, “I also know a few peak Void Returning powerhouses. I will try to invite them to help.”
 “I know a few too.” King Kaoshan nodded. This method was good. Their thoughts were limited, so they didn’t think of this previously.
 “I can also invite a few of them.” Bai Tiandi nodded. Although he was a confident and arrogant person and didn’t have many friends, those who he was friends with were all diehard friends.
 “Alright, with you friends, we can build the first defense outside the Ancient Kunlun Mountains and strive to communicate with the Hundred Races inside,” Princess Yulin clapped and said excitedly.
 “I’ll inform them now.” Old Man Luo immediately contacted his friends and pulled them over to help.
 The others also used various secret techniques to inform different people and invite them over.
 Princess Yulin watched in anticipation.
 Now that the common people in this area had moved away, and the Ancient Kunlun Mountains were about to reveal their full appearance, Princess Yulin had a feeling that a huge battle would definitely happen.
 Hence, it was necessary to make preparations in advance in case they were caught off guard.
 Bai Tiandi and the others sent messages to their friends using secret techniques, but very few people replied. Old Man Luo’s expression began to change.
 King Kaoshan frowned and said, “Just now, a few people who used to hang out with me replied that they don’t want to participate in the matter of the Kunlun Mountains.”
 “I also received the replies. They said that the distance is too far and they can’t come over.” Old Man Luo’s expression became unhappy.
 “These people are my good friends from before. But now, they directly rejected me. I have to ask what exactly is the matter,” Old Man Luo said indignantly.
 Those who were close enough for him to send this message for help were definitely his acknowledged friends, but they rejected Old Man Luo without hesitation.
 This was unacceptable to Old Man Luo. In the past, when he helped these people, he didn’t hesitate at all.
 “There’s no need to ask. My friend told me that in the past seven days, the cultivation world has reached a common understanding. This time, no other faction is allowed to interfere with the Heavenly Dao of the Kunlun Mountains,” Fire Lord said with an ugly expression.
 “It’s those forces that hate the Yuhua God Dynasty that is behind this.” Princess Yulin gritted her teeth.
 “This isn’t fully the reason. The intelligence of these people isn’t disabled. They are all smart people and know how to read the situation. Now that the Kunlun Mountains have appeared, the news of the Hundred Races is being spread all over the world. Everyone knows how to protect themselves. They want to let the Yuhua God Dynasty rush ahead and fight with the Hundred Races. No matter who wins or loses, it won’t affect them.” Fire Lord calmed down and analyzed.
 “That’s indeed the case. My two friends are willing to come, but they also told me of this situation. Right now, the Yuhua God Dynasty is going to go up against the Hundred Races. Those people are unwilling to get involved in this trouble. But once we have a life and death battle with the Hundred Races and are weakened, these people will come out to reap the benefits. Their plans are all very well-thought.” Bai Tiandi gritted his teeth. He was angry and resentful, but he was also helpless.
 King Kaoshan said with a solemn expression, “Since the Yuhua God Dynasty has chosen to suppress the world, we must rush in front at this moment. No matter what the others think, whether they come or not, we must guard this place. Thousands of miles away, countless of common people are watching.”
 “I’ve asked more than ten friends, but only two of them are willing to come.” Old Man Luo clicked his tongue and laughed at himself. This feeling wasn’t good. He treated those people as good friends and often took care of them on usual days. When there was trouble, he would definitely help. But now, they changed faces and disregarded their friendship without hesitation.
 Fortunately, two of his good friends agreed to come and help. Otherwise, Old Man Luo’s mentality would have collapsed.
 “I also have two friends who are coming.” Fire Lord nodded.
 “Isn’t it coincidental?” King Kaoshan smiled. “I also have two friends who are coming. They are both powerhouses of the Void Returning Realm and are also rogue cultivators. They have no family or things that they are burdened with, so they agreed without hesitation.”
 Princess Yulin’s spirit was lifted as she said happily, “Not bad. A total of eight Void Returning Realm powerhouses are coming. Together with the five here, we have more than ten Void Returning Realm powerhouses. These are enough to form the first line of defense.”
 Behind the dozen or so Void Returning cultivators were the billions of people of the Yuhua God Dynasty. Fire Lord and the others immediately felt the pressure.
 “Is this the feeling of saving the world?” Old Man Luo chuckled. He was born with a big heart and could actually make a joke at such a moment.
 “I had been domineering, supreme, and a self-proclaimed king all my life. But I didn’t expect that under Mr. Lin’s guidance, I would become the great hero of the people of the world.” King Kaoshan smiled proudly.
 Not only did he not regret it, but he also felt that this was the meaningful thing to do.
 It was better to forget those disgraceful things in the past.
 “That’s right. We still have Mr. Lin behind us. Don’t forget how powerful Mr. Lin is. He’s sitting in the imperial capital now and is our solid support. Once something happens here, I believe that Mr. Lin won’t ignore it,” Bai Tiandi said excitedly. When he thought of Lin Jiufeng, infinite confidence rose in him.
 Similar to him, Fire Lord and the other two were originally very worried. But when they heard Lin Jiufeng’s name, they suddenly felt that this small matter in front of them wasn’t a problem anymore.
 “I’ll send a message to Big Grand-Uncle now and use a secret technique to inform him of the situation here.” Princess Yulin’s worries were gone too. She trusted Lin Jiufeng firmly.
 From the time she met Lin Jiufeng when she was in her teens until now, nothing could stop her mysterious and powerful Big Grand-Uncle.
 This time, Princess Yulin also believed that the Ancient Kunlun Mountains wouldn’t pose a problem for Lin Jiufeng.
 The Ancient Kunlun Mountains had the Hundred Races, but she had her Big Grand-Uncle.
 The imperial capital!
 Cold Palace!
 Lin Jiufeng once again received Princess Yulin’s secret technique message. He received a few pieces of news from her every day. Even though Lin Jiufeng wasn’t there, he knew everything that happened in the Kunlun Mountains.
 Seeing the message from Princess Yulin, Lin Jiufeng revealed an approving expression.
 ‘Not bad. They recruited eight more Void Returning Realm helpers. This is already quite a force. It’s enough for them to set up the frontlines. Now, it will depend on what the plans of the Hundred Races are.’
 ‘Whether they choose to fight and show off the might of the Hundred Races, or to get along peacefully with the Yuhua God Dynasty and mind their own business? The choice now is in the hands of the Hundred Races.’ Lin Jiufeng thought silently.
 ‘I only hope that they won’t force me to make a move,’ Lin Jiufeng muttered to himself.
 …
 Another three days passed.
 The helpers that Bai Tiandi and the others summoned arrived one after another. The eight Void Returning cultivators entered the fray and instantly established a defensive line that belonged to the Yuhua God Dynasty in front of the Kunlun Mountains.
 The people of the other factions were now far away from the front lines because the Kunlun Mountains had completely displayed its entire mountain range. It was extremely huge, and the Hundred Races among them had all awakened. Terrifying auras overlapped and erupted, shaking the sky.
 Other than the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty, the people from the other factions didn’t dare to approach.
 They watched silently from a distance.
 In the vast land, there were only a few people. Facing the majestic Kunlun Mountains, their faces were calm.
 Some were sitting, some were standing, some were resting with their eyes closed, and some were drinking and sleeping.
 These dozen or so people were the account of the Yuhua God Dynasty to the people of the world.
 Although the common people had been evacuated, this piece of land still belonged to the Yuhua God Dynasty. The Yuhua God Dynasty wouldn’t back down.
 Countless people from the various factions watched as they shook their heads and lamented.
 “The Yuhua God Dynasty is strong-blooded and is also very good to the common people. They sent the princess of the current dynasty and the forces that they have accumulated here.”
 “Indeed. These dozen or so Void Returning Realm cultivators are obviously not to be trifled with. With Princess Yulin and the war machine, none of us will have a good outcome against them if our factions face them individually, but…”
 “But it’s a pity that they encountered the Hundred Races. The Hundred Races have been sealed for so many years, how can they get along peacefully with the Yuhua God Dynasty? Among the Hundred Races, even if each race only has one existence at the Void Returning Realm, there are already 100 of them. The Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely suffer a crushing defeat this time and then collapse.”
 “They don’t know how to flow along with the current situation. They can’t see the combat power of the enemy and themselves and are forcefully charging ahead. Although such a God Dynasty is powerful, they are brainless!”
 “In the past, the spirit energy hasn’t recovered to the peak. Our respective ancestors hadn’t all returned yet, so the Yuhua God Dynasty’s strength was enough to suppress the world. But from today onwards, the Yuhua God Dynasty shall be defeated and collapse. It will no longer be able to maintain its previous sharpness and imposing manner.”
 “I have a hunch that the Hundred Races won’t be able to sit still anymore!”
 Countless factions communicated in private and came to a conclusion.
 The Ancient Kunlun Mountains had completely appeared, and the Hundred Races had also awakened. The current Hundred Races wouldn’t get along peacefully with the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The battle was about to begin at any moment!
 At this moment, the majestic Kunlun Mountains stood tall between heaven and earth.
 In front of the Kunlun Mountains, the plains that were thousands of miles wide were empty. The houses of the common people were empty, except for the dozen or so Void Returning cultivators that Princess Yulin brought with her.
 Princess Yulin had been waiting all this time. She wanted to see what the methods of the Hundred Races were.
 She knew that the Hundred Races had already awakened, and she also knew the current situation. They would definitely take action.
 Princess Yulin waited patiently.
 But in the very next moment, her expression turned cold. She unsheathed her sword, and with a clang, a sharp sword light flashed. Blood spurted everywhere as it split the air in the distance. A man’s head flew up and blood flowed.
 This sudden move scared the people watching the battle. They didn’t expect Princess Yulin to be so decisive. In the face of the ferocious and aggressive Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains, she even dared to draw her sword first?
 Even if someone sneaked over, being able to unsheathe their sword to kill this person still required a huge amount of courage in the current situation.
 As for the Void Returning Realm cultivators beside Princess Yulin, they were all very calm. They had long discovered this person.
 This was a Hundred Race powerhouse at the Spirit Platform Realm. His skin and blood were both green in color. It was obvious that he was from a different race.
 Clang!
 A sharp and resplendent waterfall streaked across the sky. Princess Yulin slashed out with her sword again. The sword pierced into the void. With a puff, blood spurted out and killed another person hiding in the void.
 The sword penetrated the other party’s forehead, minced his divine soul, and nailed him to death. Then, the sword picked him out of the void.
 She then smashed the body onto the ground!
 “The people of the Hundred Races only know how to sneak attack?” Princess Yulin asked coldly.
 Boom!
 In the depths of the Kunlun Mountains, a vibrating sound came. Then, a young man walked out of the void. He looked very peaceful, without that violent aura common to the Hundred Races.
 He stepped on the air. Every step he took harmonized with the world, creating an indescribable rhythm.
 This was an absolutely beautiful man. He could make many women in the world jealous and could be considered peerless in beauty.
 His entire body was crystal clear and flickering. Divine radiance flowed around him. There were three eyes between his brows, but they were hidden very well. They transformed into three cloud patterns, adding to his charm. If it wasn’t for his flat chest, one could even suspect that he was a woman disguised as a man.
 This person was shrouded by a five-colored divine halo, making him look like the descendant of a god.
 The breeze blew, and the hair that fluttered seemed to be crystal clear, carrying endless energy.
 He was at the Void Returning Realm.
 The peak of the Void Returning Realm.
 He walked over step by step.
 In the depths of his eyes, there were actually mountains and rivers evolving, and the changes of time. From his eyes, one could see all sorts of deductions and calculations regarding becoming an immortal, making one fall into depravity. This was very shocking.
 Princess Yulin retreated in horror. She couldn’t withstand such pressure and felt a sharp pain in her divine soul.
 Among the Hundred Races, the first terrifying powerhouse to walk out was already this terrifying.
 “You killed two of my servants, I can allow you to become my personal maid to atone for your crimes. Kneel down.” This person was very arrogant and looked down on everyone. He seemed to know that among this group of people, Princess Yulin’s identity was the noblest, so when he opened his mouth, the first thing he said was to allow Princess Yulin to be his maid.
 It was as if this was a great honor for Princess Yulin and she should kneel down and be grateful.
 Princess Yulin’s expression turned extremely cold.
 She was the number one princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty, when had she ever suffered such humiliation?
 She was so angry that she was about to draw her sword.
 But the even angrier Bai Tiandi directly attacked.
 He was furious.
 This first powerhouse from the Hundred Races directly humiliated Princess Yulin and even wanted her to be his maid. This was simply a great humiliation to Bai Tiandi.
 It was equivalent to making him a cuckold.
 How could he endure this?
 He let out a long roar and his hair stood on end in anger. His aura rolled and approached rapidly from afar. He directly smashed down with a punch and executed the Killing Tribulation. It arrived before his voice and carried with it torrential blood energy that directly covered this powerhouse of the Hundred Races.
 The powerhouse of the Hundred Races looked at Bai Tiandi in disdain. He stretched out his hand and waved. A Great Fearless Mudra technique instantly appeared and smashed towards him.
 “A seventh-level Void Returning cultivator dares to behave atrociously in front of me? You’re courting death!” The powerhouse from the Hundred Races was extremely disdainful.
 Boom!
 With this slap, even the void collapsed. The Five-colored Divine Light behind him lit up uniformly. It was very powerful. A huge mudra directly struck Bai Tiandi’s Killing Tribulation.
 Boom!
 This strike directly made Bai Tiandi’s body tremble. He watched in disbelief. His Killing Tribulation was completely useless. Instead, his blood energy surged from the strike, and his face turned red.
 This Great Fearless Mudra was simply terrifying. When it pressed down, the void was like a piece of broken cloth, trembling endlessly.
 “He’s actually not dead?” The powerhouse of the Hundred Races looked over in surprise. He discovered that Bai Tiandi was still quite capable and actually blocked his huge mudra attack.
 Although Bai Tiandi was in a sorry state now, he managed to withstand it.
 But in an instant, the Five-colored Divine Light behind the powerhouse from the Hundred Races trembled and swept down.
 Pu! Pu! Pu!
 The Five-colored Divine Light was like five sharp sword energies. It instantly pierced through Bai Tiandi and then directly swept across, blowing him up.
 With two strikes, this powerhouse killed Bai Tiandi.
 Everyone was dumbfounded.
 After all, Bai Tiandi had killed an old ape at the peak of the Void Returning Realm a few days ago. He wasn’t a weakling.
 But in front of this powerhouse of the Hundred Races, he had no ability to fight back at all.
 “Can’t even withstand a single blow!” The powerhouse of the Hundred Races smiled in disdain.
 But in the very next moment, he looked at the blasted Bai Tiandi in surprise.
 In the exploded blood fog, Bai Tiandi was reborn. He stood unscathed, but his face was filled with horror.
 Wasn’t this too terrifying?
 This wasn’t the Void Returning Realm, this must be a False Immortal Realm, right?
 The powerhouse of the Hundred Races looked at Bai Tiandi. His eyes lit up as he said in surprise, “There’s even such a cultivation technique? Not bad, I like it. Hand it over, and I will take you in as a slave. I will spare your life and let you be my slave for generations to come!”
 “Dream on!” Bai Tiandi gritted his teeth and cursed.
 He only regretted that he had cultivated for too short a time.
 Give him three years, no, a year.
 A year later, he was confident in killing this pretentious prick.
 But now, his disadvantage was that he was too young.
 The powerhouse of the Hundred Races frowned and said expressionlessly, “I spared your life, but you didn’t cherish it. If I search your soul now, I can also obtain this cultivation technique!”
 Boom!
 The powerhouse of the Hundred Races stretched out his hand, wanting to grab Bai Tiandi.
 Under the huge hand, the void was shrouded in chaos energy. It erupted with a terrifying aura that locked onto Bai Tiandi. Bai Tiandi couldn’t escape.
 But at this moment, Fire Lord attacked.
 With a flick of his finger, boiling hot energy erupted and directly rushed over.
 Rumble!
 This strike was truly like a comet crashing into the ground. The light was dazzling and flickered between heaven and earth. It also forced back the powerhouse of the Hundred Races. He frowned at Fire Lord.
 Bai Tiandi took the opportunity to escape back. He gasped and said angrily, “He’s too powerful. He doesn’t look like someone from the Void Returning Realm at all.”
 Fire Lord said calmly, “One of his feet has already stepped out of the Void Returning Realm. It’s normal that you can’t win. Don’t worry, I will take revenge for you!”
 As he said this, Fire Lord’s eyes stared at this powerhouse of the Hundred Races. Flames were burning inside. His entire eyeball turned into flames, and the blazing flames even softened the surrounding space.
 “Who are you? There’s actually a person like you in the current world?” The powerhouse of the Hundred Races rubbed his hand and asked coldly.
 “Before asking for someone else’s name, you have to introduce yourself first. What kind of monster are you?” Fire Lord sneered.
 He wasn’t polite at all.
 Although in the past few years, Fire Lord’s temper had improved because of Lin Jiufeng.
 But that was dependent on who he was facing. Towards ordinary people, his temper was indeed good.
 But against the enemy, Fire Lord’s temper was even more violent than before.
 This was his fiery character.
 “I am Peacock King of the Hundred Race!” This Hundred Race powerhouse looked coldly at Fire Lord and said his name.
 The king of the Peacock Race in the Hundred Races!
 He was very powerful.
 “The Peacock King, is it? When you reach the netherworld, remember to tell the King of Hell that the person who killed you is called Fire Lord!” Fire Lord was relatively domineering. At this moment, not only did his eyes turn into flames, but his entire body was overflowing with flames that were like golden holy light that burned turbulently.
 “You want to kill me? What big words!” Peacock King shouted coldly. He reached out and took out a copper lamp. This was a rare magic treasure, the wick was also burning with flames.
 These flames could crush the sky, they were very powerful.
 “It just so happens that my Peacock Lamp is running out of oil. I’m going to refine you and integrate you into my Peacock Lantern. This is your honor, you should be grateful to me.” Peacock King activated his magic treasure. The burning lamp core suddenly erupted, burning the sky and pressing down.
 Fire Lord looked ahead and directly shook his head. “You want to kill me with just this little flame? It’s simply a joke. Let me tell you now what a real flame looks like.”
 “I’m coming to kill you now!” Fire Lord grabbed the flames on his body and slowly drew out an iron rod that was heavier than a mountain. He struck it out ruthlessly.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 This strike was very terrifying. In an instant, sparks shot in all directions. The collision between the two of them caused a huge commotion.
 They both had one foot in the False Immortal Realm. At this moment, in the air, strands of auspicious energy were destroyed. Auspicious lights collapsed one after another, and the traces of the Great Dao were shattered.
 Peacock King frantically injected his True Qi and magic power into the lamp to support it.
 But Fire Lord’s flames suppressed the Peacock Lamp. Then, it erupted with a powerful shattering light that extinguished the divine fire in the Peacock Lamp.
 “Shatter!” Fire Lord shouted. He leaped and shattered the copper lamp with a terrifying might.
 Crack!
 The Peacock Lamp shattered. Peacock King turned pale with fright as he hurriedly retreated. The Five-colored Divine Light behind him swept out and transformed into a sharp sword that slashed down. It was extremely terrifying.
 At this moment, the void was in chaos. It was cut into countless pieces. The surging chaotic aura erupted, stunning everyone in the surroundings. This battle was simply like one between immortals.
 The Five-colored Divine Light slashed down and struck the flame rod, causing Fire Lord’s face to sink.
 He dodged first and didn’t resist forcefully.
 When the Peacock King saw this, he shouted, “It seems that you are the strongest existence in the Yuhua God Dynasty. Your strength is just average, this world is still too weak. It’s simply a waste to let the Yuhua God Dynasty rule it. You might as well give this world to the Ancient Hundred Races.”
 “The Hundred Races have already disappeared for 15,000 years. After you lot reappeared, you don’t know how to look at the new world humbly. Instead, you’re still so arrogant. You guys are so powerful, but weren’t you guys still hidden from the world in the past? This means that the world doesn’t choose the Hundred Races to rule it.” Fire Lord sneered. He wasn’t afraid of bickering.
 “How dare you humiliate the Hundred Races!” Peacock King was enraged. He erupted and attacked. The sound of the Great Dao was like the sea as an auspicious light danced in the sky. Accompanied by the Five-colored Divine Light, he slashed at Fire Lord’s head.
 Fire Lord shouted, “I’m the same as you guys, why can’t I say it?”
 The forgotten space that he was in had also disappeared for 15,000 years. This time wasn’t any less than the Hundred Races in the Kunlun Mountains, so he felt the same way as Peacock King.
 The difference was that after he came into this world, he encountered Lin Jiufeng. After being ruthlessly beaten down, his temper was tempered.
 But Peacock King was different. He was arrogant and looked down on all the powerhouses in this world.
 Boom!
 Fire Lord struck out with his rod and directly struck one of the colored lights of the Five-colored Divine Light. It burst out with a blood-red light. This colored light of the Five-colored Divine Light couldn’t withstand the pressure and directly exploded. This also caused the center of the Peacock King’s brows to split open.
 His skin split apart. With a violent tremble, he was actually sent flying as he spat out a mouthful of blood.
 “It turns out that your Five-colored Divine Light isn’t cultivated to perfection. Looking at the three eyes on your forehead, you should have only mastered three of them, so there are two of the Five-colored Divine Light that can be easily destroyed.” Fire Lord laughed. He was very clever. Despite his violent character, he was still good at observing the situation and saw the weakness of Peacock King.
 He attacked decisively!
 He easily discovered the weakest light of the remaining four lights.
 Then, he smashed down ruthlessly with the rod.
 “No!!!”
 Peacock King roared in horror. Shattering one light already damaged his foundation. He had no hope of becoming an immortal anymore.
 But Fire Lord naturally wouldn’t listen. He smashed his rod down.
 Crack!
 This light of the Four-colored Divine Light directly shattered. Peacock King spat out another mouthful of blood. His body was on the verge of collapse as he looked at Fire Lord with vicious eyes. He roared mournfully, “You actually dare to break my cultivation foundation?”
 “Not only do I want to destroy your cultivation foundation, but I also want to kill you!” Fire Lord let out a loud roar. He lifted the blazing flame rod and pounced over.
 Peacock King turned pale with fright as he shouted, “Mother, save me!”
 This shout shocked everyone.
 Such a powerful Peacock King actually had a mother?
 Who was his mother?
 Although Fire Lord was surprised, he had already reached this step. Ignoring everything else, he didn’t change his momentum and smashed his long rod down on Peacock King’s head.
 If it struck, Peacock King’s head and divine soul would explode on the spot.
 He would definitely die!
 But at this moment, an extremely terrifying aura erupted from the depths of the Kunlun Mountains. Then, a thick True Qi and magic power transformed into a divine waterfall that directly flew out.
 From high above, it was like a celestial river descending from the sky. It was a vast expanse of whiteness, shrouded in mist and rising smoke.
 If it hit, the divine waterfall would crush Fire Lord to death.
 “A true False Immortal!” Fire Lord’s heart froze. He felt a life and death crisis.
 In the Kunlun Mountains, a true False Immortal made a move.
 And this False Immortal was also Peacock King’s mother.
 Scary!
 But Fire Lord had no other choice now. His eyes were resolute. He decided to exchange one life for another.
 He still didn’t change his attack.
 “Lunatic, you lunatic!” Peacock King cursed in fright. He was seriously injured and couldn’t escape at all.
 Below, Old Man Luo and the others watched in horror.
 “Don’t! A life for a life isn’t worth it!” Old Man Luo shouted.
 “It’s already too late. The best outcome now is to exchange one life for another!” King Kaoshan watched in despair.
 “Damn it, it’s all because I’m too weak that Fire Lord took the risk to fight.” Bai Tiandi blamed himself angrily.
 The others looked at the void, at the swirling chaos, the falling divine waterfall, the flaming rod, and Fire Lord’s resolute back. They were all speechless.
 No one expected that the first battle would be so intense and tragic.
 Everyone thought that Fire Lord would be swapping his life for Peacock King’s.
 In fact, he might not even be able to make the swap.
 The imperial capital!
 Cold Palace!
 Lin Jiufeng drank his tea slowly.
 He had long noticed the battle outside the Kunlun Mountains.
 He thought that Fire Lord would win without any problem. Peacock King wouldn’t pose a threat.
 But the situation suddenly changed drastically. Fire Lord was in grave danger now.
 Lin Jiufeng snorted coldly. “Killing the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty in the territory of the Yuhua God Dynasty, you think that I don’t exist?”
 He directly threw the cup in his hand out.
 Boom!
 The black cup carried the tea directly to the Kunlun Mountains.
 Then, with a bang, the black cup transformed into an extremely huge black mountain. It was majestic and oppressive, like the king of the mountains and the emperor of the mountains. It carried a terrifying and oppressive aura.
 It suppressed down.
 As for the water in the cup, it transformed into a vast sea. The boundless sea covered the area and immediately cut off the divine waterfall. Along with the huge black mountain, the surging sea smashed into the Kunlun Mountains, causing the woman who attacked to let out a tragic cry.
 Pu!
 At the same time, Fire Lord’s rod also smashed down.
 It struck Peacock King’s head.
 Peacock King’s head exploded, the same was true for his divine soul.
 He died on the spot!
 A King with a promising future in the Kunlun Mountains was thus wiped out.
 AHHHH!
 In the Kunlun Mountains, the mournful cry of a woman came. She was in great pain.
 Her son was killed, and she could not save him.

                    



 Chapter 244: Painting of the People  
 Not only did Peacock King’s mother not save him, but she also lost her life.
 In the depths of the Kunlun Mountains, there was a mountain where immortal stamens were blooming. On this mountain lived the Empress of the Peacock Race. She was the actual ruler of the Peacock Race and also the mother of Peacock King.
 She was at the False Immortal Realm!
 She herself was very powerful. When the Kunlun Mountains recovered, she also started to recover.
 But the False Immortal Realm couldn’t compare to the Void Returning Realm after all. She needed more time to recover to her peak. Peacock King was conceited and arrogant. He believed that with the Five-colored Divine Light in his hand, he could suppress all the enemies in the world. Moreover, the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty weren’t powerful either. He could completely display the might of the Peacock Race of the Hundred Races in this situation.
 Therefore, he confidently went out.
 Then, he was defeated by Fire Lord and killed.
 Mother Peacock didn’t expect this at all. The first thing she did after recovering was to save Peacock King.
 But the black mountain and the surging sea that appeared out of thin air directly smashed down, causing Mother Peacock’s body to tremble violently. Her blood energy surged. Her Five-colored Divine Light that was even stronger than Peacock King’s frantically swept up, but it was still useless.
 Boom!
 The mountain range she was in was directly smashed into pieces by the black mountain that Lin Jiufeng threw out. It was as if the sky had collapsed, shattering everything in the surroundings and burying Mother Peacock beneath.
 Pu!
 Mother Peacock was so angry that she spat out blood. Her Five-colored Divine Light could negate Lin Jiufeng’s attack on her, but the surrounding mountains couldn’t. Moreover, it was already very strenuous for her to negate Lin Jiufeng’s attack. She couldn’t withstand the crashing of the surrounding mountains at all.
 Boom!
 Mother Peacock erupted with a thick aura and directly split the rubble that was pressing down on her body. She was quite angry as she shouted angrily, “Who’s hiding in the dark?”
 This angry roar reverberated throughout the Kunlun Mountains. Everyone from the Hundred Races was surprised. Who had angered this proud Mother Peacock and even made her suffer?
 After Mother Peacock shouted angrily, her eyes narrowed. Her beautiful pupils shrank violently, and she was in shock.
 She saw the cup that Lin Jiufeng threw out.
 A black cup!
 The overall shape was exactly the same as the huge black mountain from before.
 “Impossible!” Mother Peacock cried out in horror.
 This was too terrifying.
 An ordinary black cup was thrown out and transformed into a huge black mountain that beat her up.
 Just how powerful was this person who threw the cup?
 After being shocked, tears fell from Mother Peacock’s eyes. She saw the corpse of Peacock King, her favorite son, her most talented son, and the future hope of the Peacock Race.
 But now, he was lying coldly outside the Kunlun Mountains with an incomplete corpse. Her heart ached so much that her aura became chaotic. It exploded into extremely terrifying storms that swept through heaven and earth.
 “Yuhua God Dynasty, you all deserve to die!!!” Mother Peacock’s true body let out a blood-curdling roar that shook the sky. That terrifying aura surged wave after wave in the sky, making the wind and clouds avoid it, making the blue sky tremble. The aura of a False Immortal was clearly displayed.
 At this moment, everyone in the world knew that there was a False Immortal in the Kunlun Mountains.
 But what scared them even more was…
 The Yuhua God Dynasty also had a False Immortal!
 This was the most terrifying thing.
 It turned out that Bai Tiandi and Fire Lord weren’t the trump cards of the Yuhua God Dynasty. Their true trump card had already reached the False Immortal Realm.
 When Fire Lord killed Peacock King just now, everyone had seen the black mountain that appeared out of thin air and smashed into the Kunlun Mountains with a vast sea.
 If it weren’t for that attack, the one who would have died would have been Fire Lord.
 Moreover, after the blood-curdling roar of Mother Peacock, the Kunlun Mountains actually fell silent. Mother Peacock actually didn’t come charging out angrily.
 She actually endured the pain of losing her son and didn’t erupt her power to kill Fire Lord.
 There was only one answer!
 Mother Peacock was afraid of that False Immortal of the Yuhua God Dynasty!
 From that strike just now, Mother Peacock suffered a disadvantage. That was why she could only shout angrily and didn’t dare to make a move.
 After some analysis, the people from the countless surrounding factions gasped. They were shocked.
 Wasn’t the Yuhua God Dynasty too terrifying?
 Not to mention that there were so many people in the Void Returning Realm, but there was also a False Immortal?
 At this moment, people from the various large factions were discussing fervently.
 “In this era, the Yuhua God Dynasty actually has a False Immortal. Our ancestors haven’t even recovered yet.”
 “Exactly. Some time ago, I went to ask my old ancestor to come out. But my old ancestor said that the spiritual energy in the world today isn’t abundant enough to allow a False Immortal to roam freely. He needs to wait a little longer. Otherwise, even if he comes out, he will have to suppress his cultivation realm. But he’s afraid that by that time, the Yuhua God Dynasty will already have a False Immortal,” said a sect master-level person.
 “Who is this False Immortal?” Someone asked in puzzlement.
 “That’s right. My ancestor also said that it isn’t easy for a False Immortal to exist in the current world. The world doesn’t allow someone so powerful to appear yet. At the very least, we have to wait another year or two before a False Immortal can appear. How can there be a False Immortal in the Yuhua God Dynasty?” Some people found it unbelievable.
 “Have you guys forgotten that all along, the Yuhua God Dynasty has a legend of an ancestor? Every time the Yuhua God Dynasty encounters a major crisis, a mysterious person will stand out and solve the problem.” The Zenith Heaven Path Sect Master hidden amongst this group of people revealed.
 Because the Zenith Heaven Path was close to the imperial capital, its members often worked for Emperor De. Although they were very unwilling, they couldn’t refuse. The current Yuhua God Dynasty was no longer the Yuhua God Dynasty when the Zenith Heaven Path had just appeared.
 The Zenith Heaven Path could only compromise. They had no choice but to handle the matters ordered by Emperor De.
 This also caused them to know many secrets of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 At the very least, they knew more than the people who made wild guesses outside.
 They vaguely knew about Lin Jiufeng’s existence.
 This time, they naturally came too. They thought that they could use the Hundred Races in the Kunlun Mountains to attack the Yuhua God Dynasty so that they could take the opportunity to take back the war machine and escape the influence of the Yuhua God Dynasty and welcome the glory that belonged to them.
 But reality struck them hard.
 Lin Jiufeng’s move further convinced them that there was a False Immortal in the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The Sect Leader of the Zenith Heaven Path sighed helplessly in his heart.
 But his mentality adjusted very quickly. Perhaps it was because he had experienced too much. Every time he saw hope and was about to make a move, the Yuhua God Dynasty would extinguish it. The disappointment that came each time stacked together. After experiencing so much, his mentality was tempered.
 But his words puzzled the others.
 “That ancestor of the Yuhua God Dynasty isn’t someone who has awakened from the previous era, is he?” A sect master from a demonic sect raised a question.
 “That’s right. All these years, we have also been secretly investigating. That old ancestor of the Yuhua God Dynasty appeared at the beginning of the recovery of spiritual energy. At that time, he suppressed the Buddhist Sects in Jiangnan and was already one step ahead of everyone in terms of cultivation. Until now, if the person who attacked just now was him, then in these 100 years, this person actually cultivated to the False Immortal Realm,” an old man said in shock.
 His words made the others fall silent.
 Each of them calculated the time, and instantly, it was as if a pot of water had been poured into a pot of oil. They erupted.
 “In 100 years, he cultivated from the Human God Realm to the False Immortal Realm?”
 “This is too absurd!”
 “This is impossible. Doesn’t that mean that us people who have recovered from past eras aren’t cultivating as fast as him?”
 “Our ancestor can’t even recover now, but he’s already at the False Immortal Realm?”
 Momentarily, everyone raised their doubts. This was too exaggerated.
 No one was willing to believe this. If this was true, then what were they, people who had cultivated for thousands of years, considered?
 “Perhaps, this is true!” But at this moment, an old man in a Daoist robe said leisurely.
 “Old Daoist Red Dragon, do you know what you are talking about?” A sect master snorted coldly. “False Immortal Realms aren’t allowed in the current world. They appeared in the Kunlun Mountains because the Kunlun Mountains have always been hidden from this world. The spiritual energy in the Ancient Kunlun Mountains had never weakened, that’s why they can break through to the False Immortal Realm. But in the outside world, this is impossible.”
 “That’s right. If this world allows False Immortals to be born now, then the few False Immortals of our Quan Zhen Sect can already recover and come out.” Another sect master nodded. It was the Quan Zhen Sect that had always called itself the leader of the Daoist sects.
 The others looked at the old Daoist priest, expressing their doubts.
 But Old Daoist Red Dragon said calmly, “All of you are right, but you neglected one thing. That is, in every era, among the common people, there will be a genius with a powerful destiny who will lead the world and establish himself in the world, becoming an existence that everyone looks up to.”
 “When you encounter such a person, you will doubt your life and think that you are useless. Why did the heavens create such a person?”
 “They all have the same title!”
 “Son of the Era!”
 “You can also call them the Son of Destiny!”
 “Other people are unable to break through to the False Immortal Realm, other people are unable to cultivate from the beginning to breaking through to the False Immortal Realm in a hundred years. Other people are unable to guide the recovery of the spiritual energy…”
 “But this person can!”
 Old Daoist Red Dragon spoke one sentence after another, enlightening everyone, making everyone gulp.
 “The Son of Destiny!” Everyone murmured, not believing it at all.
 “Bullsh*t Son of Destiny. Even if he broke through to the False Immortal Realm, so what? In this situation, the Kunlun Mountains and the Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely fight to the death. There’s more than one False Immortal in the Kunlun Mountains. There are hundreds of races inside. Not to mention too many, but there are at least about a dozen False Immortals, right? What does the Yuhua God Dynasty have?” A Demon Path Sect Master shouted coldly, using extremely contemptuous words to cover the fear in his heart.
 “Even if the Yuhua God Dynasty has this Son of Destiny, it will still perish!”
 “This world will soon become chaotic and become a cultivation feast.”
 “How can there be an era of spiritual energy recovery but the cultivators are being suppressed by a God Dynasty? Ridiculous!”
 The Demon Path Sect Master was very angry. Their demonic sects had planned to bring disaster to the world several times, but they were all suppressed by the Yuhua God Dynasty. The common people lived and worked in peace, and the cultivators also didn’t dare to be impudent. Anyone who dared to provoke the Yuhua God Dynasty had been wiped out. Was this still the golden age for cultivators?
 The Yuhua God Dynasty was the malignant tumor of this world. It had to be wiped out.
 “That’s right. This world is the world of cultivators. There’s no need for order. The strong will always be strong, and the weak must work hard to become stronger. This is the essence of the world. The weak are prey to the strong. The Yuhua God Dynasty actually wants us to be on equal footing with the common people? That’s simply a dream!”
 “I’m just waiting to see how the Yuhua God Dynasty will be wiped out by the Hundred Races in the Kunlun Mountains. When the time comes, I will step on the Yuhua God Dynasty’s tombstone.”
 “Those who stand in the way of the era will definitely be abandoned by the era!”
 The leaders of the various sects spoke one after another. It was obvious that they had been suppressed into quite a terrible state by the Yuhua God Dynasty in the past few years. There were too many rules and regulations. Cultivators couldn’t live a carefree life. They couldn’t kill people just because they wanted to. They couldn’t rule over a region and obtain the worship of the common people and countless resources. In this case, what was the point of cultivating?
 Old Daoist Red Dragon looked at them. His eyes sank and he didn’t want to speak anymore. These people couldn’t stand the Yuhua God Dynasty, but he admired it.
 But admiration was admiration.
 Old Daoist Red Dragon also thought that the Yuhua God Dynasty wouldn’t be able to overcome the problem of the Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains.
 Therefore, if the Yuhua God Dynasty lost, it would only be a short spark of light in the river of time. No matter how good their ideals were, no matter how outstanding their executions were, it would still be difficult for them to compete with top powerhouses.
 Hence, he watched silently. Not slandering the Yuhua God Dynasty was his final respect for it.
 …
 The cold wind swept across the land, wailing in the mountains and ravines, making it seem even more desolate.
 The Ancient Kunlun Mountains were vast and boundless. In the huge lush trees, loneliness and dullness was the eternal theme. In some places, it was difficult to see hundreds of different types of flowers blooming, and it was also rare to see the fragrance of flowers and the birds singing.
 At night, the galaxy in the sky was like a curtain that covered the world. There were stars scattered like sesame seeds on it. It looked like a great artist painting a great painting with his talent.
 And on the ground, a purple mountain stood horizontally in front, charging into the sky like a furious sword. This was the Kunlun Mountains, there were black mountain peaks and mountain ranges.
 Looking from Princess Yulin’s side, the starlight of the night scattered down. Nine mountains were laid out horizontally on the horizon, like nine true dragons lying horizontally, emitting an ancient and lonely aura.
 Just a corner of the Kunlun Mountains was already this terrifying.
 In the battle earlier, Peacock King was killed by Fire Lord, but Fire Lord was also injured.
 He wasn’t injured by Peacock King, but by Mother Peacock’s aura.
 “I am at the peak of the Void Returning Realm. Even though I have one foot in the False Immortal Realm, the gap between me and a true False Immortal is still huge,” Fire Lord said with emotion.
 “At least you killed Peacock King!” Princess Yulin comforted.
 “No, if Mr. Lin didn’t act in the end, I would have died too. I might not have been able to kill him.” Fire Lord shook his head.
 “That’s enough, you’re already so powerful. Look at me. I was even hung up and beaten by Peacock King. This is the third time in my life that I’ve been defeated.” Bai Tiandi self-mocked.
 “You are still young. You have the greatest potential here. Even Mr. Lin praised you and said that your future is definitely limitless. Didn’t you always say that you want to be the king among the immortals?” Old Man Luo said with a smile.
 “I’m down-to-earth now. These things are still okay to think about, but we have to take them one step at a time. What we have to do now is to defend against the Kunlun Mountains,” Bai Tiandi pointed with his finger and said firmly.
 “In today’s battle, we also showed the Kunlun Mountains that the Yuhua God Dynasty is not to be trifled with. With you guys around, there’s no need to be afraid of the Void Returning Realm cultivators. As for the False Immortals, Big Grand-Uncle will handle them, so the Kunlun Mountains aren’t that terrifying,” Princess Yulin encouraged.
 “But what do you guys think the Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains will do after this battle?” King Kaoshan asked.
 “I don’t know about the others, but Peacock King’s mother, that False Immortal, really hates me to death.” Fire Lord laughed, not worried at all.
 Instead, he felt that being hated to the core by a False Immortal was something to be proud of.
 As long as he was given some time, he wouldn’t be afraid of a False Immortal Realm powerhouse anymore.
 In the battle earlier, he was indeed in a lot of danger, but there were also huge opportunities in great danger. Fire Lord had quite a deep realization. He witnessed the power of a true False Immortal and felt the gap. Only then did he understand the difference between him and a False Immortal.
 This was a very rare experience that could help him grow.
 “I think…” Princess Yulin was just about to raise her thoughts when she saw a beautiful woman dressed in a golden feather dress fly out of the silent Kunlun Mountains. She had an exotic but beautiful face.
 Shuash!
 This woman instantly arrived in front of everyone.
 The dozen or so Void Returning Realm cultivators behind Princess Yulin stood up at once, protecting her in the middle.
 Fire Lord watched attentively with a solemn gaze.
 As for the sect leaders of the various large factions that were constantly paying attention to this place, they were all paying close attention to this place. Could it be that a huge battle was about to break out?
 This woman in the golden feathered dress arrived 300 meters in front of Princess Yulin and stopped. Her face was proud, but she wasn’t as proud as Peacock King. She looked at Princess Yulin and asked, “Are you in charge of this place?”
 Princess Yulin wasn’t inferior either. Although her cultivation base was inferior, she represented the Yuhua God Dynasty, so she wasn’t afraid.
 “I am Princess Yulin. Who are you?” Princess Yulin raised her chin. She was valiant and her aura wasn’t inferior to the other party at all.
 “Nest of 10,000 Dragons, Huang Xian’er!” The woman in the golden feathered dress introduced herself. Her calm words made the surrounding people gasp.
 There were hundreds of races in the Kunlun Mountains. Some were weak, some were strong. An example of the weak ones was the Great Ape Race. This race was threatened by Fire Lord and didn’t dare to advance.
 But powerful races were really powerful.
 The Nest of 10,000 Dragons was a very powerful race among the Hundred Races.
 Previously, everyone had witnessed the coffin of that woman in the Nest of 10,000 Dragons and remembered this top race.
 Now, the woman from the Nest of 10,000 Dragons had appeared before their eyes. Why had she come here?
 “An existence of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons, why have you come to look for me?” Princess Yulin asked.
 “Your Yuhua Sacred Land has a False Immortal. He’s the only one in the current era. He’s already qualified to negotiate conditions with our Nest of 10,000 Dragons.” Huang Xian’er said with a sense of innate nobility and the pride of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons.
 “Negotiate conditions?” Princess Yulin raised her brows. Huang Xian’er’s tone wasn’t good, as if she was giving the Yuhua God Dynasty a lot of benefits and honor by negotiating conditions with the Nest of 10,000 Dragons.
 “What do you want to negotiate about?” Princess Yulin suppressed the discomfort in her heart and asked.
 “The world ruled by the Yuhua God Dynasty was once ruled by the Nest of 10,000 Dragons.” Huang Xian’er didn’t state the conditions. Instead, she looked around and said with emotion.
 “If you were to return to 15,000 years ago, then this would be the 10,000 Dragon God Dynasty of your Nest of 10,000 Dragons. But it’s a pity that time has washed away all the splendor and beautiful buildings. The dust of history has long wiped out these things. It’s better to talk about some realistic problems.” Princess Yulin countered bluntly. She wouldn’t admit that this was the territory of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons.
 The Taichu God Dynasty wanted to re-establish itself, but it was wiped out by them. The Taichu God Dynasty was from just thousands of years ago, and they weren’t acknowledged by the Yuhua God Dynasty. If the Nest of 10,000 Dragons from 15,000 ago had such thoughts, it was better to dismiss them as soon as possible.
 Huang Xian’er was a woman. All women had the heart to compete with their beauty. She was very beautiful, but Princess Yulin wasn’t inferior at all. She was from a noble background and had the noble aura that she had developed since she was young, but Princess Yulin wasn’t bad either. As the number one princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty, an amazing woman praised by the people of the world, her thinking was outstanding. The two women looked at each other at this moment and saw the displeasure in each other’s eyes.
 “It seems that the Yuhua God Dynasty has some capabilities. They nurtured such an outstanding woman like you in this stale world.” Huang Xian’er’s cultivation level was higher than Princess Yulin’s, but she had cultivated for more time than Princess Yulin. She was already more than a hundred years old, so she naturally could see that Princess Yulin had only cultivated for decades. Therefore, although she didn’t like Princess Yulin, it didn’t stop her from praising her.
 The others watched as the two women spoke, not saying a word.
 Now that Huang Xian’er praised Princess Yulin, according to the usual practice, Princess Yulin should praise her too.
 But Princess Yulin said, “I naturally know that I’m very outstanding. This is a publicly accepted fact. There’s no need for you to go into detail. Instead, you should directly tell me your motive. What does the Nest of 10,000 Dragons want to discuss with the Yuhua God Dynasty?”
 Huang Xian’er looked at Princess Yulin speechlessly. In terms of skin thickness, she had lost.
 Taking a deep breath, Huang Xian’er cleared her mind of these messy thoughts. She said in a deep voice, “I represent the Nest of 10,000 Dragons and the Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains to discuss with your Yuhua God Dynasty. This time, the Hundred Races of our Kunlun Mountains have reappeared in this world, but we don’t want to create a huge massacre. Your Yuhua God Dynasty must give up the land within a million miles of the Kunlun Mountains. The Hundred Races of our Kunlun Mountains guarantee that we won’t find trouble with the Yuhua God Dynasty!”
 As soon as Huang Xian’er said this, before Princess Yulin could react, the people who were paying attention to this place all erupted.
 In their opinion, this condition was too easy. The territory ruled by the Yuhua God Dynasty was very vast. It wasn’t difficult to give up the million miles of land around the Kunlun Mountains.
 Was this condition alone enough to resolve this conflict and let the Yuhua God Dynasty continue to exist?
 How could the Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains let the Yuhua God Dynasty off so easily?
 But to the surprise of these people, Princess Yulin sneered as if she had heard a joke. She said, “Are you kidding me?”
 “With the Kunlun Mountains as the center, give up all the lands within a million miles? The common people of these lands, the order of these lands, and the living creatures of these lands shall all belong to the rule of the Hundred Races?” Princess Yulin asked.
 “That’s right!” Huang Xian’er nodded coldly.
 “The land occupied by the humans is too vast. A weak race ruling the entire land. It’s time to return this land,” Huang Xian’er said matter-of-factly.
 Princess Yulin directly shook her head. “The human race is weak? The human race is constantly improving. Generations of people are becoming stronger and generations of people are growing. Are you dreaming and making a joke?”
 “15,000 years ago, the Human Race only lived in a small corner of the world. Self-preservation was a problem for them. They were food for many powerful races in the Hundred Races!” Huang Xian’er was very domineering. She said these words in public and exposed the tragic life of the Human Race 15,000 years ago.
 She was fearless.
 “Back then, not only were there the Hundred Races of our Kunlun Mountains but there were also many races in other regions. It could be said that there were tens of thousands of races existing side by side and the various kings were competing for supremacy. At that time, most humans would look for powerful races to protect and attach themselves to. They were just a small race that wasn’t worth mentioning,” Huang Xian’er said coldly.
 “Today is no longer 15,000 years ago. Today is the world of the Humans!” Princess Yulin didn’t show any weakness and said directly.
 “The era has changed!” Princess Yulin shouted as she stared at Huang Xian’er.
 “Hmph, the era has indeed changed, and the current era is indeed not that era. But now that all of our races have awakened, it’s impossible for the Human Race to continue being so comfortable. Everything can’t possibly exist as before!” Huang Xian’er’s beautiful face was cold. She let out a dense coldness and locked onto Princess Yulin.
 Boom!
 Huang Xian’er took a step forward. A strong aura pounced towards Princess Yulin alone. The others didn’t feel anything.
 Princess Yulin’s expression immediately turned serious.
 This was the pressure that belonged to the Void Returning Realm cultivator, and Princess Yulin was only at the Spirit Platform Realm.
 Bai Tiandi immediately wanted to help Princess Yulin.
 But Princess Yulin stopped him.
 “There’s no need to make a move. I’ll do it myself!” Princess Yulin said solemnly.
 “You are quite courageous, but just as I said, the bodies of you humans are too weak, you guys are no match for the Hundred Races at all. Moreover, you humans only have one False Immortal now. In the current world, in such a huge land, you guys want to rely on a single False Immortal to rule and suppress it?” Huang Xian’er’s voice exploded in Princess Yulin’s ear like thunder, wanting to destroy Princess Yulin’s mind.
 But the others only heard normal sounds.
 In the dark night, under the curtain of the galaxy, the stars were resplendent. Everyone was watching the two women.
 The two of them were both extraordinary women of the current era. Their words were so sonorous and powerful.
 “Before the era of the recovery of spiritual energy, my Yuhua God Dynasty was the number one God Dynasty in the world. But later on, it decayed and declined. The dynasty lost the support of the common people, the officials were muddled and greedy, and in the court, decay was everywhere. The Yuhua God Dynasty should have been wiped out along with the old era.” Princess Yulin gritted her teeth. Under Huang Xian’er’s aura, she straightened her plump chest and said word by word.
 Huang Xian’er watched silently.
 Everyone in the world watched silently.
 “But the heavens didn’t choose to destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty. At a time when everything was falling into the abyss and couldn’t be saved, Emperor Yuan appeared out of nowhere. He reformed the Yuhua God Dynasty and fixed all the problems. He killed the officials in large numbers, suppressed the aristocratic families, governed the sects, and saved the Yuhua God Dynasty from disaster. At the beginning of the era of spiritual energy recovery, the Yuhua God Dynasty became more prosperous by the day!”
 “It’s a pity that Emperor Yuan died young. It was Emperor Ming’s turn to succeed the throne. He continued Grandpa Emperor’s reforms all his life. He led the Yuhua God Dynasty to continue suppressing this world in the era of spiritual energy recovery. At the same time, he continued to reform the world and established the concept of ‘taking people as the foundation’. This concept was inherited by my brother, the current Emperor De of the Yuhua God Dynasty.”
 “After inheriting the throne for decades, this world has never been chaotic. The elderly have people to support them and the young have people to depend on. We treat the common people the same way. Towards the children, enrollment in school is free. Towards our land, we won’t give up a single inch of it!” Princess Yulin said firmly.
 “I know that many people think that the ideals of our Yuhua God Dynasty are too idealistic and too childish. In a vast cultivation world, instead of currying favor with those powerful cultivators, we instead treat the ordinary people well and let these people live a good life with dignity. We have offended all the factions. Be it the orthodox or the demonic sects, they all wish for the Yuhua God Dynasty to be wiped out.” Princess Yulin continued.
 Huang Xian’er listened silently, her eyes filled with an indescribable feeling.
 She couldn’t describe what this feeling was either.
 Her pressure didn’t continue to become stronger, giving Princess Yulin a chance to speak.
 Although her eyes still revealed coldness, they were no longer filled with disgust.
 Perhaps Princess Yulin’s words moved her.
 In the world, there were many idealists, but very few people would sacrifice their lives for their ideals.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty did it.
 From Emperor Yuan to Emperor Ming and then to Emperor De.
 Generations of emperors had put in their blood, sweat, and tears, even sacrificing their lives.
 During this period, many ministers racked their brains for the people of the world.
 That Cabinet Chief of the four generations even worked himself to death in his final years for Emperor De’s safety.
 Before the Cabinet Chief died, he said that he could die, but Emperor De couldn’t. If Emperor De died, the reforms of the Yuhua God Dynasty and this world would all be cut off.
 “Look around. There are so many pairs of eyes watching. These are all people who wish for the demise of our Yuhua God Dynasty. They don’t care about the common people. If I agree to the conditions that you mentioned just now, this crisis will immediately be resolved. They will be greatly disappointed and beat their chest, stomp their feet in disappointment.” Princess Yulin pointed around with a smile.
 “Then agree. Let them beat their chest and stomp their feet in disappointment!” Huang Xian’er said.
 Princess Yulin shook her head. “In that case, the common people of the world will be greatly disappointed in the Yuhua God Dynasty.”
 “Are the common people that important to you?” Huang Xian’er asked, puzzled.
 “They are important. The reason why the royal family of our Yuhua God Dynasty is the royal family is because of the people of the world. If they are around, the Yuhua God Dynasty will be around. If they are gone, even if the Yuhua God Dynasty is still around, what’s the point?” Princess Yulin nodded and replied very firmly.
 “I’ve never had to worry about food and clothing since I was young. I’m called the First Princess by them. I’m the princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty, and also the princess of the common people. I naturally have to uphold justice for the common people. Therefore, according to the request of the Hundred Races, I, Princess Yulin, on behalf of the Yuhua God Dynasty…” Princess Yulin’s eyes were stubborn. With the pressure on her, a smile appeared on her beautiful face.
 “Reject!” When she said this, her smile was very bright, like a blooming flower.
 Huang Xian’er’s eyelids drooped. She suppressed the ripples in her heart and sneered.
 “Reject?” She suddenly raised her head and looked at Princess Yulin.
 “Can you reject it?”
 “What does your Yuhua God Dynasty have?”
 “A False Immortal, right?”
 “But among the Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains, there are already nine False Immortals who have recovered!”
 “You said you reject it, but do you really think that relying on one single False Immortal can stop the emergence of the Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains?”
 “A single False Immortal wanting to continue suppressing this world?”
 “You overestimated yourself!”
 Huang Xian’er became cold and heartless. Her tone gradually became heavier, and in the end, it became a reprimand.
 Accompanied by her rebuke, nine terrifying auras came from the Kunlun Mountains that were shrouded in darkness.
 Boom!
 Boom!
 Boom!
 These auras swept through the night sky like a storm, shocking the world.
 The nine False Immortals stood alone in the Kunlun Mountains, deterring the world.
 Countless people saw it. Even from millions of miles away, they could feel these nine terrifying auras.
 The sect leaders of the various large factions turned pale at this moment. They were shocked by the aura of the False Immortals.
 But instead of being shocked, they were overjoyed.
 So what if the Yuhua God Dynasty had a False Immortal?
 There were nine False Immortals in the Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains.
 Moreover, this was only the current stage!
 Princess Yulin’s face also turned pale. Her mood instantly fell to rock bottom.
 These nine False Immortals were really too terrifying.
 “You still dare to say no in front of me?” Huang Xian’er sneered. She looked at Princess Yulin with a competitive gaze.
 She wanted to suppress Princess Yulin’s dream.
 She didn’t have such a grand dream, so she didn’t allow Princess Yulin to have one either.
 Princess Yulin and the dozen or so Void Returning Realm cultivators behind her had difficulty breathing at this moment.
 This…
 This…
 This…
 No one could speak.
 “Do you know?” Huang Xian’er looked at Princess Yulin. Victory was in her hands. With a leisurely pace, she walked over and reached out to stroke Princess Yulin’s face. The two beautiful faces were placed together and they almost kissed.
 Huang Xian’er suddenly turned around and said in Princess Yulin’s ear, “Your Yuhua God Dynasty and your ideals are not worth mentioning in front of absolute strength!”
 Princess Yulin gritted her teeth. At this moment, a figure appeared in her mind.
 A white-robed man who was calmly drinking tea and had an immortal-like temperament.
 “I… I believe in him!” Princess Yulin said softly and firmly.
 Nothing could stop her Big Grand-Uncle.
 …
 In the imperial capital, in the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng put down his teacup and looked at the Kunlun Mountains.
 “Silly girl, you trust me so much?” Lin Jiufeng smiled gently, feeling very gratified.
 The granddaughter that he raised didn’t let him down.
 Lin Jiufeng watched everything that happened just now.
 The corner of his mouth curled up as he said, “Since you trust me so much, I can’t disappoint you, right?”
 “Isn’t it just nine False Immortals? It isn’t like they are existences that can destroy the world.” Lin Jiufeng got up and walked to the door of the Cold Palace.
 A lamp hung at the entrance all year round.
 [Light of the Homes!]
 When he signed in for this years ago, Lin Jiufeng had never used it until now.
 [Light of the Homes] had also been absorbing the light of the homes in the mortal world.
 “After putting you here for so long, it’s time for you to make a move. Let the people of the world know that the lights of the common people of the world cannot be underestimated,” Lin Jiufeng looked at the [Light of the Homes] and said.
 [Light of the Homes] flickered slightly. The weak candle flame jumped as if it was responding to Lin Jiufeng’s words. Then, it broke free from where it was hanging and floated in front of Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng held it and shook it gently. Then, the light of the [Light of the Homes] spread out.
 …
 At the end of the distant world, on a majestic black mountain, nine terrifying auras suppressed the world.
 Princess Yulin and Huang Xian’er were like close friends. They hugged together and their faces were close to each other.
 Huang Xian’er looked at Princess Yulin with a victorious smile on her face.
 She was confident of her victory and was very triumphant. She said to Princess Yulin, “If you agree to be my maid, I will shorten the area of a million miles to 500,000 miles. How about that?”
 Princess Yulin bit her red lips and looked at Huang Xian’er angrily.
 But suddenly, an unusual aura came from heaven and earth.
 She focused her gaze and saw a huge painting of the world in the dark.
 The resplendent light turned the night into day. Then, everyone could see that in the direction of the distant imperial capital, a painting of the common people in the world flew towards the Kunlun Mountains.
 This resplendent light illuminated the ground. The light was spiritual and warm as if it illuminated the past, present, and future!
 In this light, there were men farming, women weaving, children smiling, scholars teaching, and fishermen fishing…
 These people all had smiles on their faces.
 This painting of the world was so beautiful that it made those with dark hearts unable to look at it directly.
 It looked like it was painted by the most ordinary person. The entire painting was resplendent and dazzling.
 At this moment, this Painting of the People transformed into an eternal streak of holy light that came from the imperial capital. It rampaged through the vast world at a speed that exceeded everyone’s imagination. With a flash of light, it crossed thousands of miles, cut through space, and descended in front of the Kunlun Mountains.
 This was a kind of miracle in the mortal world. The Painting of the People seemed to be able to traverse the three thousand worlds, piercing through Yin and Yang and emitting the immortal divinity of the people.
 Existing as long as the world, competing with the sun and moon.
 “What terrifying magic treasure is this?” On the ground in front of the Kunlun Mountains, countless sect masters couldn’t help but kneel down, indescribably shocked.
 “Is this a true immortal artifact?” Many people were trembling. Under this pressure, they spat out large mouthfuls of blood and knelt for a long time, their faces filled with fear.
 At this moment, the immortal divine light penetrated the Yuhua God Dynasty. Every figure and every trajectory of life on the painting was like a heavenly chasm. It split the sky, tore through the darkness, and let the great world of light descend into this world.
 At this moment, the [Light of the Homes] completely displayed its might.
 The light was incomparably resplendent as if it had been moving unhindered for millions of years.
 What remained unchanged since time immemorial was the passing down of generations of ordinary people.
 The past, the present, and the future had always been like this.
 This Painting of the People was as heavy as tens of thousands of tons. Light burst out millions of times, crushing the void.
 After descending to the Kunlun Mountains at an extremely shocking speed, the Painting of the People descended with auspicious energy that filled the sky. It was as if it was reversing time and returning to 15,000 years ago.
 That was the peak of the Hundred Races in the Kunlun Mountains. It was an era where all races existed together. The human race was extremely small, but the Painting of the People at this moment was like the light of ascension. It illuminated every inch of the world one after another, telling the people of the past and present.
 The common people also had what they wanted to protect and persevere for.
 The interior of the Kunlun Mountains was illuminated. A supreme pressure rumbled down, causing the Hundred Races to tremble. Countless people couldn’t withstand this pressure and began to scream.
 Boom!
 At this moment, the Painting of the People fluttered. Then, vast and mighty auras came crashing down from all directions, directly drowning out the auras of the nine False Immortals.
 In the Kunlun Mountains, the False Immortals counterattacked. There was a rumbling sound as they fought with the painting.
 This was an extremely shocking scene. The nine False Immortals attacked together and fought against the mysterious painting.
 An extremely terrifying and rare scene.
 Everyone was dumbfounded.
 The sect leaders who spat out blood from the pressure watched in horror.
 It was the same for Huang Xian’er. Her smugness and confidence in winning just now disappeared at this moment.
 “Is this from your Yuhua God Dynasty?” Huang Xian’er stared at Princess Yulin’s blue pupils and asked.
 “I told you that the Yuhua God Dynasty would dare to reject the Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains, but you didn’t believe me,” Princess Yulin said happily. She knew that her Big Grand-Uncle had made a move.
 In a good mood, she even reached out to touch Huang Xian’er’s skin and said with a smile, “The Yuhua God Dynasty protects the common people, and the common people will also protect the Yuhua God Dynasty. This is something that you Hundred Races don’t understand. Don’t be so triumphant next time, it will be very embarrassing.”
 Huang Xian’er’s expression changed. She no longer cared about Princess Yulin. Her eyes were fixed on the Kunlun Mountains as the nine False Immortals fought against the Painting of the People.
 This battle lasted for three days and three nights, shaking the world. The Painting of the People finally disappeared, but the nine False Immortals in the Kunlun Mountains were also exhausted.
 This time, it was a draw.
 But they definitely didn’t dare to underestimate the Yuhua God Dynasty anymore.
 “Just you wait. I will definitely take you in as my maid next time.” Before Huang Xianer left, she reached out and touched Princess Yulin’s body part that was round in shape, saying ruthlessly.
 This infuriated Bai Tiandi.

                    



 Chapter 245: Dark Land of Extremely Negative Energy  
 The painting completely suppressed the auras of the nine False Immortals in the Kunlun Mountains.
 Although Huang Xian’er was unwilling, she had to retreat. She didn’t expect that the Yuhua God Dynasty had such a powerful magic treasure.
 No, this was no longer a magic treasure.
 This was an immortal artifact!
 Moreover, it was an immortal artifact that had been completely activated. Only by awakening the [Soul] in the immortal artifact could it have such a might.
 Huang Xian’er’s retreat represented that the Kunlun Mountains’ plan this time had completely failed.
 It also represented that the prestige of the Yuhua God Dynasty would rise to another level.
 In an instant, the news spread all over the world.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty used a painting of the people to suppress the nine False Immortals in the Kunlun Mountains, causing the world to erupt.
 The common people were overjoyed. They could all feel the extremely terrifying auras and the might of the painting. It resisted the Kunlun Mountains and protected the common people of the world. They gathered together and cheered in excitement.
 Although the people of the world were happy, the various sect masters were unhappy.
 They originally thought that the Kunlun Mountains would most probably win. The nine terrifying auras from the Kunlun Mountains caused countless people to be shocked, feeling that the Yuhua God Dynasty would definitely collapse.
 Especially when Princess Yulin rejected Huang Xianer’s request.
 These people really thought that Princess Yulin was seeking death, that the Yuhua God Dynasty was seeking death.
 But when the painting appeared, it suppressed them until they spat out blood. Their bodies trembled and almost cracked. Then, they didn’t think so anymore.
 “Who would have thought that there would actually be an immortal artifact hidden inside the Yuhua God Dynasty? An immortal artifact that has completely awakened too.” A demonic sect master gnashed his teeth in hatred. His heart simply wanted to vomit blood.
 He felt aggrieved!
 They were all waiting for the Yuhua God Dynasty to fall into pieces and be destroyed by the False Immortals in the Kunlun Mountains. Who would have thought that the Yuhua God Dynasty would make it through and suppress the Kunlun Mountains instead?
 “The immortal artifact isn’t terrifying. What’s terrifying is a fully awakened immortal artifact. Such an immortal artifact requires extremely powerful strength to support its usage. Only a False Immortal who has at least transcended several lightning tribulations can have enough magic power to use a fully awakened immortal artifact. Is the Yuhua God Dynasty’s False Immortal that powerful?” A Daoist Sect Master questioned.
 “Whether he’s that powerful or not is no longer meaningful now. The Yuhua God Dynasty has suppressed the nine False Immortals in the Kunlun Mountains. The might of the Yuhua God Dynasty has surged and is incomparably powerful. It’s impossible for the Yuhua God Dynasty to be wiped out now. Instead, the support of the people in it has increased. What logic is this?” Someone said in dejection.
 “There’s no need to be so dejected. The Yuhua God Dynasty’s move this time is unexpected, but didn’t you see that after fighting the nine enemies alone for three days and three nights, the portrait still didn’t kill a single False Immortal? This means that although the Yuhua God Dynasty has a trump card, it isn’t that powerful. Moreover, they are unable to continue suppressing so many people.” Seeing that these people were depressed, the Sect Leader of the Zenith Heaven Path immediately stood out to cheer everyone up.
 “Sect Leader of the Zenith Heaven Path, you’ve said so much, but why don’t I see you stepping forward to resist the Yuhua God Dynasty? You are now the sharpest sword under Emperor De of the Yuhua God Dynasty. Emperor De used you guys and killed many sects that resisted them. Your Zenith Heaven Path is the biggest lackey of the Yuhua God Dynasty,” a demonic cultivator said in a strange manner.
 “Indeed!” The others nodded. Even though the Zenith Heaven Path was unwilling, it was indeed the sharpest knife in Emperor De’s hands during all these years.
 Even the war machine wasn’t as useful as the Zenith Heaven Path in dealing with these small sects and the hidden enemies of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Because the war machine was too powerful, it spent most of its time recovering on its own, absorbing spiritual energy, and recovering to its peak.
 Unless absolutely needed, Emperor De didn’t want to trouble the war machine. Therefore, when he encountered sects that were going against the national policy of the Yuhua God Dynasty or aristocratic families that were abusing their power, he would send an order to the Zenith Heaven Path and give them a limit of three days to completely eliminate this sect or aristocratic family.
 In troubled times, forceful methods should be used.
 The interior of the Yuhua God Dynasty was peaceful and the common people lived a happy life.
 But this era was a chaotic one.
 The historical books recorded that every era of spiritual energy recovery was a chaotic era.
 The golden age of cultivators was an extremely tough age for those who weren’t cultivators.
 Even cultivators could also easily die and be killed in such an era.
 The recovery of spiritual energy was a tragedy of blood and bone.
 In such an era, only geniuses and ambitious people were the happiest.
 It was the same in the previous eras and had never been changed. But it was different now.
 In this era, not only was there no large-scale bleeding, but the common people also benefited from the recovery of spiritual energy. Their bodies were healthy, their lifespans were extended, and their cultivation was smooth.
 This was the true meaning of the Yuhua God Dynasty’s existence.
 That was why these sects that wanted to seize the opportunity to rise up and recover their past glory were so dissatisfied.
 They couldn’t wait to completely overthrow the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The Sect Leader of the Zenith Heaven Path stood forward at this moment. Being questioned by everyone, he hurriedly explained, “Everyone knows that after the Zenith Heaven Path recovered, we were controlled by the Yuhua God Dynasty. Also, during these years, the Yuhua God Dynasty took away the war machine and used it to threaten us. We have no choice but to compromise and follow.”
 But no one believed this explanation. Everyone sneered. The Yuhua God Dynasty was at its peak now. It seemed that the Kunlun Mountains wouldn’t be a threat to the Yuhua God Dynasty for the time being.
 Hence, some sect masters sighed helplessly. Another crisis was resolved by the Yuhua God Dynasty. They hid in the dark and didn’t dare to make a move. If they really angered the Yuhua God Dynasty and were targeted, they wouldn’t have nine False Immortals to protect them.
 “Let’s wait. It won’t be long before my ancestor can recover.” At this moment, the various sect masters comforted themselves in their hearts.
 The Ancient Kunlun Mountains had already recovered. The huge amount of spiritual energy it brought was surging into the world. In the future, the amount of spiritual energy would be increasing by large amounts every moment.
 They would just have to wait for at most one year before their own False Immortals could descend into this world.
 Hence, they could still wait.
 …
 The Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains were extremely unwilling to accept this result.
 Especially the Nest of 10,000 Dragons. After Huang Xian’er returned, she directly went to look for the False Immortal Patriarch.
 The False Immortal Patriarch of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons was also a woman. She was relatively beautiful. Her body was slender and light, her skin was snow-white, almost transparent like jade.
 In the eyes of outsiders, she was covered in seven-colored light and it was difficult to see her face.
 But in Huang Xian’er’s eyes, her ancestor’s face was clearly visible.
 The beautiful ancestor’s eyes were sharp and her figure was round in the appropriate places. It would be difficult for men to resist her.
 Her beautiful hair was smooth and soft. She walked towards Huang Xian’er step by step, like a goddess.
 “Are you in a bad mood?” The Patriarch asked.
 “Big Sister Divine Silkworm, we made a huge commotion and returned to this source world, planning to restore the glory of 15,000 years ago. But now, we are being suppressed by the Yuhua God Dynasty just like this?” Huang Xian’er asked, puzzled.
 The current False Immortal Patriarch of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons was a Divine Silkworm. She taught Huang Xian’er since she was young, but she always asked Huang Xian’er to call her Big Sister and not Patriarch.
 “Have you witnessed the might of that painting just now?” Sister Divine Silkworm asked.
 “I’ve seen it. It’s indeed very powerful, but I believe that Sister Divine Silkworm will definitely be able to defeat it. Didn’t Sister Divine Silkworm say that you had already transcended one lightning tribulation?” Huang Xian’er asked.
 “That’s right. I did transcend one lightning tribulation, but do you know something?” Sister Divine Silkworm looked at Huang Xian’er in a strange manner.
 “What?” Huang Xian’er looked at Big Sister Divine Silkworm, puzzled.
 “If I were to completely go all out, I would be able to fight against it, but not the others,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 The Ancient Kunlun Mountains had appeared, and the powerhouses inside were also gradually recovering. It was absolutely impossible for all of them to recover in a short period.
 “Those top False Immortals have no way of forcefully wasting time. They can only choose to continue sleeping and wait for an opportunity. When the Ancient Kunlun Mountains were sealed, it was impossible for them to ascend. Therefore, among the awakened False Immortals, I’m the only one who has successfully transcended the tribulation. The others have only just broken through to the False Immortal Realm and haven’t even transcended a single lightning tribulation,” Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 “Since Sister Divine Silkworm can fight against the Painting of the People, why did the nine of you fight for three days and three nights, increasing the prestige of the Yuhua God Dynasty for no reason?” Huang Xian’er didn’t understand why she did this.
 Sister Divine Silkworm smiled and said, “You’re still too young. I’ve always taught you how to cultivate in the past, but I forgot to teach you about the evil of the human heart.”
 “Do you think that the Hundred Races living in the Kunlun Mountains will advance and retreat together?” Sister Divine Silkworm asked.
 Huang Xian’er frowned. Wasn’t that the case?
 She had always thought so in the past. The Kunlun Mountains and the Hundred Races sounded like a group.
 Sister Divine Silkworm said solemnly, “Don’t believe in others. The so-called Hundred Races, even in the era where all races existed side by side 15,000 years ago, didn’t have a so-called collective concept.”
 Huang Xian’er took a deep breath. It was only now that she finally knew about this matter.
 “The era of the tens of thousands of races was an era of blood and death. The killing was a common occurrence. Every day, a race was wiped out, and every day, mountains of corpses and seas of blood would appear. It was also a common thing for powerful monsters to devour tens of thousands of people on a whim. At that time, the Hundred Races of the Kunlun Mountains also fought against each other. At that time, the Nest of 10,000 Dragons ruled a region and established a God Dynasty. We wanted to protect the people and the major races of the God Dynasty, but we failed in the end. At that time, the races of the Kunlun Mountains ate our people as much as they wanted and were unscrupulous. This is a bloody reality,” Sister Divine Silkworm sighed and said.
 “This is actually the case…” Huang Xian’er was shocked.
 Although she was older than Princess Yulin, she really didn’t experience as much as Princess Yulin.
 Princess Yulin had grown up in the God Dynasty. Her father passed away when she was in her teens. Then, she was almost forced to be married to the barbarians of Xianbei.
 Fortunately, she met Lin Jiufeng, who brought her to the Plains. She cut Wolf Storey Mountain in halves with Lin Jiufeng’s sword and was guided onto the path of cultivation. Along the way, when troubles came, she braved the wind and rain and overcame the obstacles to achieve her current achievements.
 Princess Yulin even took over the intelligence organization that Emperor De spent decades building and became the biggest intelligence leader of the Yuhua God Dynasty. She had seen all sorts of dirty things and experienced all sorts of dark human hearts.
 However, despite experiencing these, Princess Yulin’s heart was still as precious as gold.
 Huang Xian’er didn’t have so much experience. The Ancient Kunlun Mountains were sealed, so the Huang Xian’er didn’t have much to compete for. Therefore, they rested and recuperated. The powerhouses chose to seal themselves and extend their lives because they didn’t want to be awake and wait for death. So slowly, Huang Xian’er was mystified by the so-called Hundred Races.
 She believed that the Hundred Races should help each other, and the Hundred Races should be a single collective group.
 But now, Sister Divine Silkworm was telling her solemnly and coldly that this wasn’t the case.
 The Hundred Races was illusory propaganda. The nature of the various races was to kill each other. Each race was to step on the corpse of another race to improve their own cultivation base.
 Together, these things allowed Huang Xian’er to undergo a transformation.
 Sister Divine Silkworm continued, “This time, the Yuhua God Dynasty came to suppress the emergence of the Ancient Kunlun Mountains. You know what the decision is after the various major races discussed this matter. Firstly, maintain our composure and ask for a territory with a radius of a million miles. Secondly, when the various old ancestors have all recovered, we will destroy the agreement and seek to rule the entire world.”
 Huang Xian’er nodded. This was also what led to her being chosen to discuss this with Princess Yulin.
 “But no one expected that the Yuhua God Dynasty would be so powerful. The appearance of the Painting of the People caught everyone off guard. The other False Immortals and I couldn’t do anything about it, so we need to stay quiet for now.”
 “Sister Divine Silkworm, didn’t you just say that you could fight with that painting if you attacked with your full strength?” Huang Xian’er asked, puzzled.
 The expression on Big Sister Divine Silkworm’s face became complicated. She looked at Huang Xian’er and said faintly, “If I tell you that the Painting of the People we saw is essentially a ball of light and not the true form of that terrifying magic treasure, will you believe me?”
 “What?” Huang Xian’er looked at Big Sister Divine Silkworm in shock.
 Sister Divine Silkworm smiled bitterly. “I could only resist a ball of light sent from that magic treasure when I attacked with all my might. If we don’t keep a low profile and really attract the False Immortal of the Yuhua God Dynasty to come here, it will be a catastrophe for the current Nest of 10,000 Dragons.”
 “Is the Yuhua God Dynasty actually so terrifying?” Huang Xian’er was shocked and speechless.
 “It’s that person in the Yuhua God Dynasty who’s terrifying!” Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 …
 Princess Yulin looked at the majestic Kunlun Mountains and heaved a sigh of relief.
 Three days ago, the situation was very subtle at the time. Nine False Immortal Realm cultivators appeared out of nowhere and intimidated the world. They wanted to threaten the Yuhua God Dynasty to give up the land within a million-mile radius. That was really a great test for her.
 But she still bore it and firmly refused.
 Then, the Painting of the People that represented the people of the world appeared out of thin air. It illuminated the entire Yuhua God Dynasty, causing countless people and countless factions to be shocked. It was as if they had seen something incredible.
 The painting didn’t disappoint the Yuhua God Dynasty. It successfully suppressed the nine False Immortals of the Kunlun Mountains.
 The nine False Immortals joined forces, but they only managed to end up in a tie with a single painting. This itself was a big problem.
 Hence, Princess Yulin was incomparably happy now. With a dazzling smile on her beautiful face, she turned around and said to Fire Lord and the others, “There should be no problem from the Kunlun Mountains for the time being. I reckon that they won’t cause trouble any time soon.”
 Fire Lord laughed out loud and said, “After the appearance of the painting, if they still want to continue causing trouble, they are just seeking death.”
 “The Painting of the People is too terrifying. Each of its auras can suppress me to death.” Old Man Luo clicked his tongue, extremely envious.
 “Is this Painting of the People the trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty?” A friend who was invited by Bai Tiandi asked curiously.
 Everyone looked at Princess Yulin.
 Since this matter concerned the Yuhua God Dynasty, this question could only be answered by Princess Yulin.
 Princess Yulin shook her head gently and said, “The greatest trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty is never a painting, but a person.”
 “A person?” The few people who were invited looked at Princess Yulin in surprise.
 What did this mean?
 There was someone stronger than the Painting of the People?
 As for Bai Tiandi and the other three, their expressions were subtle as they thought of Mr. Lin.
 Princess Yulin’s words were correct. The trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty would never be anything else but a person.
 The number one immortal in the world!
 Mr. Lin.
 Princess Yulin smiled very happily, but she shook her head and didn’t answer this question.
 The people who were invited also knew that this question was a little presumptuous.
 “We brothers were invited here, but we weren’t of any help at all. Instead, we witnessed the incomparable beauty of this painting. Our horizons were broadened, but at the same time, we couldn’t help but feel guilty,” a quiet Void Returning cultivator said in shame.
 “No, it’s the opposite. Instead, I feel that your arrival is the greatest gain for the Yuhua God Dynasty. I wonder if the Yuhua God Dynasty has the honor to invite you all to join us. You won’t be restrained and can come and go freely as the royal consecrators of the Yuhua God Dynasty.” Princess Yulin invited sincerely. These eight Void Returning Realms that came to help were a huge force. If they really become members of the Yuhua God Dynasty, it would definitely be a joyous matter.
 “This…”
 The eight Void Returning cultivators who were invited looked at each other. Some were tempted, some hesitated, and some were thinking.
 “Don’t hesitate. Everyone has seen how powerful the Yuhua God Dynasty is. At the same time, everyone knows how much the Yuhua God Dynasty favors the common people. If you don’t join, are you going to continue being a rogue cultivator and fight alone? In this world that is about to return to its peak, it will be very difficult being alone.” Bai Tiandi advised.
 “Everyone, you guys have heard of my name, Fire Lord. I’m about to break through to the False Immortal Realm, but I still joined the Yuhua God Dynasty and listened to Emperor De’s orders. It’s for no other reason than for a bright future and also to do something good for the people of this world,” Fire Lord said solemnly.
 “Everyone, there’s no need to worry about not having a sense of belonging in the Yuhua God Dynasty. As the saying goes, a place of peace is our hometown. A dynasty like the Yuhua God Dynasty has never been seen before since ancient times. Being able to join in and create a glorious era together, I guarantee that everyone will definitely be able to break through to the False Immortal Realm.” Old Man Luo also joined in the persuasion.
 King Kaoshan was about to speak.
 Unexpectedly, the eight of them looked at each other and agreed directly.
 “Princess Yulin, the eight of us are all willing to join the Yuhua God Dynasty and follow the Yuhua God Dynasty to establish a glorious dynasty. This is because the princess has said that the Yuhua God Dynasty uses people as the foundation. If this ideal changes in the future, we brothers will leave.” Among the eight, the most powerful cultivator, the quiet scholar, said solemnly.
 Just like Fire Lord, he was at the peak of the Void Returning Realm, one step into the False Immortal Realm.
 He was known as Scholar Wen. He cultivated the Energy of Uprightness, and his nature was of the orthodox path. After seeing the ideals of the Yuhua God Dynasty, he agreed with them greatly. So at this moment, he represented the other seven and made the request.
 “No problem. As long as everyone discovers that the Yuhua God Dynasty is bad to the common people and has lost the ideal of doing good to the people, feel free to leave,” Princess Yulin was overjoyed and said happily.
 She was very confident in this.
 Because once they lost their reputation as being good to the people, not to mention the common people, even Big Grand-Uncle also probably wouldn’t care about the Yuhua God Dynasty anymore.
 If that happened, the Yuhua God Dynasty would be seeking death. By that time, it was only natural that these people would leave.
 “Everyone, we will guard here for a month. If there is no movement from the Kunlun Mountains after a month, then that means they aren’t planning to make a move at all,” Princess Yulin said.
 The others nodded. They also believed that the Kunlun Mountains wouldn’t dare to do anything anymore.
 The Painting of the People was too terrifying.
 …
 In the imperial capital, after the painting flew out, Lin Jiufeng hung up the [Light of the Homes].
 “In this case, the Hundred Races in the Kunlun Mountains will be a little quieter, right?” Lin Jiufeng said to himself.
 The [Light of the Homes] had been absorbing the scent of lives of the common people. The more stable the lives of the common people were, the stronger the [Light of the Homes] became.
 Lin Jiufeng continued to hang it up. The light that flew out was enough to deter the nine False Immortals in the Kunlun Mountains.
 But now wasn’t the time for it to truly appear.
 “Meow, why didn’t you go personally?” The white cat came out and asked Lin Jiufeng curiously.
 “If I have to take action for everything, will the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty still have room to grow?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 He could solve the Hundred Races in the Kunlun Mountains and the nine False Immortals.
 But these people couldn’t overthrow the Yuhua God Dynasty anyway. Leaving them alive could still temper Princess Yulin and the others, spurring their growth.
 Of course, the most important problem was that Lin Jiufeng had more important things to do.
 The Land of Extremely Negative Energy!
 The Land of Extremely Negative Energy beneath the Cold Palace was Lin Jiufeng’s old friend.
 In the past, Lin Jiufeng’s gains in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy were huge. He obtained a lot of treasures, but as he gradually became stronger, he discovered that the Land of Extremely Negative Energy had become increasingly useless.
 Lin Jiufeng once thought that the Land of Extremely Negative Energy was of no use to him anymore.
 But reality proved that he was still too young and naive.
 The fact that the Land of Extremely Negative Energy could cause countless top powerhouses and countless sect masters to fight over it in the previous era proved the importance of this place.
 There was a huge secret in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. It was definitely not as simple as it appeared to be now.
 Especially after Lin Jiufeng transcended the tribulation, he truly felt the difference in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 Even though it was blocked by a very deep layer of earth and the Cold Place, Lin Jiufeng still sensed something special coming from the Land of Extreme Negative Energy.
 In order to explore the Land of Extremely Negative Energy, Lin Jiufeng resisted the urge to go out and find places to sign in. After stabilizing his cultivation base that had skyrocketed after transcending the tribulation, he began to make preparations seriously.
 He once again entered the Land of Extremely Negative Energy!
 This was the first time in the few months since he returned to the imperial capital that he was preparing to go to the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 Previously, he didn’t go down to visit the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. On the one hand, he was preparing to transcend the tribulation, so Lin Jiufeng didn’t want to divert his attention. The outcome of multitasking was often that one couldn’t do anything well.
 On the other hand, Lin Jiufeng felt that he wouldn’t discover anything even if he went down.
 The Land of Extremely Negative Energy was as usual. He didn’t sense any special movement coming from it.
 There were several times when he went down and wanted to open the Land of Extremely Negative Energy, but he chose to give up even though it was already within reach.
 But this time was different. After Lin Jiufeng succeeded in transcending the tribulation, he faintly felt the fluctuations of the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 Only those who were transcending the tribulation could sense this fluctuation.
 If it were anyone else, they would have to undergo at least two or three tribulations to feel it.
 But Lin Jiufeng’s divine soul was powerful. After the baptism of the tribulation, it became increasingly terrifying. Only then did he sense it.
 But Lin Jiufeng wasn’t in a hurry. He stabilized his mentality, then stabilized his realm and combat strength before deciding to go down.
 As for the Kunlun Mountains?
 To Lin Jiufeng, it was just an incident. After scaring them with the [Light of the Homes], Lin Jiufeng ignored them.
 With Princess Yulin and the Void Returning Realm cultivators guarding the Kunlun Mountains, it wouldn’t pose a problem.
 They probably didn’t have the guts to offend the Yuhua God Dynasty again.
 After Lin Jiufeng was done with his preparations, he prepared to go to the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 The white cat wanted to go with Lin Jiufeng.
 But Lin Jiufeng didn’t allow her.
 “This time, I have a strange feeling that there’s an inexplicable danger in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. It’s not suitable for you to follow.”
 The white cat meowed and then looked at Lin Jiufeng with her watery eyes. She didn’t speak, just giving off a pitiful look.
 Lin Jiufeng turned around and left.
 He didn’t want to bring the little white cat along.
 Meow ~
 The mournful meow of a cat made Lin Jiufeng stop in his tracks.
 Lin Jiufeng turned around helplessly. He spread his arms and said, “I’ll bring you along.”
 “Meow, meow, meow. I knew that you couldn’t bear to leave me alone, and I also couldn’t bear to leave you. If we encounter danger, we can just face it together,” the white cat said happily. She jumped into Lin Jiufeng’s arms, stretched out her pink tongue, and licked Lin Jiufeng’s palm. It was very intimate.
 “What if we really encounter danger?” Lin Jiufeng looked at the little white cat.
 “As long as I’m with you, I’m not afraid of any danger,” the white cat said firmly.
 “Let’s go.” Lin Jiufeng’s lips curled up. He wanted to smile, but he resisted it with all his might.
 “If you want to smile, just smile. What’s the use of pretending to be aloof in front of me?” The white cat mumbled.
 “If you continue talking, I won’t bring you along anymore,” Lin Jiufeng said coldly.
 “I won’t talk anymore. I just like to see your aloof appearance. You look very cool that way. Continue to maintain it.” The white cat squeezed out a smile and even rubbed her little head in Lin Jiufeng’s arms.
 Life was tough, being a cat was also tough.
 Lin Jiufeng carried the little white cat and walked through the underground passageway to the entrance of the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 Opening the seal, the Land of Extremely Negative Energy was shrouded in darkness.
 A line of words appeared before Lin Jiufeng’s eyes.
 [Do you want to Sign-In at the Dark Land of Extremely Negative Energy?]

                    



 Chapter 246: She’s Waiting for Me!  
 Dark Land of Extremely Negative Energy?
 This was a term that Lin Jiufeng had never heard before.
 ?
 The Land of Extremely Negative Energy was originally very dark in the first place. It had always existed deep underground and had never seen light.
 Logically speaking, there shouldn’t be any so-called darkness in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 Because the entire Land of Extremely Negative Energy was dark.
 “As expected, there’s a big secret in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.” Lin Jiufeng’s heart lit up. This time, he would discover the buried secrets of this place.
 “Sign in!” Lin Jiufeng agreed.
 He would agree every time to signing in. After all, he was the one who obtained the treasures. It wasn’t like he would lose anything from signing in.
 [Sign-In successful. Received Soul Summoning Banner!]
 These simple words announced that Lin Jiufeng had obtained a magic treasure.
 But was this Soul Summoning Banner very powerful?
 Lin Jiufeng looked through the information of the Soul Summoning Banner with a suspicious attitude.
 [The ability to summon the ancient souls lost in the mortal world!]
 This sentence told Lin Jiufeng that this was the only use of the Soul Summoning Banner.
 The Soul Summoning Banner didn’t have much use in terms of attacking and defending.
 “But where should I go to summon the souls?” Lin Jiufeng raised his brows. It wasn’t like he needed these souls.
 “It seems that I signed in for a useless item.” Lin Jiufeng was a little disappointed. He put away the Soul Summoning Banner and looked at the familiar yet unfamiliar Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 It was familiar because Lin Jiufeng had once lived here for a very, very long time.
 Lin Jiufeng had signed in every tomb of the top powerhouses who died in battle here in the previous era.
 He measured the entire Land of Extremely Negative Energy with his feet and remembered all the places he walked.
 Outsiders feared the Land of Extremely Negative Energy like common people fearing a tiger, but Lin Jiufeng treated it calmly.
 But such a familiar Land of Extremely Negative Energy today gave Lin Jiufeng an unfamiliar aura.
 Stepping into the Land of Extremely Negative Energy, it was still as dark as ever. But compared to before, the current Land of Extremely Negative Energy had a dim light in the darkness, illuminating the area ahead.
 In that place, an extremely terrifying storm was brewing.
 But Lin Jiufeng saw a huge mountain.
 No, it was a mountain range.
 The mountain range came very suddenly and was very far from Lin Jiufeng. That was why he could see the entire mountain range.
 This huge mountain range was located deep in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. It was extremely huge and meandered like an ancient Azure Dragon. It was extremely terrifying.
 Looking from afar, the mountain range revealed a majestic and lofty aura. It was as if it had already stood tall here since the beginning of the universe. It didn’t look out of place at all.
 In the mountain range, there were countless mountains, each of which could be called the king of the mountains and the emperor of the mountains. Their auras were all very majestic.
 The peak of the mountains was lush and filled with ancient trees that reached the sky. They looked full of life.
 In the centermost area, from Lin Jiufeng’s current distance, there was a lake decorating the mountainous area. It was pure and bright, like a mirror, reflecting the dark Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 But even so, it was difficult to hide the natural color of this mountain range—pitch-black.
 “Since when was there such a place in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “That’s right. When we came here previously, this place didn’t exist.” The white cat watched curiously.
 The last time she followed Lin Jiufeng into this place, she had lived here for a long time and was very familiar with the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. Therefore, she was very sure that there wasn’t such a mountain range in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 It was definitely born in the years after they left.
 “Let’s walk over and take a look. Perhaps this mountain range is also hidden like the Ancient Kunlun Mountains. It has only revealed its true form now,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 This was extremely possible.
 Otherwise, it would be very difficult to explain why such a huge mountain range appeared and expanded the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 “That should be the case, but even though this Land of Extremely Negative Energy underground has expanded, there’s no movement outside at all,” the white cat mumbled.
 Lin Jiufeng immediately thought of the [Light of the Homes].
 It was because of the [Light of the Homes] that stopped all movement in the Cold Palace. Even though the Land of Extremely Negative Energy had expanded, even though this mountain range wasn’t much worse than the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, outsiders didn’t notice it at all.
 The commotion caused by the Ancient Kunlun Mountains was known to the world.
 But only Lin Jiufeng noticed the commotion in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy after transcending the tribulation.
 It had to be said that the [Light of the Homes] was really one of the top items that Lin Jiufeng had signed in for.
 “Let’s go and take a look at this mountain range.” Lin Jiufeng walked towards this huge mountain range.
 Lin Jiufeng’s speed was very fast. Only when he arrived at this mountain range could he feel how huge and majestic this mountain range was from a close distance.
 He entered the black mountain range and first entered a primitive area. The vast wilderness was boundless. Many ancient trees towered into the sky. They were entirely black and emitted a dazzling color. Some thousand-year-old ancient trees and ten-thousand-year-old trees were like small mountains. They also had no natural enemies. There were also ancient vines that grew infinitely long and entangled some ancient trees that were like mountains. Then, these vines wrapped them up and buried them underneath.
 Everything around him was too primitive. These vines had grown for who knew how many years. They should have long transformed into powerful monsters. Unfortunately, the Land of Extremely Negative Energy absorbed all the energy, so it was very difficult to give birth to life here.
 The vines and ancient trees were still in their original forms. They weren’t sentient yet. They had no fortuitous encounters now, they also wouldn’t have many chances to become sentient and transform into monsters in the future.
 Lin Jiufeng looked around. The lush trees, the black soil, and the black cliffs looked ancient and mysterious.
 “What exactly is this place?” Lin Jiufeng walked inside. His divine soul spread. After transcending the tribulation, his divine soul was like raging flames that burned fiercely. This was a divine soul that had existed after being struck and tempered by the lightning tribulation. In this mountain range, his divine soul frantically examined every inch of it.
 After walking for a long time, Lin Jiufeng still didn’t find anything abnormal. This huge black mountain range was silent as a whole. There weren’t even any crows.
 Death-like silence!
 In the entire mountain range, only Lin Jiufeng’s own voice could be heard. It was extremely oppressive. In front of him, there was a huge black mountain that was like a sharp sword, oppressing Lin Jiufeng, making his divine soul feel extreme pressure.
 “I feel like my divine soul is being grabbed by someone,” the white cat said, feeling uncomfortable.
 “I’ll protect you. Stay on my shoulder and wait quietly,” Lin Jiufeng said solemnly. Daoist techniques burned around him, and the Yuhua Immortal Robe that he signed in for emitted a luster that shrouded the little white cat.
 The Yuhua Immortal Robe was an immortal artifact. It could withstand all evil, mental attacks, and terrifying divine soul attacks. It was perfect for resisting the pressure from the huge black mountain.
 Only when the little white cat no longer felt uncomfortable did Lin Jiufeng move forward with peace of mind.
 Although he also felt the pressure, this little pressure was still no problem for Lin Jiufeng. He walked into the sword-like mountain peak in front of him.
 After entering the black mountain, Lin Jiufeng immediately saw an ancient tree.
 This was an ancient tree hidden in the middle of a few huge stones.
 On this ancient tree, leaves of different colors and shapes grew.
 This was a rare scene where colors other than black appeared on the huge black mountain.
 The leaves of the ancient tree were of different colors.
 Some were golden, some were crimson, and some were pure white…
 Every leaf flickered with a warm light, flowing with delicate brilliance and charm.
 The trunk of this ancient tree was as strong as a dragon. It took root on the huge black mountain and absorbed nutrients.
 Lin Jiufeng was about to walk over and take a look, but he discovered that the ancient tree had disappeared.
 Everything that happened just now seemed to be an illusion, they didn’t exist at all.
 The ancient tree, the colorful leaves, and the dragon-like trunk had disappeared.
 Lin Jiufeng frowned and asked the little white cat, “Did you see that ancient tree just now?”
 “I saw it. I also saw a person sitting cross-legged under a tree, but he disappeared after I blinked,” the white cat replied.
 “What?” Lin Jiufeng looked at the little white cat in surprise.
 She saw an ancient tree and also a person sitting cross-legged under it?
 Even Lin Jiufeng didn’t see this person.
 “What’s wrong?” The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng, puzzled.
 “I didn’t see anyone sitting cross-legged. I only saw the ancient tree,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “This…” The white cat was surprised as she recalled carefully.
 “It’s a person, but there’s no shadow. It’s like a ghost,” the white cat said.
 “Can you still see it now?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “He’s not here anymore,” the white cat replied.
 “If not here, then where?” Lin Jiufeng’s expression was solemn.
 “Up ahead, that person is very, very far ahead.” The white cat stretched out its claws on Lin Jiufeng’s shoulder and pointed into the distance.
 “You can still see it?” Lin Jiufeng looked into the distance in surprise. He couldn’t see anything.
 “I don’t know why, but I can indeed see that that person’s expression is very sad. He seems to be crying. His face can’t be seen clearly, but I’m sure that it’s an old man,” the white cat said.
 “Point me the way, I’ll bring you and follow him,” Lin Jiufeng thought for a while and said.
 “Alright, hurry up. This person is very fast,” the white cat said anxiously.
 Lin Jiufeng increased his speed and advanced in the direction that the little white cat pointed.
 The little white cat kept pointing the way for Lin Jiufeng while Lin Jiufeng hurried in the direction she pointed.
 “Time has wiped out countless histories. The new world that was once painstakingly created by the heroes has ultimately been burned to ashes.” Suddenly, the little white cat said this sentence, causing Lin Jiufeng to look at her in surprise.
 “I didn’t say it, that person said it. I just repeated it.” The white cat explained.
 Lin Jiufeng frowned. What did this mean?
 The new world that the heroes fought so hard to create was destroyed by time!
 There were many deeper meanings in these words.
 “The ancient Chaos Tree. Can you tell me if immortals are everlasting?” The white cat continued.
 Lin Jiufeng knew that she was repeating the words of that mysterious person.
 “I once fought on the peak of the starry sky. I once killed a King of the ancient era. I once carved the stone tablet of the heroes in the Immortal Court!”
 “But I’m too old now.”
 “I’m going to die!”
 The white cat repeated the words one by one, making Lin Jiufeng’s heart jump.
 Fought on the peak of the starry sky and killed an ancient king, carving the stone tablet of the heroes in the Immortal Court.
 There was still an Immortal Court in this world?
 There was even an immortal’s world above the mortal world?
 To be honest, Lin Jiufeng had never believed in the so-called Immortal Ascension.
 The world that he thought of before was how the current world was like.
 But now, Lin Jiufeng knew of the existence of the Immortal Court from this person.
 But if this old man could carve the stone tablet in the Immortal Court, that meant that the Immortal Court wasn’t that powerful, right?
 Lin Jiufeng was confused. These were all his guesses, and there was no evidence. He abandoned his distracting thoughts and focused on following the little white cat’s pointers as he advanced.
 The white cat didn’t repeat anymore after the mysterious man said that he was going to die.
 The white cat continued to guide Lin Jiufeng forward, deeper into the black mountain.
 About two hours later, the white cat spoke again.
 “It’s a pity that those supreme powerhouses, existences that transcended the mortal world, ultimately still couldn’t withstand the invasion of time. Even though they looked down on the past and present, and were shockingly talented, in the end, they still returned to the dust and earth.” The white cat repeated this old man’s words.
 Lin Jiufeng was surprised.
 What did those supreme powerhouses, existences that transcended the mortal world refer to?
 “They reached the peak of the longevity that the people of the world seek. But even if they are world-shockingly powerful and look down on the world, in the end, they won’t be able to change anything.”
 “No matter how great a hero or how incredible their achievements, when everything is over, it will still be difficult to escape the final fate. They will ultimately decay and die.”
 “This is the same for me!”
 “I escaped the Great Quietus and killed the King of the Immortal Court, but now, I’m still following in their footsteps.”
 “Immortal Ascension, Immortal Court, but in the end, it turns out to be an illusory story!”
 “Mustn’t become an Immortal!”
 The white cat repeated the words one by one, making Lin Jiufeng’s heart jump. His expression was very solemn. These words seemed to be very serious.
 Mustn’t become an Immortal!
 These words were very serious.
 The people of the world were all seeking to become immortals, all of them wanting to reach this supreme status. But the old man in this mysterious place said one mustn’t become an Immortal.
 “What else did he say?” Lin Jiufeng asked the little white cat.
 “He didn’t continue. He’s just in front and didn’t continue forward,” the white cat whispered.
 Lin Jiufeng stopped in his tracks and looked in front of him. He realized that he had arrived at the only calm lake in the black mountain.
 The lake water was like a mirror. It was very beautiful, reflecting the huge black mountain.
 Previously, Lin Jiufeng had seen this lake at the entrance of the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. He didn’t expect that he would come here after chasing after the old man.
 “That old man planted that Chaos Tree,” the white cat pointed ahead and said softly.
 “How did you see all these? I can’t see anything.” Lin Jiufeng watched carefully. In any case, he couldn’t see anything.
 The lake water was still the same lake water. Everything around him was still the same.
 “Perhaps it’s because of my bloodline. My bloodline is different from yours.” The white cat guessed.
 “I can sign a contract with you. With this contract, you can also share my bloodline,” the white cat suddenly said.
 “What contract?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “Life and death contract!” The white cat said.
 “Once the contract is signed, we will live and die together,” the white cat said.
 “Signing this contract with me seems to be a disadvantage for you.” Lin Jiufeng frowned.
 The white cat smiled and said, “What loss did I suffer? You’re so powerful, much stronger than me. If you can’t die, then I can’t die either. Once we sign the agreement, we will be the closest person to each other in this life.”
 Actually, there was something the white cat didn’t say.
 The signing of a life and death contract depended on the will of the contractor.
 In other words, the original composition of the contract was that if the little white cat lived, Lin Jiufeng would live. But if the little white cat died, Lin Jiufeng would die too.
 The white cat didn’t tell him this.
 Instead, the white cat secretly changed this to if Lin Jiufeng lived, then she would live.
 “That old man is about to pass away. You won’t be able to see him if you don’t decide now.” The white cat urged Lin Jiufeng.
 “Let’s sign it.” Lin Jiufeng agreed.
 The white cat bit Lin Jiufeng’s neck, causing blood to flow out. Then, she licked the blood and absorbed it. Then, she crafted a contract in her divine soul.
 A life and death contract!
 At this moment, Lin Jiufeng’s soul trembled. There was an additional layer of shackles on him. He looked again. One side of the shackles was him, and the other was connected to the little white cat.
 In the middle of this contract was a beautiful diamond-shaped mark that connected Lin Jiufeng and the little white cat.
 “We really can’t part now.” The white cat smiled happily.
 Lin Jiufeng asked strangely, “To be honest, did you intentionally make me sign this contract?”
 The white cat ‘panicked’ and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? This contract is nothing much. You can see that old man now. Look at him carefully, don’t think about the contract anymore.”
 Lin Jiufeng’s attention was diverted. He looked over carefully. This time, he really saw the old man. Not just the old man, there was also the Chaos Tree from before that he fleetingly saw.
 The leaves of the Chaos Tree were colorful and bright, adding some other colors to the huge black mountain.
 This old man planted the Chao Tree by the lake and used the lake water to water it.
 Shuash!
 The lake water poured down and the Chaos Tree absorbed it. Its branches and leaves began to sway and make sounds. Different glows flickered, making the entire tree shine.
 This also illuminated the old man’s appearance. He was a rather handsome man, but because of his messy hair and the deep wrinkles, it could be seen that he wasn’t young.
 This kind of old wasn’t because of the passing of time, but because of exhaustion. He quickly aged in a short period of time. Otherwise, with his powerful strength, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to remain young.
 “The Chaos Tree has already been planted. It will bloom and bear fruit one day in the future. I have also reached the end of my life, about to disintegrate.” The old man let out a long breath as if he had been released from some burden. He wasn’t afraid at all, nor was he worried.
 “I won’t be able to hide from this time’s catastrophe. Let the future of this world be shouldered by the people of the future. But I wonder if a new Savior will be born after the Heavenly Dao Sect loses me.” The old man murmured softly. His words made Lin Jiufeng raise his head in surprise.
 This old man was a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect!
 Was it the same Heavenly Dao Sect that Miss Hong was in?
 The white cat watched in surprise too.
 “I wonder how many years ago this old man existed here. But because he was too powerful, the huge black mountain and the Great Dao of the world imprinted the traces of his existence here, resulting in the scene that we are seeing now.” Lin Jiufeng said to himself. He observed that the time period in which the old man existed was different from the current time period.
 “His time period was that of the past,” the white cat said.
 Then, they looked at the old man again. After planting the Chaos Tree, he sat cross-legged under the tree. Then, his body became covered in light and started to disintegrate. The light of the Immortal Path was very dazzling, resplendent, and captivating.
 Rumble!
 At this moment, all sorts of small cauldrons, array formations, eight trigrams, divine bells, immortal phoenixes, and dragon sparrows appeared around the old man. Each of them represented a peerless immortal technique and also represented his Dao Fruit.
 Lin Jiufeng remembered these things in his eyes and didn’t dare to miss out on them at all. These were the things that he would be comprehending next. After comprehending these, he could also transcend the second lightning tribulation.
 Right now, Lin Jiufeng was at the peak of the Opening of the Three Flowers stage. If he were to undergo the tribulation again, he would reach the Forming of the Five Energies stage.
 Hence, this could be considered an opportunity.
 When the old man completely disintegrated, all his Daoist techniques and cultivation techniques were absorbed by the Chaos Tree at this moment.
 Then, before the old man’s figure completely disappeared, he opened his hand at the last moment and placed a secret manual of the Heavenly Dao Sect under the Chaos Tree.
 Lin Jiufeng could clearly see the secret manual of the Heavenly Dao Sect buried under the Chaos Tree.
 At the last moment, the old man chose to disintegrate silently.
 Lin Jiufeng could see clearly that before the old man’s corpse fully disintegrated, it was already covered in injuries. The scars from countless years of battle covered his bones, his Great Dao, and his immortal spells.
 All of these added up was the reason why he died.
 After the old man disintegrated, these images of the past slowly disappeared. Even the little white cat couldn’t see it anymore.
 “It has ended,” the white cat said.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the location where the old man planted the Chaos Tree.
 The place was empty now.
 It was unknown if the Chaos Tree was dead or taken away.
 But Lin Jiufeng wanted to give it a try. Was the secret manual of the Heavenly Dao Sect that was buried by the old man at the last moment still there?
 He walked forward and lifted the huge rock away. Then, he dug down for a while, and a huge pit appeared.
 In the pit was a sheepskin book.
 “This is actually still here,” the white cat said in surprise. This wasn’t simple.
 Lin Jiufeng asked curiously, “This is still here, then what about the Chaos Tree?”
 “It might have escaped on its own.” The white cat guessed.
 Lin Jiufeng thought for a while and nodded. “That makes sense!”
 This indeed made sense. The Chaos Tree wasn’t simple. From the way the old man treated it at the end, it was obvious how precious it was.
 Lin Jiufeng took out the secret manual of the Heavenly Dao Sect and flipped it open. The words inside appeared before his eyes.
 But…
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t recognize a single word.
 “It’s completely different from the current words.” The white cat leaned forward and said in surprise.
 Yes.
 The words were completely different from the current ones. They were curved and crooked, like tadpoles swimming around. Lin Jiufeng had read many ancient books, but there were no records of such words.
 “To be able to change the writings of an era without leaving any traces, this isn’t something that can be done in a short period of time. It has to be at least tens of thousands of years old.” Lin Jiufeng muttered to himself and put away the secret manual of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 “What do you plan to do now?” The white cat asked.
 “Find someone who might know this secret manual,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “Miss Hong?” The white cat could only think of this person.
 “Yes, she’s a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Heavenly Dao Sect has been passed down till now, she should know these words.” Lin Jiufeng nodded and got up to leave.
 But after taking a few steps, a line of words appeared before his eyes.
 [Do you want to Sign-In at the Undying Mountain?]
 Lin Jiufeng raised his brows. The first thing he paid attention to was the words ‘Undying Mountain’.
 Was this huge, black mountain range that existed in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy the Undying Mountain?
 The name Undying Mountain sounded very domineering.
 But Lin Jiufeng still didn’t know what use this mountain had.
 He didn’t understand this place fully yet, nor did he investigate it thoroughly.
 “Sign in!” Lin Jiufeng agreed first.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t care about the rest for now. If he didn’t figure it out now, he would just come back in the future. After all, Lin Jiufeng had plenty of time.
 The most important thing now was to find Miss Hong and obtain the secret of this secret manual.
 Food had to be eaten bite by bite.
 One step at a time.
 [Sign-In successful. Received a copy of the Undying Secret Technique!]
 Lin Jiufeng closed his eyes and accepted all the memories of this cultivation technique.
 This was a cultivation technique similar to [See Immortality in the Cycle of Reincarnation].
 But the difference was that the Undying Secret Technique didn’t need the user to be killed or to be executed. It could extend one’s life indefinitely, and one would only be killed when one’s source energy was used up.
 Lin Jiufeng carefully matched the two powerful cultivation techniques together.
 He suddenly discovered something in surprise.
 It would be difficult for him to die even if he wanted to.
 ‘The Undying Secret Technique can make it difficult for me to be killed and can extend my life indefinitely. Even if my source energy is depleted and the Undying Secret Technique can’t save me, I can just execute See Immortality in the Cycle of Reincarnation after I get killed. I will directly revive and repeat the process over and over again.’ Lin Jiufeng thought in surprise.
 This discovery surprised him.
 These two cultivation techniques didn’t seem to be like treasure skills or immortal techniques that were too terrifying.
 Together, they definitely fixed Lin Jiufeng’s bottom line in battle.
 If he maintained this frequency, it would be very difficult for him to be killed even if he wanted to.
 Unless he was killed four times in a row like Bai Tiandi and had no choice but to surrender.
 Bai Tiandi could only execute See Immortality in the Cycle of Reincarnation a few times. If he executed it too much, he would really become lost in the cycle of reincarnation, unable to extricate himself from it, never to return again.
 Lin Jiufeng also had this kind of risk, but he was slightly better than Bai Tiandi, he could use it a few more times. Therefore, this kind of life-extending technique couldn’t continue forever, but if others wanted to kill Lin Jiufeng, they had to kill him at least seven or eight times, or even nine times in a row.
 ‘Why have I become like the little white cat? I have nine lives now?’ Lin Jiufeng looked at the little white cat in surprise.
 “Why are you looking at me like that?” The white cat asked, puzzled.
 “I’m thinking, if I drown you, will you have another eight lives to live?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng speechlessly.
 “I’m kidding. You are so cute and beautiful, how can I bear to drown you? Now, come with me to find Miss Hong,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “Aren’t you going to continue exploring the Land of Extremely Negative Energy?”
 “I feel that if we continue exploring, we will discover something new,” the white cat said.
 “It’s okay. The Land of Extremely Negative Energy is right here. There’s the [Light of the Homes] suppressing it, no one can discover it. We can come down at any time. But now, we have to find Miss Hong and solve the secret of this book,” Lin Jiufeng explained.
 Lin Jiufeng really wanted to know who that old man was.
 He also wanted to know the origins of that old man.
 He also wanted to know what the old man meant by ‘mustn’t become an Immortal’.
 Lin Jiufeng wanted to know all these.
 And the only person who could solve his doubts was Miss Hong.
 “Do you know where Miss Hong is?” The white cat asked.
 The last time they met was in the Northwest Territory. They parted in the oasis of the Mountain Sea Realm. Miss Hong left sadly and never appeared again. Her whereabouts had also become a mystery.
 “I roughly know where she is.” Lin Jiufeng thought carefully and confirmed a place.
 “How do you know where she is?” The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng suspiciously.
 “She’s in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. She’s sealing that world that’s about to appear. She’s also waiting for me to go over,” Lin Jiufeng said firmly.

                    



 Chapter 247: Elder Universe  
 Lin Jiufeng knew that Miss Hong really wanted to see other people of the Heavenly Dao Sect appear in this world.
 In this world, she was the only one who had appeared. The teacher-master, uncle-masters, senior brothers, and sisters of the previous era had all disappeared in the forgotten world.
 ?
 Although they used the word ‘disappear’, Lin Jiufeng had heard from Bai Tiandi and the others.
 In that forgotten world, before Elder Mountain Sea achieved the Dao, he fought with a group of mysterious people. After killing them, he integrated all the source energy of the forgotten world and broke through to the False Immortal Realm.
 This might be the outcome of the people from the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 Because in the forgotten world, the powerhouses inside all knew each other. Only this group of mysterious people wasn’t people Bai Tiandi and Old Man Luo knew. It was as if they appeared out of thin air.
 According to Miss Hong, at the end of the previous era, the powerhouses of the Heavenly Dao Sect fought with a False Immortal and entered the forgotten world. Then, everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect went to reinforce this powerhouse, leaving Miss Hong behind. As for Miss Hong, she entered a sealed state until this era.
 Miss Hong thought that when the time came, the people of the Heavenly Dao Sect would reappear. Therefore, she tried her best to suppress the world at the beginning, preventing those people who wanted to recover in advance from having the chance to do so.
 But as time passed, her heart gradually became disappointed. Moreover, the people who had recovered were becoming stronger and stronger. She couldn’t suppress them alone anymore, so she didn’t continue. Instead, she entered the Northwest Territory, the Mountain Sea Realm, wanting to find the people of the Heavenly Dao Sect and suppress the powerhouses of the previous era together.
 But reality struck her hard.
 Till now, she had already started to pass down the Heavenly Dao Sect’s legacy and continued to use her meager strength to protect this world.
 She was now in the Hundred Thousand Mountains and guarding the entrance of the forgotten world there.
 Lin Jiufeng walked out of the Land of Extremely Negative Energy and turned his head to look. In the Land of Extremely Negative Energy, in the Undying Mountains, there were black mountains with a majestic aura. From afar, they were shrouded in fog and looked extremely mysterious.
 There were many secrets in the Undying Mountains.
 Every mountain in the Undying Mountains was the king and emperor of the mountains. Each of them was difficult to find in the world and was filled with oppression. Just the aura of some of these mountains could already completely suppress a person.
 This was quite terrifying.
 “When I figure out the identity of this mysterious person, I will come back to explore the secrets here.” Lin Jiufeng said to himself. Then, he left without looking back.
 After exiting the Land of Extremely Negative Energy and returning to the Cold Palace, the sky had already darkened.
 There was no change in the outside world at all. The eyes of the people of the world were still on the Kunlun Mountains and Princess Yulin.
 The Hundred Races in the Kunlun Mountains were suppressed by the Painting of the People and didn’t dare to act recklessly. Princess Yulin kept an eye on them. As long as the Kunlun Mountains didn’t act recklessly, the Yuhua God Dynasty would remain quiet and continue to develop itself.
 Such as improving the lives of the common people, investing in education, increasing the number of teachers in the Martial Temple, establishing more branches everywhere, and letting more children enroll in the schools for free. The children taught in the early years had also grown up. They were capable enough to become teachers and inherit the teaching of the Martial Temple to the next generations.
 It had been decades since the Martial Temple was established. During this period, generations of students had been groomed. Some joined the society, some joined the army, and some chose to be teachers. They became the cornerstones of the Yuhua God Dynasty and would become a powerful pillar of the Yuhua God Dynasty in the future.
 Because of this, the potential of the Yuhua God Dynasty in the future would be boundless.
 The world was stable. Lin Jiufeng silently left the Yuhua God Dynasty and headed for the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 The Hundred Thousand Mountains was logically also the territory of the Yuhua God Dynasty. But in order to stabilize the monster race and prevent conflicts from erupting, the Yuhua God Dynasty partitioned the Hundred Thousand Mountains to the monster race as a foothold.
 In the Hundred Thousand Mountains, no matter what the monster race did, it was their own business and had nothing to do with the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 As long as they didn’t offend the Yuhua God Dynasty, the Yuhua God Dynasty wouldn’t bother them.
 The current rulers of the Hundred Thousand Mountains were the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race. Each of them knew how terrifying Lin Jiufeng was and knew that the Yuhua God Dynasty wasn’t to be trifled with. Therefore, after taking over the Hundred Thousand Mountains, they had always kept a low profile.
 They quietly recovered their strength and then nurtured the power of the monster race to let more monster powerhouses recover.
 Compared to the occasional commotion in other places, the Hundred Thousand Mountains really didn’t create any problems at all. It was so quiet that the people of the world almost forgot about this place.
 This was also the development strategy formulated by the Seven Great Sages. They wanted to accumulate their strength in a low-key manner.
 But a huge change had happened to the Hundred Thousand Mountains. The Seven Great Sages also knew about this. Different from Miss Hong, they were very excited and had always wanted to open the forgotten world there.
 The Hundred Thousand Mountains had always been the territory of the monster race since ancient times. The fact that a forgotten world could appear here was enough to prove that this forgotten world was deeply related to the monster race.
 It was very likely that there were seniors of the monster race inside.
 In the territory of the monster race, the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race were gathered together. Some had serious expressions, some looked angry, and some had cold faces. They were all angry.
 “That woman is going too far. The emergence of that forgotten world is the matter of the monster race of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, but she wants to interfere and forcefully stop the forgotten world from coming into being. She’s simply despicable!” Demon King Jiao, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, shouted angrily. His eyes looked at a huge mountain in the distance. He was indignant and there was anger in his eyes.
 Demon King Dapeng spurted out a white depressed aura and said angrily, “That woman is a busybody. If it weren’t for the fact that she’s skilled in the divine runes and has set up countless array formations to stop us, she would have died long ago.”
 “There are various killing array formations on that huge mountain. We tried to charge through them a few times, but we were unable to break through. The killing array formations are connected to the earth’s veins, and with just a slight movement, the force of the entire heaven and earth will be used against us. We couldn’t break through before,” Demon King Pingtian said.
 “But now, that might not be the case anymore.” Demon King Pingtian shouted. His hooves stepped on the air, his aura incomparable.
 The peak of the Void Returning Realm!
 That was his current strength.
 It wasn’t just him. The other six demons had also diligently cultivated and recovered their strength during this period of time, returning their condition to a certain extent.
 Although they hadn’t reached their peak strength, which was the False Immortal Realm, they couldn’t be underestimated.
 Seven peak Void Returning Realm cultivators were the top existences in any faction. At this moment, they were gathered together because they wanted to open up this forgotten world.
 At the same time, they wanted to kill Miss Hong to take revenge for the depressed feelings they had all these years.
 Miss Hong was the first to discover this forgotten world. Then, she began to set up backup plans. All sorts of killing arrays were set up one after another, becoming one with heaven and earth. It was very terrifying. After these were set up, Miss Hong fetched the people of the Heavenly Dao Sect here. She suppressed the forgotten world here while teaching the children who were fated with the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 This had been the situation until now.
 Then, the Seven Great Sages discovered the forgotten world.
 But they were already a step behind. They wanted to barge in forcefully, but they were blocked by Miss Hong’s killing arrays. The experience of the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race over the years was simply a history of blood and tears.
 In order to enter the array formation and confront Miss Hong and open up this forgotten world, they forcefully resisted the killing arrays and kept going deeper into the killing arrays.
 While doing so, the killing arrays attacked them unscrupulously. It was only because their skin was rough and their flesh was thick that they could endure being struck again and again. But the pain was unbearable, and their angry roars reverberated throughout the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 But for the sake of that forgotten world, they still gritted their teeth and persevered.
 But who knew that Miss Hong was still constantly setting up killing array formations? Those array formations were one loop after another. She directly set them up hundreds of them and tortured the Seven Great Sages until they were a tragic sight.
 If it were anyone else, they would have died countless times already.
 Hence, the Seven Great Sages’ hatred for Miss Hong was simply indescribable.
 This time, they had all recovered to the peak of the Void Returning Realm. They were naturally filled with confidence as they stared at the majestic mountain with excited looks in their eyes.
 The killing arrays that had tortured them for all these years were definitely useless this time.
 “Let’s go!”
 Demon King Jiao, Demon King Dapeng, Demon King Gui, Demon King Yuan, Bai Zilong, Yun Shanhai, and Demon King Pingtian.
 The auras of the seven sages were aggressive. They used various means and entered the majestic mountain.
 This mountain was originally not very conspicuous in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. The Hundred Thousand Mountains lacked everything except for mountains. Each mountain was very majestic and was the territory of the monster race. The trees were lush, vines entangled, and strange stones were everywhere.
 In this mountain, there were many golden patterns carved on the mountain. Those were divine runes that the Heavenly Dao Sect comprehended according to the Great Dao patterns of the world.
 These divine runes were very powerful.
 Boom!
 The Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race rushed over together. Their speeds were very fast, and they soon alarmed the divine runes.
 Buzz!
 The divine runes trembled and floated up. They erupted with a myriad of lights that transformed into a huge bell. With a slight tremble, the bell transformed into ripples that cleansed the surroundings. It was extremely terrifying.
 Buzz!
 The entire void trembled violently. The aura of the Great Dao spread out between heaven and earth, shocking the surroundings. But at this moment, the auras of the Seven Great Sages also spread out.
 Dang!
 In front, the auras of the Seven Great Sages collided with this huge bell. There was no so-called landslide or tsunami, only a tremor in the surrounding space.
 But this tremor released a terrifying sound wave as if it wanted to destroy this world. It was like a white wave that covered the mountain.
 Rumble!
 At this moment, countless divine runes surged in the mountains, producing ripples. It was extremely terrifying. The countless array formations were revealed. Each array formation was looped to another one.
 “These array formations of yours have stopped us for all these years, but now, they can no longer do so.” The Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao, roared. He transformed into his true form and his huge tail swept over, crashing into the array formations in an extremely terrifying manner.
 Crack!
 The strength of the peak of the Void Returning Realm gave Demon King Jiao a lot of confidence. With this collision, the array formations constructed by the divine runes trembled and cracks appeared.
 Seeing these cracks, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao, laughed out loud. “All these years, I’ve been tortured by these array formations. Today, I will smash these things into pieces. The girl inside, you will definitely die this time!”
 It wasn’t just Demon King Jiao who was so excited. The rest of the Seven Great Sages were also very excited. One by one, they rushed over and executed powerful cultivation techniques to smash the array formations.
 Rumble!
 Deep in the mountains, Miss Hong listened to the rumbling with a serious expression. The array formations that she had set up over the years couldn’t hold on anymore.
 The Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race recovered their strength too quickly.
 “It seems that I won’t be able to continue suppressing this forgotten world,” Miss Hong said helplessly.
 Behind her was a huge black hole. A terrifying aura was spreading from the black hole. There were huge-sized monsters and strange and unfathomable demons inside. Fortunately, Miss Hong used the secret technique of the Heavenly Dao Sect to seal this exit. Otherwise, they would have long come out.
 There were the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race in front and then there were the group of demons in the forgotten world behind her.
 It wasn’t easy for Miss Hong to persevere for the past few years.
 But she had no complaints. This was originally the responsibility of the Heavenly Dao Sect. As a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect, she had seen too many seniors of her sect do this in the previous era, so she was doing the same now.
 It was passed down from generation to generation, and this legacy had never ceased. But this was as much as she could do now.
 “It’s a pity that my personal strength is still too weak. Even though I have already reached the Void Returning Realm, there’s still a huge gap between me and a true powerhouse. If I had the strength of the peak of the Void Returning Realm now, the might of these divine runes and the killing arrays would definitely increase by ten or a hundred times. In that case, the Seven Great Sages wouldn’t be able to destroy the array formations so easily like now.” Miss Hong sighed.
 She stood on the mountain peak. Dressed in red, her face was beautiful and peerless.
 Watching the killing array formations in front of her collapse one by one, Miss Hong was helpless. She was already at her wit’s end. She had used all that she had learned in her life to stop the Seven Great Sages for the past few years. This was already an incredible feat.
 “Fortunately, I sent away the disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect in advance. They brought the legacy of the Heavenly Dao Sect with them. With them around, the Heavenly Dao Sect wouldn’t be wiped out. Even if I die now, it will be a meaningful death.” Miss Hong wasn’t afraid. Instead, she was a little relieved.
 Just like her master, uncle-masters, senior brothers, and senior sisters, they were willing to die for the mission of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 Over the years, Miss Hong had slowly accepted that all the people she was familiar with had already died.
 Now, she was also walking on this path.
 Boom!
 In the very next moment, the final killing array was broken through by the Seven Great Sages. A surging demonic aura filled the air as they rushed over. In the demonic aura, the Seven Great Sages that were huge in size stared at Miss Hong in an extremely terrifying manner.
 Roar!
 A furious roar came from Demon King Jiao. His body twisted as he vented the depression in his heart at Miss Hong.
 “Woman, who exactly are you? Why have you stopped us for all these years?” Demon King Pingtian asked in a rather low voice.
 The Seven Great Sages glared at Miss Hong. They had really been tortured miserably by the killing arrays that Miss Hong had set up all these years.
 “Heavenly Dao Sect, Miss Hong!” Miss Hong introduced herself calmly.
 “Member of the Heavenly Dao Sect!” The Seven Great Sages exclaimed. They were also from the previous era, so they naturally knew about the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 “The people of the Heavenly Dao Sect are people who follow the Heavenly Dao. They are very mysterious, and no one knows what they are doing. I heard of the great name of this sect in the previous era, but I didn’t expect that I would only come into contact with you guys in this world,” the Great Sage of the Moving Mountain, Demon King Gui, said.
 “But even if you are a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect, you must die today,” Demon King Dapeng bellowed coldly.
 “Yes, you are stopping the revival of the monster race. In this forgotten space, there are many seniors of the monster race inside. They are the hope of the monster race’s revival. You actually dare to stop them from coming out all these years?” Demon King Yuan waved the rod in his hand, his eyes vicious.
 “A forgotten space shouldn’t appear when the spiritual energy is still weak. The current world isn’t yet the time for them to appear. I sealed them for the past few years because I followed the guidance of the Heavenly Dao,” Miss Hong said calmly.
 “But even the Ancient Kunlun Mountains have appeared. Yet, you’re telling me that seniors of the monster race are not allowed to appear in the world today?” The Great Sage of the Dreaming, Yun Shanhai, sneered.
 “That’s because someone in the current era woke up the Ancient Kunlun Mountains. Otherwise, the Ancient Kunlun Mountains wouldn’t have appeared so soon,” Miss Hong said faintly.
 She sensed from the Heavenly Dao that the recovery of spiritual energy in this era was far greater than in the previous eras.
 In the past, the recovery of spiritual energy in each era required several generations to reach the peak. But in this era, it had only been a hundred years, yet a False Immortal Realm cultivator had already appeared. It was really unbelievably fast.
 Ultimately, it was because of Lin Jiufeng’s existence.
 This era of spiritual energy recovery was complementary to Lin Jiufeng’s cultivation speed.
 Because of the recovery of the spiritual energy, Lin Jiufeng quickly broke through and entered the False Immortal Realm.
 It was also because Lin Jiufeng had broken through to the False Immortal Realm that various forgotten worlds appeared.
 The False Immortals in these forgotten worlds then appeared in this world.
 Because of Lin Jiufeng, the spiritual energy that could only be recovered to its peak in the past few generations had now shortened to a single generation.
 It was normal for the others in this world to be unable to keep up.
 The Seven Great Sages sneered at Miss Hong’s words. They didn’t believe her at all.
 “No matter how much you say today, it won’t change your outcome. This green mountain is your burial place!” The Great Sage of the White Clothed, Bai Zilong, said coldly.
 Miss Hong stared at the Seven Great Sages and said, “The moment I became a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect, I had already prepared for this outcome. There’s no need to scare me.”
 “Release the seal. I will leave you an intact corpse and give you some dignity. We won’t humiliate you.” The Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao, transformed into human form. He took a step forward, and his aura was like a violent wind that blew up Miss Hong’s clothes. They fluttered in the wind, her hair danced, and her expression was solemn.
 It was a little difficult for her to withstand the strength of a peak Void Returning Realm cultivator.
 “This seal can still be maintained for at least another year. This is the Heavenly Dao Sect’s supreme secret technique. You guys won’t be able to break it.” Miss Hong shook her head firmly and rejected this request.
 The Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race were unable to restrain their anger. Demon King Yuan glared at Miss Hong angrily. He raised the long rod fiercely and directly smashed it down from afar towards the seal.
 Boom!
 The long rod was made of rare divine stones, and it already had the strength of 150,000 kilograms. In addition to his violent force, it landed on the mysterious seal. Extremely terrifying ripples surged, spreading in all directions.
 This sound reverberated in the surroundings. The other six demons watched closely.
 But in the very next moment, Demon King Yuan was directly sent flying. He couldn’t resist at all. His blood and vital energy surged, and his monkey face was redder than a monkey’s butt. He bared his teeth, and his wrist trembled as he looked at the other six demons and shook his head.
 “I can’t break it. This isn’t something that can be broken with our current cultivation realm.” Demon King Yuan gritted his teeth.
 A trident appeared in the hand of the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao. He directly pressed it against Miss Hong’s neck and shouted angrily, “Undo the seal, or I will kill you right now.”
 “As I said, this seal will automatically dissipate a year later. When the time comes, the seal will naturally be unsealed,” Miss Hong said coldly.
 “A year later, it will be too late. Let’s not talk about other places, but the Kunlun Mountains have already appeared. The monster race must be one step ahead, not fall behind step by step!” Demon King Jiao, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, said through gritted teeth.
 He hated her so much that he really wanted to stab her to death.
 But they really had no solution for this seal.
 “This is the sealing array formation that I was constantly setting up over the past few years and only completed yesterday. Since you guys want to break it forcefully, then do whatever you want. Of course, with your current strength, you guys are still not strong enough. Only someone of the False Immortal Realm could break this seal. What’s more, not just any False Immortal can break this seal, only those powerful ones. Therefore, you guys can go and ask that mysterious False Immortal Realm powerhouse from the Yuhua God Dynasty. He should be able to break this seal!” Miss Hong smiled and said.
 “Are you really not afraid of death?” Demon King Yuan couldn’t help but raise his rod.
 “It’s just death. It’s something that everyone has to face. If you kill me, I will be able to get rid of this stinky body. My soul will soar into the heavens and I will go to the side of the Heavenly Dao to accompany it.” Miss Hong was fearless.
 This infuriated the Seven Great Sages.
 “Fine, then I’ll kill you and go beg that False Immortal powerhouse of the Yuhua God Dynasty. In any case, the Heaven Raising Bull has a pretty good relationship with him.” Demon King Jiao, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, was unable to restrain his anger. He directly raised his trident and was about to strike.
 Demon King Pingtian’s expression stiffened. He had a good relationship with Lin Jiufeng?
 What an international joke.
 In front of Lin Jiufeng, he didn’t dare to be impudent at all, okay?
 “Die!” Demon King Jiao waved the trident ruthlessly and directly inserted it towards Miss Hong’s chest.
 Miss Hong closed her eyes and her mood relaxed. She could go and find her teacher-master, uncle-masters, senior brothers, and senior sisters in the heavens now.
 Clang!
 But in the very next moment, the space was sealed.
 Demon King Jiao’s trident was only a finger’s distance away from Miss Hong’s body, but it couldn’t approach her anymore. His face turned red as he watched in surprise and anger. He wanted to retreat, but the surrounding space seemed to have frozen. It was as if he had fallen into a swamp and was deep inside, unable to extricate himself.
 It wasn’t just him. The other six demons were the same.
 All of them roared in their hearts and struggled with all their might, but it was still useless. They couldn’t break free.
 Miss Hong watched in surprise. The wind was blowing in the distant mountains, the leaves in the distant mountains were swaying, and the white clouds in the blue sky were wandering and changing. Everything was so beautiful.
 Only this area froze. No one could move.
 At this moment, Miss Hong’s eyes suddenly widened. She saw a person walking over from the void. He was dressed in white and looked handsome. He stretched out a white, slender finger and flicked it gently.
 Clang!
 This strike struck Demon King Jiao’s trident. It was neither light nor heavy, but it flicked the trident away. It also made Demon King Jiao vomit large mouthfuls of blood as his body flew out.
 At this moment, the surrounding space returned to its original state. Everyone could move now.
 Demon King Pingtian said in horror, “The Yuhua God Dynasty’s False Immortal!”
 “Why are you here?” Demon King Jiao was even more afraid. He couldn’t care less about his injuries and asked in shock.
 The faces of the other demons turned serious. They simultaneously retreated and distanced themselves. If they were too close, they would feel insecure.
 Although they knew in their hearts that even if they were far away, it was still easy for Lin Jiufeng to kill them if he wanted to, the psychological effect wasn’t that obvious. There was no need to be so scared that their legs went soft.
 “Why can’t I come here?” Lin Jiufeng asked instead, looking at Demon King Jiao expressionlessly.
 If Miss Hong was almost killed by Demon King Jiao, his plan would have been completely spoiled. Lin Jiufeng couldn’t help but be glad that he didn’t stay in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy for too long. Otherwise, he wouldn’t know who that mysterious old man was.
 Now, there was only Miss Hong left from the Heavenly Dao Sect of the previous era. If Miss Hong died, it would really become a mystery.
 “Senior, I was wrong. I’m sorry.” Demon King Jiao was also decisive. He ignored his injuries and directly apologized. His attitude was very sincere. He was very worried that Lin Jiufeng would seal him for decades again.
 In this era where spiritual energy changed crazily every day, if he was really sealed for decades, Demon King Jiao would go crazy.
 Hence, he apologized sincerely.
 It wasn’t just Demon King Jiao. The other six demons simultaneously bowed to Lin Jiufeng.
 “Senior, we were wrong!”
 This shout was very decisive. Lin Jiufeng watched, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. His face twitched.
 Miss Hong smiled and said, “You are indeed a famous figure of this era. Once you appeared, their arrogant and despotic attitude from before disappeared. They are as obedient as a rabbit now.”
 She wasn’t too excited about escaping death, but she was excited to see Lin Jiufeng.
 Since Lin Jiufeng took the initiative to look for her, there must be a reason. Was it related to the Heavenly Dao Sect?
 Miss Hong secretly looked forward to it.
 After Demon King Jiao apologized, he bowed and didn’t dare to raise his head. He could only secretly look at Lin Jiufeng, his heart in his throat.
 If Lin Jiufeng was angry, the seven of them combined wouldn’t be a match for him.
 Not to mention anything else, the Seven Great Sages knew very well what had happened in the Kunlun Mountains.
 They unanimously agreed that Lin Jiufeng was the culprit. The most powerful person in the Yuhua God Dynasty was Lin Jiufeng.
 “Get lost. This forgotten world will appear again in a year. During this period, you are not allowed to have any crooked thoughts. Otherwise, I will seal you lot for 100 years!” Lin Jiufeng said coldly.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t kill the Seven Great Sages because he wanted to communicate with Miss Hong as soon as possible.
 The Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race ran faster than anyone else. It was as if Lin Jiufeng was some ferocious beast that they were afraid to even see.
 On the peak of the mountain, the Seven Great Sages instantly disappeared, leaving only Miss Hong and Lin Jiufeng.
 “Did you come to look for me because you have news about the Heavenly Dao Sect?” Miss Hong asked Lin Jiufeng expectantly.
 Lin Jiufeng turned around and nodded slightly.
 “Really?” Miss Hong was overjoyed.
 “Yes, but it’s not what you think,” Lin Jiufeng said softly.
 Miss Hong was thinking about her master, uncle-master, senior brothers, and senior sisters.
 But the news that Lin Jiufeng brought was the news of the ancestor of the Heavenly Dao Sect, an old man from who knew how many years ago.
 This was far from what Miss Hong was expecting.
 Hence, it wasn’t a good thing for Miss Hong to be too excited. The greater her expectations were, the greater her disappointment would be.
 Hearing Lin Jiufeng’s words, Miss Hong’s face instantly dimmed. She took a deep breath and said, “Tell me, I’ve calmed down.”
 “Have a look at this book.” Lin Jiufeng took out the sheepskin book and handed it to Miss Hong.
 Miss Hong received it suspiciously and asked, “What is this?”
 “It’s a secret manual of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but I don’t understand what’s written on it,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “A secret manual of my Heavenly Dao Sect?” Miss Hong opened the book in confusion. Upon first sight of the words, it already made her eyelids twitch.
 “These are words from 18,000 years ago,” Miss Hong said in surprise.
 “18,000 years ago?” Lin Jiufeng was also very surprised. He originally thought that it was words from tens of thousands of years ago, but he didn’t expect that it was only 18,000 years.
 “Yes, these words are only used by a small number of people. I heard from my master that these are words that only a specific small race uses. It’s normal that the general public doesn’t know about them. How did you obtain this?” Miss Hong asked Lin Jiufeng.
 The wind on the mountain peak was very strong, blowing up Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong’s clothes. He pondered for a while and told them about the mysterious old man.
 Of course, Lin Jiufeng didn’t mention the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. He only said that he discovered a mysterious black mountain called the Undying Mountain. In the Undying Mountain, he saw an old man. He discovered the trace that this old man had left behind many years ago and then found this secret manual.
 “I need to check the information of the Heavenly Dao Sect. Very few people know these words. Since the old man you mentioned self-proclaimed to be a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect, he must be a senior of the Heavenly Dao Sect. I must figure this out this time,” Miss Hong said firmly. Hope burst out in her eyes. Although there was no news of her Teacher-Master or Uncle-Master, this was still good news.
 After saying this, Miss Hong left the mountain with Lin Jiufeng.
 She had already let her disciples take everything from the Heavenly Dao Sect away.  As she had to finish the sealing array formation, Miss Hong already made preparations to retreat upon completing the seal. She only completed it yesterday, but it was too late for her to leave. Therefore, she got her disciple to take everything in the Heavenly Dao Sect and escape in advance. She wanted to preserve the seed of fire of the Heavenly Dao while she gave up her life to do what was right.
 But she didn’t expect Lin Jiufeng’s arrival to save her and bring such important news.
 Hence, Miss Hong brought Lin Jiufeng to look for the disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 Lin Jiufeng followed Miss Hong and they advanced at a rapid pace. Soon, they arrived at the address that she had chosen for the disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 It was still in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. The difference was that it was very remote, but it was safe and could protect the other members of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 “The Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race joined forces with the other monsters in the Hundred Thousand Mountains to guard the surroundings. My disciples couldn’t escape, so I chose a place inside the Hundred Thousand Mountains. I set up a concealment array formation to ensure that they are fine. After I die, the defense of the Hundred Thousand Mountains will slacken and they will be able to escape.” Miss Hong told Lin Jiufeng her arrangements on the way.
 She was very meticulous. She even arranged the steps for after she died.
 “Actually, you can give up on guarding that forgotten world,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “No, that’s absolutely impossible to happen. I’m a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect. This is the responsibility of the members of the Heavenly Dao Sect. My teacher-master, uncle-masters, senior brothers, and senior sisters have all gone missing because of this. I won’t give up either.” Miss Hong shook her head with a firm attitude.
 “Even if it’s just to seal that forgotten world for a year, I will still do it. This is my mission, I won’t hesitate to do it with my life as the price.” Miss Hong walked in front and said firmly.
 Lin Jiufeng stopped talking. He admired Miss Hong’s firm choice.
 Arriving at the hidden mountain peak, Miss Hong opened the concealment array formation. Seeing her, her disciples cheered. Their sadness was wiped away.
 Their beautiful teacher-master wasn’t dead yet.
 After calming them down, Miss Hong brought Lin Jiufeng into a secret chamber. This was a space that was specially created. The outside didn’t look big, but upon entering, one could see a completely different space. Inside were books that had been accumulated by the generations of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 It was a vast space with countless bookshelves, one couldn’t see the end of it.
 The books here were definitely the most that Lin Jiufeng had ever seen. They were even more than the royal library of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Miss Hong found the book she wanted with ease. Then, she opened the sheepskin book and translated it carefully. The more she read, the more her heart pounded.
 Her expression changed constantly. She was surprised and happy, but she was also sad.
 After Lin Jiufeng saw this, he asked, “What is recorded inside?”
 “This is the Heavenly Dao Sect’s supreme secret technique, the Universe Clock!” Miss Hong raised her head and said in surprise.
 “This is a mystic technique that even immortals covet. It comes from the former Elder Universe, who is also an old senior of the Heavenly Dao Sect,” Miss Hong continued.
 “As for this Elder Universe, he existed 20,000 years ago. The last bit of records is very clear. He killed his way into the Immortal Court and buried the Immortal Spirits, Gods, and the Immortal Court of the old era!” Miss Hong said word by word.
 After hearing this, Lin Jiufeng looked at Miss Hong, surprised.

                    



 Chapter 248: The Era of Immortals  
 He killed his way into the Immortal Court and buried the Immortal Spirits, Gods, and the Immortal Court of the old era.
 This was the record that Elder Universe left behind in the Heavenly Dao Sect. These few simple words revealed a lot of information.
 ?
 “Is there really an Immortal Court in this world?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “It is said that 20,000 years ago, a mysterious organization was hidden in the sky above us, which was the Immortal Court,” Miss Hong said.
 “Is the cultivation towards becoming immortal really the only path?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “I don’t know.” Miss Hong couldn’t give an answer, nor did she know.
 “Perhaps there are records in the books here, but I’m not sure. No senior ever told me about this before.” Miss Hong sighed.
 She knew nothing about Lin Jiufeng’s doubts.
 “Other than that, is there any other news?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “No, that’s all. Obtaining a sentence from 20,000 years ago is already not easy.” Miss Hong shook her head.
 “Then, is this mystic technique, the Universe Clock, the supreme mystic technique of the Heavenly Dao Sect?” Lin Jiufeng pointed at the sheepskin book and asked.
 “Yes, this is the supreme mystic technique of the Heavenly Dao Sect. It was Elder Universe who made this technique well-known to the world at that time. It’s very powerful, decisive, and has an extremely terrifying edge. It can touch the radiance of the universe and has a terrifying degree of fearlessness,” Miss Hong introduced.
 “I still have to thank you for bringing back the mystic technique of the Heavenly Dao Sect. It has already been lost for so long. If it weren’t for you bringing it back, I wouldn’t even know about it.” Miss Hong was grateful to Lin Jiufeng.
 “It’s just a small matter!” Lin Jiufeng waved his hand. He didn’t take a fancy to this mystic technique called the Universe Clock. He had no thoughts about it at all. He just wanted to figure out some things.
 “Where is that Undying Mountain?” Miss Hong asked. She wanted to explore it. She might be able to find the whereabouts of Elder Universe.
 “You can’t enter now, and even if you go in, you won’t be able to see his traces. It’s better to improve yourself well. The spiritual energy is exploding every day now, and you’ve also obtained the mystic technique from tens of thousands of years ago. You have to cherish this opportunity.” Lin Jiufeng rejected Miss Hong.
 At this stage, he wouldn’t bring anyone to the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 Moreover, without the little white cat’s bloodline, she couldn’t see Elder Universe. It would be a waste of time for Miss Hong to go there.
 “Alright, I will work hard in my cultivation. It’s my duty to restore the glory of the Heavenly Dao Sect!” Miss Hong said firmly.
 Lin Jiufeng looked around and asked, “Can I look at the books here?”
 “Feel free to do so. You can read every single one of them. I’m going to translate the cultivation technique, the Universe Clock. No one will come and disturb you,” Miss Hong said generously. Coincidentally, she didn’t know how to thank Lin Jiufeng. Letting Lin Jiufeng read the treasured books of the Heavenly Dao Sect here was also to thank Lin Jiufeng for bringing back the mystic technique of the Heavenly Dao Sect and the news of Elder Universe.
 After saying this, Miss Hong sat at the side and focused on translating the mystic technique. She saw the hope of the Heavenly Dao Sect rising in her hands.
 “She has reignited her hope of living!” The white cat laid on Lin Jiufeng’s shoulder and said.
 “That’s good. Go play as you please. I want to study the books here properly. There must be a lot of records about the past here.” Lin Jiufeng’s eyes were bright, carrying a trace of brilliance. He wanted to study well here.
 The white cat didn’t disturb Lin Jiufeng. She ran to one side alone and laid on the table to absorb the surging spiritual energy to improve herself.
 Lin Jiufeng casually picked up a book and opened the first page.
 [Do you want to Sign-In at the Heavenly Dao Sect library?]
 But these words appeared before his eyes.
 Lin Jiufeng raised his brows. He didn’t expect to trigger the sign-In here.
 He thought that he would trigger the sign-in after entering the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 Unexpectedly, he didn’t sign in in the Hundred Thousand Mountains but signed in the library of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 “Sign in!” Lin Jiufeng agreed.
 He also wanted to know what he would receive by signing in in the library.
 [Sign-In successful. Received the Book Spirit that enlightened the world!]
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the line of words in front of him and blinked.
 What was this Book Spirit that enlightened the world?
 A piece of information entered Lin Jiufeng’s spiritual consciousness.
 “The Book Spirit is the spirit of all the books in the world. It is born to enlighten the world. Anyone who is enlightened by the Book Spirit will have their spiritual consciousness expanded and become a genius.”
 This piece of information shocked Lin Jiufeng. He muttered in surprise, “If I place this in the Martial Temple and let the Book Spirit enlighten the young people of the world, doesn’t that mean that everyone in the Yuhua God Dynasty can become geniuses?”
 Even a stupid person could become enlightened under the enlightenment of the Book Spirit and have considerable achievements.
 This Book Spirit was of no help to Lin Jiufeng, but it was extremely useful to the Yuhua God Dynasty and the young people of the world.
 “Not bad, books indeed contain beauty.” Lin Jiufeng happily put the Book Spirit away. When he returned to the Yuhua God Dynasty, he should go to the Martial Temple and leave the Book Spirit there.
 At this moment, he calmed down and focused on reading.
 Ten lines at a glance!
 Lin Jiufeng flipped through the book and instantly absorbed all the information recorded in it.
 Then, he split out countless clones from his soul to pick up the other books and read them carefully.
 Lin Jiufeng did this in one smooth movement.
 The vast sea of books was quickly devoured by Lin Jiufeng.
 The accumulation of the Heavenly Dao Sect over the years was quickly consumed by Lin Jiufeng’s huge soul.
 Three days later, Miss Hong was still continuing to study the mystic technique of the sheepskin book. Lin Jiufeng bade her farewell, but she turned a deaf ear to him and remained obsessed with the vast world inside the book.
 Lin Jiufeng left with the little white cat.
 He didn’t attract anyone’s attention.
 “We didn’t seem to have gained anything from this trip?” The white cat asked curiously.
 “I know that mysterious old man is from the Heavenly Dao Sect. I know his name and some of the things that he has done. I even read the treasured books of the Heavenly Dao Sect. Is that not enough?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “I thought that Miss Hong from the Heavenly Dao Sect would be able to solve our doubts, but why do I feel that you are even more puzzled after reading these books?” The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng and asked suspiciously.
 Lin Jiufeng smiled and said, “I’m even more puzzled because I have new questions, but no one can answer them. I have to figure them out on my own.”
 “Can’t you tell me?” The white cat asked.
 “Telling you is just adding to your troubles, so I won’t tell you. When I find the answers, I will tell you. What you have to do now is to work hard in cultivation and improve yourself,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 The white cat was unable to refute. She was still too weak and had no prestige in front of Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng was just about to fly away from the Hundred Thousand Mountains when a line of words appeared before his eyes.
 [Do you want to Sign-In at the Hundred Thousand Mountains?]
 “Sign in!” Lin Jiufeng agreed without hesitation.
 He knew that he could definitely sign in at least once at the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 But he didn’t expect it to be triggered when he was leaving.
 This was unexpected.
 [Sign-In successful. Received Monster Slaying Sword!]
 The Monster Slaying Sword was an extremely terrifying immortal artifact. It was extremely sharp and extra effective against monsters.
 A sword that looked like a piece of jade appeared in Lin Jiufeng’s hand. The phrases as beautiful as jade and rainbow-like sword just so happened to be able to describe this sword.
 The Monster Slaying Sword was like a beauty and was held in Lin Jiufeng’s hand. Its edge flickered as if it could tear the sky apart in the very next moment.
 But Lin Jiufeng didn’t do that. He took out the sword case and stored the Monster Slaying Sword inside to nurture it well. Without alerting anyone, he left the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 He gained a lot this time, but he couldn’t guard this forgotten space as he did in the Northwest Territory.
 Because an unprecedented change was about to happen in this world.
 This time, it wasn’t just the Yuhua God Dynasty or Lin Jiufeng, but the entire world was facing this change together.
 The early stages of the recovery of spiritual energy had passed. This was already the middle stage. Very soon, the peak stage of spiritual energy recovery would be reached.
 A year later, the False Immortals could descend into this world.
 At that time, the False Immortals of the various major sects in the world would definitely appear.
 The entire world would become chaotic.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty would be the first to bear the brunt of this impact. Many factions who couldn’t wait to overthrow the Yuhua God Dynasty were already waiting.
 If Lin Jiufeng stayed here for too long, it would be a disaster for the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 A year later, when the immortals descended, the Yuhua God Dynasty definitely needed Lin Jiufeng’s support.
 Hence, he had to return.
 After leaving the Hundred Thousand Mountains, Lin Jiufeng’s speed was as fast as lightning. He returned to the vicinity of the imperial capital.
 He first went to the Martial Temple and released the Book Spirit inside.
 The Book Spirit was a very cute elf. He also knew his mission. Moreover, the Martial Temple was filled with an atmosphere of learning. The Book Spirit liked this place very much. After waving at Lin Jiufeng, he flew into the Martial Temple to enlighten the students.
 “I hope that the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty will all become geniuses!” Lin Jiufeng said to himself. This was his greatest hope. The people of the Yuhua God Dynasty would all be geniuses. Standing in this world, they would construct an ideal world suitable for ordinary people to live in.
 Cultivators could fight and go against the heavens to change their fate. The world was huge and everyone had their own way of living.
 But it didn’t mean that they could casually sacrifice the lives of ordinary people and ensure their safety. A powerful cultivation base wasn’t something that should be used to slaughter the common people.
 This was what the Yuhua God Dynasty was currently doing.
 After putting the Book Spirit inside, Lin Jiufeng returned to the imperial capital and entered the Cold Palace.
 The Cold Palace was deserted as usual, which suited Lin Jiufeng and the little white cat.
 The man and cat duo settled down in the Cold Palace.
 Lin Jiufeng wasn’t in a hurry to enter the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. He had only gone there a few days ago, and he had gained quite a lot. This time, he wanted to cultivate properly for a period of time.
 “I obtained the Dao Fruit of the mysterious old man in the Immortal Mountain. I have to comprehend it thoroughly this time. If I can successfully transcend the tribulation in one year and reach the Forming of the Five Energies stage, I will be able to better protect the Yuhua God Dynasty.” Lin Jiufeng said to himself.
 Before the mysterious Elder Universe died, various small cauldrons, array formations, eight trigrams, divine clocks, immortal phoenixes, and dragon sparrows appeared around him. Each of them represented a peerless immortal technique and also his Dao Fruit.
 At that time, Lin Jiufeng remembered these things in his eyes and didn’t dare to miss out on them at all. These were the things that he wanted to comprehend now. After comprehending these, he could also transcend the second lightning tribulation.
 “While you make go into seclusion and cultivate, I will also go cultivate and wait for a breakthrough. I can’t lag behind by too much from you,” the white cat said. She steeled her heart and stopped herself from thinking about Lin Jiufeng’s arms. She turned around and went to one side to cultivate alone.
 The man and cat in the Cold Palace were both working hard in their cultivation.
 The spiritual energy in the world doubled every day from the previous day. There was no limit to the surging spiritual energy.
 The breakthroughs of the people of the world also became simpler. Instantly, the number of people who brought disaster to the world increased. With powerful strength, but without a mentality to control strength, it was very easy for one to inflate, fall into confusion, be controlled by strength, and lose oneself.
 During this period of time, the crime rate in the Yuhua God Dynasty skyrocketed, and the common people of the world trembled in fear.
 Fortunately, after generations of outstanding students from the Martial Temple graduated, they became chess pieces to stabilize the world. They received orthodox education and their mentalities were very stable. After they broke through, they had no problem facing the sudden increase in strength and didn’t have any uncontrollable situations.
 These people were the backbone of the Yuhua God Dynasty’s stability.
 This world changed every day. Everyone could see this.
 In front of the Kunlun Mountains, Princess Yulin and her people guarded this place for a month. Seeing that there was no movement from the Kunlun Mountains, she brought the powerhouses with her and left. She left behind other people of the Yuhua God Dynasty to watch over here at all times.
 After Princess Yulin left with her people, a pair of vicious eyes stared at them from the Kunlun Mountains. The hatred in them couldn’t be washed away no matter what.
 This hatred came from Peacock King’s mother.
 Although she was afraid of the Yuhua God Dynasty and the Painting of the People, she didn’t forget the pain of losing her son at all.
 “A year later, I will destroy your Yuhua God Dynasty and devour the common people within the land of 100,000 miles. I will wash the land with blood as a sacrifice to my son!” Mother Peacock gritted her teeth and let out a resentful voice.
 The world fell silent for some reason.
 After the battle between the Yuhua God Dynasty and the Kunlun Mountains, everyone remained silent.
 Even the various demonic sects that were jumping around happily also quietened down. It was like they had changed into people that wouldn’t compete with others and just cultivate quietly, making people think that they were the Daoist priests instead.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty also quietened down. Everyone was working hard in their cultivation, especially the people in the Martial Temples. After receiving the guidance of the Book Spirit, each and every one of them began to work hard and be positive. In this world of great competition, they cultivated frantically, received an education, and nurtured their love for their country and their love for the people.
 In such a quiet situation, some old people sighed and said, “This is the calm before the storm. A huge storm is about to sweep the world.”
 Yes, a storm!
 Lin Jiufeng was also experiencing a storm. It was very powerful and blew down on him.
 The divine soul between his brows suddenly shone brightly. In his spiritual consciousness, waves of tsunamis-like sounds actually erupted. At the end of his divine soul, endless divine radiance rushed out like golden agate, forming a golden expanse, and it was accompanied by lightning and thunder.
 Lin Jiufeng’s eyes were closed. His expression was calm as he was completely immersed in his cultivation.
 At the side, the white cat stood up and watched silently.
 At this moment, tens of thousands of divine lights exploded around Lin Jiufeng’s body. They were as gorgeous as rainbows. Golden waves surged between his brows, accompanied by waves of lightning and thunder. It was extremely turbulent.
 Under the little white cat’s worried gaze, a violent tsunami was happening in Lin Jiufeng’s spiritual consciousness. The waves rushed into the sky, and the deafening tsunami sound seemed to be the galloping of a magnificent army. The little white cat shook her head forcefully, confirming that she wasn’t dreaming.
 “The tsunamis are endless, the sounds are like thunder, and the waves are in tens of thousands…”
 “Is this a divine soul?”
 “Why do I feel that there’s really a sea in his spiritual consciousness?”
 “Also, I saw a terrifying Fusang Divine Tree in his divine soul!”
 “This is too terrifying. Just how powerful is this man?”
 The white cat felt her mouth go dry. She looked at everything in front of her and was deeply shocked.
 Everything in front of her was like a dream. The rumbling waves in her ears were like a magnificent army galloping and fighting.
 At this moment, she seemed to be not standing in the Cold Palace but on the shore, facing a vast sea.
 Lin Jiufeng had been quiet and motionless all this time. He sat there cross-legged as divine flowers bloomed in his spiritual consciousness. They were gorgeous and dazzling. There were waves that never stopped, golden lights that flickered, lightning that danced, and surging waves.
 All of them appeared one by one between his brows. They were very intense, causing Lin Jiufeng’s aura to continuously rise.
 Cultivating had never been a problem for Lin Jiufeng.
 Now, he proved this.
 Elder Universe’s Dao Fruit was really a great supplement for Lin Jiufeng.
 What’s more, this wasn’t something he signed in to but had comprehended it himself.
 Now, five energies appeared in his chest.
 The heart was metal, the liver was wood, the spleen was water, the lungs were fire, and the kidneys were earth.
 These five energies overlapped and slowly rose to his shoulder, meeting up with the three flowers.
 A God’s Domain appeared around Lin Jiufeng. In this domain, there was the Sea Rising Bright Moon, the Great Dao Descending into the Mortal Realm, and the 12 Music of the Gods…
 There was also a Buddha that he had comprehended.
 This Buddha was round and naturally formed. It was completely naturally formed. It was dull, ancient, and natural. A faint Zen charm emanated from it.
 This was what he had comprehended from Elder Universe’s Dao Fruit after cultivating till now.
 The Buddha descended into Lin Jiufeng’s God’s Domain with a Bodhi Tree.
 This Bodhi Tree had other names, which were the Tree of Wisdom, the Tree of Awakening, and the Tree of Thinking. It was said that it could awaken the divinity of humans and come to a realization with oneself.
 Right now, Lin Jiufeng needed to combine the five energies in his chest with the three flowers to achieve the realm of Opening of the Three Flowers and Forming of the Five Energies.
 All of these combined could allow him to undergo a second lightning tribulation.
 After comprehending Elder Universe’s Dao Fruit, Lin Jiufeng went deep into it. Under the suppression of a Buddha carrying a Bodhi Tree, he wouldn’t lose himself. Now was the time to start.
 Boom!
 At this moment, Lin Jiufeng’s divine soul entered a profound realm. He felt auspicious colors descending from the sky, divine springs surging on the ground, and lotus flowers blooming. The branches of the Bodhi Tree were budding one after another.
 There was divine light filling the sky, and dragons and phoenixes appeared. There was a longevity turtle spitting out auspicious energy, an auspicious kirin drawing in energy, purple energy coming from the east, and golden light coming from the west.
 Five-colored divine light shone, and a seven-colored divine rainbow soared through the sky.
 At this moment, he opened the five energies and three flowers in his body and received Elder Universe’s Dao Fruit. The numerous wonderful phenomena and the endless techniques appeared in his heart, his sea of consciousness, and his body.
 It made Lin Jiufeng obsessed and unable to extricate himself.
 This type of profound sound seemed to be the divine sound of the heavens resounding through the world, but it was also like the chanting of a holy song of the Great Dao, causing one to be intoxicated.
 Lin Jiufeng was dazed and intoxicated.
 This feeling was like having rain after a long drought in the desert. Vitality began to appear in the endless yellow sand.
 At this moment, Lin Jiufeng felt that many windows had been opened all of a sudden. All sorts of divine light shot towards him, flowing to his limbs and bones. It made his body feel comfortable, and his flesh, organs, and bones were being nourished.
 At this moment, his organs erupted with five boiling energies that began to nourish Lin Jiufeng’s body.
 He comprehended the Great Dao and continued to cultivate.
 One month!
 Two months!
 Three months!
 It lasted for nine months.
 During this period, various phenomena appeared around Lin Jiufeng. They were mysterious and impermanent, causing the little white cat to be shocked at first.
 But towards the end, the white cat watched calmly.
 Specks of divine light appeared around Lin Jiufeng. For a period of time, they first resembled stars, then resembled chaos. Then, they would breathe out and transform, flowing into the void. A hazy fog was born and shrouded Lin Jiufeng. Finally, divine lights appeared and shone in the surroundings. There were millions of changes, but they weren’t fixed.
 In Lin Jiufeng’s spiritual consciousness, there was a golden sea. The Fusang Tree was in it, protecting Lin Jiufeng’s divine soul.
 In his God’s Domain, there were countless changes.
 In the huge God’s Domain, sometimes the galaxy filled the sky, and sometimes the sky was lonely.
 Death and nirvana, growth and decline, cycle after cycle, repeating endlessly.
 All of this lasted for nine months. After nine months, Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes and looked at the world.
 A light shot straight out from his eyes, even piercing through the sky. He calmly retracted his gaze and let out a long breath.
 “This is the longest non-stop seclusion I’ve ever gone into in my life. It’s so comfortable!” Lin Jiufeng said excitedly.
 After nine months of seclusion, Lin Jiufeng’s gains were too great.
 He had finally reached the Forming of the Five Energies stage.
 Of course, without transcending the tribulation, it would never be complete. But transcending the tribulation was already nothing to Lin Jiufeng.
 In these nine months, he had tempered his flesh, organs, and bones to become incomparably crystal clear. They were spotless and pure, like magnificent works of art.
 Even his skin began to glow with a crystal-like luster. Powerful life energy was slowly flowing through his body.
 With this body, Lin Jiufeng wasn’t worried at all about transcending the second lightning tribulation.
 The first tribulation transcendence was the divine soul’s tribulation. It required the Opening of the Three Flowers, but there was no need for it this time.
 Because the Forming of the Five Energies was from the body, the lightning tribulation this time also required the body to transcend the tribulation together.
 This wasn’t difficult for Lin Jiufeng.
 “Have you finished your seclusion?” The white cat asked in surprise.
 After nine months, she was still as cute as ever, but her cultivation had reached the peak of the Spirit Platform Realm!
 This was very good for the white cat. Her cultivation speed was becoming faster and faster.
 “It’s over. What happened in the outside world in the past nine months?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 His skin and limbs were all spread open as he absorbed the surging spiritual energy. Sensing the intensity of the spiritual energy, his expression couldn’t help but become serious.
 The density of the spiritual energy exceeded his expectations.
 “In the past nine months, the recovery of the spiritual energy has been equivalent to more than a year. Therefore, in this era, immortals can already descend,” the white cat said to Lin Jiufeng.
 As her words fell, Lin Jiufeng raised his head and looked at the world.
 Rumble!
 In the Hundred Thousand Mountains, there was a forgotten world that had been sealed by Miss Hong nine months ago.
 Miss Hong gave it a year’s time. This was what she calculated.
 But plans couldn’t keep up with changes. The extent of this recovery of spiritual energy far exceeded everyone’s understanding.
 No one knew that the speed of the recovery of spiritual energy would double. Everyone knew that it would be very soon, and they also knew that it would be in the near future.
 But most people thought that it would be a year later, Lin Jiufeng thought so too.
 But now, it had reached this level of recovery in nine months.
 The forgotten world that Miss Hong had sealed truly appeared now. In an instant, dozens of terrifying auras rushed into the sky, surging the sky, the sun, moon, and the galaxy, causing a stir in the world.
 The appearance of the forgotten world in the Hundred Thousand Mountains broke the ‘peace’ of the world.
 Boom!
 Boom!
 Boom!
 After these auras appeared, as if they had discussed it beforehand, the auras of countless False Immortals erupted in other places.
 The False Immortal Patriarchs of the various major sects and factions were awakened by their impatient descendants.
 This world entered the era of immortals!

                    



 Chapter 249: Light of the Homes, Descend!  
 Lin Jiufeng stood in the Cold Palace of the imperial capital and looked at the world. His expression was calm like a mirror, but his eyes erupted with an incomparably blazing light.
 “This world is no longer peaceful!” Lin Jiufeng said.
 ?
 The white cat jumped onto Lin Jiufeng’s shoulder. Seeing the terrifying auras surging, she also said, “This time, immortals are starting to step into the mortal realm!”
 A False Immortal was still an immortal!
 After the immortals came to the mortal realm, the Void Returning Realm cultivators were no longer able to rule the battlefield. The Yuhua God Dynasty was in grave danger.
 The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng’s fair and handsome face. This person who she worshipped and loved was the Yuhua God Dynasty’s Savior.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t speak. He watched silently as the various False Immortals with peerless auras exploded in the distance.
 …
 In the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the sealed space completely exploded at this moment. It swept through all directions like a storm, alarming the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race. All of them watched in surprise.
 “They have come out!” Demon King Jiao, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, laughed out loud. After being warned by Lin Jiufeng previously, he didn’t dare to approach this sealed space, nor did he dare to have any other thoughts. He thought that he would have to wait for a year, but now, the seal was broken in nine months. This was fantastic.
 Boom!
 A waterfall of chaos energy spread out from the forgotten world and drooped down. It landed from an extremely tall mountain peak of 30,000 feet long. In this forest, there was a pattern of the Great Dao interweaved. It immediately crushed the other mountain ranges into dust, turning them into black ashes.
 A figure walked out of these ashes. He walked over step by step, and a powerful aura flowed out of his body. The extremely terrifying light was like a fog of chaos, suppressing the Seven Great Sages until they were trembling in fear.
 “A False Immortal of the monster race!” Demon King Pingtian said as he stared fixedly at the person in front of him.
 This was a black bat that had taken human form. His face was demonic. Behind him, a black moon hovered in the air, bringing with him a terrifying river made of Yin energy that circled his body. His eyes were like blood moons, filled with killing intent.
 It was extremely terrifying!
 “A mere human girl dares to seal the Dreamcloud Lake, how dare she!”
 “15,000 years ago, the human race was just the food of the monster race. To be so impudent now, is this challenging the dignity of Dreamcloud Lake?”
 After the black bat appeared, he let out a sound that shook the sky. His powerful voice penetrated gold and spirit stones, shaking the ancient mountain peak until it hummed and shook as if it was about to collapse.
 “The humans actually dared to be so presumptuous when the Dreamcloud Lake went into hiding. It’s really true that when there’s no tiger in the mountains, the monkeys reigns supreme.”
 “The world of Dreamcloud Lake ruled the Hundred Thousand Mountains 15,000 years ago and is one of the Myriad Races. In this current world, we shall be the rulers!”
 “The era of the Myriad Races disappeared 15,000 years ago. We have waited for so long and have always sealed ourselves. We gave this world to the human race, and it’s time to take it back.”
 “For 15,000 years, I didn’t absorb human blood. Now, I’m going to devour a million humans!”
 In this forgotten space, the people living here were actually the former masters of the Hundred Thousand Mountains. They were also one of the Myriad Races called Dreamcloud Lake. Their False Immortal Realms were appearing one by one now.
 This overbearing, high and mighty, and completely unfair conversation was looking down on the humans as if they were lords of the world, letting out ferocious words. Accompanied by that rumbling aura that shook the world, countless people heard it.
 As soon as these words came out, the entire world was shocked. This Dreamcloud Lake race was already so arrogant as soon as they came into being. That False Immortal’s aura was like lightning, not hiding his strength at all. He was even more arrogant and despotic than the False Immortals in the Kunlun Mountains.
 Countless people were shocked. They felt that this was a sign of war. How would the Yuhua God Dynasty react?
 The False Immortals who came out of the Dreamcloud Lake all had auras that were like volcanoes that erupted. Their auras completely exceeded those of the False Immortals from the Kunlun Mountains back then.
 An old man said, “15,000 years ago, in the era where all races coexisted, the Dreamcloud Lake was also a large race. They ruled the Hundred Thousand Mountains, and they had many False Immortals. They were an ancient race. Now that they have appeared, they directly want to restore the prestige of their ancient race. It’s simply terrifying.”
 “There are already more than ten False Immortal auras in their race, surpassing the Kunlun Mountains. Will the Yuhua God Dynasty be able to withstand them?” Some of the common people became worried.
 “You shouldn’t be worried about a single Dreamcloud Lake race because, in other places, many races have recovered too.” Someone reminded.
 It was only then that everyone noticed that the ancient races were recovering in various places.
 For example, in the Southern Mountains, many top ancient races had appeared in the Endless Mountains.
 A valley appeared. It was actually the legendary Valley of Gods. The existences inside were all godlike and were very terrifying.
 The emergence of the Valley of Gods wasn’t as violent as Dreamcloud Lake’s, but they still made a sound.
 “The Human Race should return the land to the Myriad Races. This world needs to return to the era 15,000 years ago when all the races existed together. The Human Race cannot afford to enjoy such a huge territory.”
 The arrogance of the Valley of Gods was calm but also domineering. After they emerged into the world, they directly turned a large portion of the Southern Mountains into their own territory.
 They didn’t discuss it with the Yuhua God Dynasty at all.
 This change scared the common people quite a lot. All of them trembled and felt despair. The aura of the Valley of Gods was so terrifying and suppressed them till they couldn’t escape. They could only wait for their only hope.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty!
 It wasn’t just these two places. In the territory of the North Region, an ancient clan called the Barbarians appeared. The leader was the Barbarian King of the North Region. After he appeared, he let out a roar.
 Roar!
 On this day, the roar of the Barbarian King of the North Region shook the mountains and ravines. In the Northwest Territory, the entire land was trembling, shocking everyone and spreading to the world, especially the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 “The Yuhua God Dynasty deserves to be wiped out!” The 18 Demon Sects had also awakened their own False Immortals. They were very powerful, simply indescribable with words. After these terrifying demonic seniors appeared, they were arrogant and shattered the void with a raise of their hands.
 They were arrogant, despotic, and their auras devoured the mountains and rivers. These were the 18 Demon Sects. They didn’t belong to the Myriad Races of the ancient era and had developed in the recent eras.
 They also despised the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The people from the Dao Sects had also awakened their False Immortals. In the famous mountains and great rivers, they all fell silent, not saying a word. Clearly, they didn’t want to interfere in the matters of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 A Daoist False Immortal understood the actions of the Yuhua God Dynasty from the others. He sighed and said, “It’s a God Dynasty that has ideals and is the fortune of the common people. It’s a pity that the actions of this dynasty are too aggressive and have offended the Myriad Races. If we get involved, we will also fall into the eternal abyss with the Yuhua God Dynasty.”
 Since the Daoist sects wanted to continue their legacy, they naturally wouldn’t participate in all of this. They chose to put their own safety as the priority.
 There was even a terrifying Yinxu King Race that appeared in the world. 15,000 years ago, they were the top ancient race of the King Races of that era. They had been passed down for a long time and had never appeared in the world. Now that they had appeared, many powerhouses appeared together in this race. With a roar, the mountains and rivers collapsed, shaking the world. Their auras were peerless.
 As a powerful King Race of the Myriad Races, they were going to start a war today.
 “Humans are not worthy of having a God Dynasty!”
 A powerhouse of the Yinxu King Race shouted coldly. They were very aggressive. The humans of the King Race era were very weak, so in this era, the humans should be weak too.
 To let a Human God Dynasty suppress the world, the Kings of Yinxu were unable to restrain their anger. Even though they had no enmity with the Yuhua God Dynasty, when they heard of this matter, they still wanted to destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 And in the Kunlun Mountains that had been silent for nine months, the sound of a phoenix came. It came from Mother Peacock. She flew out of the Kunlun Mountains and looked at the world. Countless hidden worlds had appeared at this moment. The Myriad Races of the past had all appeared.
 “Yuhua God Dynasty, let’s see if you guys are dead this time!” Mother Peacock was in a good mood. She laughed out loud and let out an excited voice. She was very domineering.
 The top existences in the Kunlun Mountains and the False Immortals also began to awaken one by one.
 In the Nest of 10,000 Dragons, more than ten False Immortals had appeared. They had all recovered in the past few months.
 Huang Xian’er said excitedly, “Big Sister Divine Silkworm, the world is in complete chaos now. All races have come into being together. A great era is coming, should we take action and destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty?”
 When the other False Immortals heard this, they became tempted and rubbed their fists excitedly.
 Only Sister Divine Silkworm looked at the vast land with a solemn expression. “Is the Yuhua God Dynasty really that easy to destroy?”
 Huang Xian’er asked in puzzlement, “The Dreamcloud Lake, the Yinxu King Race, the Valley of Gods of the Southern Mountains, the Barbarians of the North Region, some powerhouses of the Demon Path, and even some of the top False Immortals of the Human Race are about to destroy this world. In such a situation, won’t the Yuhua God Dynasty be wiped out?”
 The others all nodded.
 “I think that the Yuhua God Dynasty can’t even withstand a single Dreamcloud Lake. The reason we want to take action too is to divide the territory of the world. In the past, our Nest of 10,000 Dragons ruled a large area. Now, we can expand the territory once again,” a False Immortal said.
 “That’s right. A group of weak humans from the Yuhua God Dynasty can’t withstand such an attack at all. They will be wiped out in a flash. Occupying more territory and reviving the glory of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons is what we should be doing now,” another False Immortal said.
 The others also said their thoughts in a few words.
 It was obvious that they had always looked down on the Yuhua God Dynasty and thought that the Yuhua God Dynasty could be wiped out at any moment. There was no need to worry at all.
 Sister Divine Silkworm looked at Huang Xian’er and the others and said softly, “But why do I feel that the Yuhua God Dynasty won’t be so easily destroyed?”
 Huang Xian’er asked in surprise, “Sister Divine Silkworm, why do you feel this way?”
 “That terrifying immortal artifact of the Yuhua God Dynasty hasn’t been used yet,” Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 “That immortal artifact can suppress nine False Immortals, but can it suppress 18, 36, and more than a hundred False Immortals?” Huang Xian’er shook her head, disagreeing with Sister Divine Silkworm.
 “On this day alone, there are already hundreds of recovered False Immortals. This world has suddenly become a world ruled by the False Immortals. How many False Immortals does the Yuhua God Dynasty have? How can they withstand such a terrifying situation?” Huang Xian’er said disdainfully.
 She said so much because she wanted to kill her way into the Yuhua God Dynasty and capture Princess Yulin. Then, she wanted Princess Yulin to be her maid and torture her properly.
 Huang Xian’er believed that this was a good opportunity.
 If it was too late and Princess Yulin was killed, she wouldn’t be able to take revenge even if she wanted to.
 “Let’s wait and see first. Now that the world has changed, the Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely think of a solution. I reckon that the immortal artifact is about to come into being!” Sister Divine Silkworm’s eyes lit up. She had a feeling.
 If the Yuhua God Dynasty wanted to continue suppressing the world, they had to make a move soon.
 The appearance of the False Immortals from various places had already caused trouble for the world’s common people in the past. Some of the False Immortals needed to taste blood after they came into being and began to torture and kill the common people of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The imperial capital!
 Cold Palace!
 Lin Jiufeng was observing the world. When he saw Peacock Mother in the Hundred Thousand Mountains beginning to devour humans to vent her anger for her son’s death, his face turned cold.
 “You are seeking death yourself. Do you really think that my Yuhua God Dynasty cannot suppress this world?” Lin Jiufeng’s eyes were cold. He turned around and walked out of the Cold Palace. When he arrived at the door, he saw the [Light of the Homes].
 [Light of the Homes] also sensed the great change in the world. It swayed slightly and the candlelight was deep.
 “This time, you can completely shine and suppress the world!” Lin Jiufeng took down the [Light of the Homes] and said softly.
 The candlelight of the [Light of the Homes] flickered, emitting gentle light as if it was answering Lin Jiufeng’s words.
 Then, the [Light of the Homes] flew into the sky and stopped above the imperial capital. A candle flame suddenly trembled.
 Dang…
 Right at this moment, the trembling voice of the [Light of the Homes] spread throughout the world accompanied by its candlelight.
 In an instant, all the noise in the world disappeared.
 The flames of the [Light of the Homes] jumped and suppressed all sounds. The resplendent lights weren’t weak anymore. Instead, they burst out with infinite flames that spread for tens of thousands of miles, causing the world to instantly become peaceful.
 The powerful auras, powerful agitation, and surging killing intent caused by the False Immortals disappeared.
 Everyone raised their heads in fear. When they saw the flames of this mortal realm, they were all stunned.
 In the candlelight, they saw themselves, their ordinary lives, and their brilliant and beautiful lives.
 Peaceful and profound!
 The common people calmed down and their hearts became pure. Each of them placed their beautiful hope in life on the [Light of the Homes].
 In an instant, this lamp that stood between heaven and earth became dazzling, suppressing all the commotion.
 It was as if it had come from the ancient era, opening the darkness of this era and illuminating a resplendent world.
 In the Dreamcloud Lake, the bodies of the False Immortals who had just appeared stiffened. Sensing this terrifying might, the faces of every False Immortal stiffened. They trembled and their hearts were incomparably terrified.
 This candle flame wasn’t simple. It suppressed their divine souls, made them tremble, and made their bodies crack. They couldn’t resist at all.
 “What the hell is this?” King Black Bat shouted in a low voice. He was at the False Immortal Realm, but he was completely unable to resist this candle flame at this moment.
 He was alarmed. This was very strange. 15,000 years ago, no such situation had happened before.
 “I don’t know, but this is even stronger than an immortal artifact, right?”
 “Is this an immortal artifact that has undergone extreme sublimation?”
 “Isn’t this too terrifying? I feel that my divine soul has already produced cracks.”
 “These flames are too resplendent.”
 The False Immortals of Dreamcloud Lake were trembling in fear. All of them felt terrible. They couldn’t resist the might of the [Light of the Homes] at all.
 It was the same in the Valley of Gods of the Southern Mountains. The high and mighty gods that had just appeared were now drenched in sweat as they resisted the pressure of the [Light of the Homes] with great difficulty.
 In the Barbarians of the Northern Region, the Barbarian King gritted his teeth. He straightened his body and looked at the [Light of the Homes] with a solemn gaze.
 “I didn’t expect that the Human Race had such a magic treasure. It can suppress the world and is very powerful, but do you really think that it can suppress the Myriad Races?” The Barbarian King snorted coldly. Although the pressure of the [Light of the Homes] was very powerful, he straightened his back and forcefully resisted it.
 And near the Kunlun Mountains, Mother Peacock wanted to devour the common people and vent a portion of the hatred in her heart first.
 She flew to the place where humans lived. After devouring only a few people, she heard the sound of the [Light of the Homes]. With a bang, her body sank, and she was immediately pressed to the ground.
 Then, the candle flame fell like a heavenly fire that could burn everything, instantly igniting Mother Peacock.
 “No…” Mother Peacock cried out in a tragic manner. She wanted to escape, but she couldn’t escape from the flames. Even her divine soul was ignited.
 In less than three seconds, Mother Peacock was burned to ashes.
 Not a trace was left!
 At this moment, the sounds emitted by the [Light of the Homes] were long and reverberated throughout the world. Be it the Myriad Races from 15,000 years ago or the Demon Sects, Daoist Sects, or top factions from thousands of years ago…
 They were all suppressed by the candlelight of the [Light of the Homes]. The candlelight tore through the void and cleansed all evil, suppressing the past and present, and reverberated throughout the land.
 Once the [Light of the Homes] appeared, the entire world submitted to it!
 At this moment, countless people were petrified, and countless powerful cultivators were trembling. The entire world instantly fell silent, and only the candlelight of the [Light of the Homes] flickered.
 It was clearly daytime, but the emergence of the Myriad Races brought with them endless darkness.
 The appearance of the [Light of the Homes] lit up the world. It was like the first wisp of light that appeared at the beginning of time, illuminating this vast land, making all living beings tremble and suppressing the world.
 After nine months of peace in this world, the Myriad Races came into being and opened the curtain of the era of immortals. The terrifying False Immortals had peerless auras, each of them seeming to want to shatter the eternal heavens.
 The extremely terrifying sharpness made all the human cultivators tremble from the bottom of their souls.
 Countless common people trembled in fear. They truly believed that the Yuhua God Dynasty was finished.
 The Myriad Races were too powerful.
 But after the appearance of the [Light of the Homes], at this moment, countless people knelt down and prostrated in the direction of the imperial capital. They were sincerely grateful and as the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty, they were proud from the bottom of their hearts.
 So what if they were the Myriad Races?
 So what if they were immortals?
 The Human Race’s Yuhua God Dynasty could similarly suppress them.
 Before the recovery of spiritual energy, the Yuhua God Dynasty was suppressing the world.
 After the recovery of the world’s spiritual energy, the Yuhua God Dynasty was still suppressing the world.
 At this moment, after seeing the true appearance of the [Light of the Homes], many human cultivators teared up.
 In the Martial Temple, the young students kowtowed piously as if they were paying their respects to a god. Their bodies were trembling.
 The [Light of the Homes] had never appeared and had always been unknown in the past. No one knew that the Yuhua God Dynasty had such a terrifying immortal artifact.
 Even though the False Immortals in the Kunlun Mountains were suppressed by a painting of the people nine months ago and let the people know that the Yuhua God Dynasty had such a treasure, they still couldn’t see its true appearance then.
 But today, the Myriad Races had come into being. They wanted to bathe the world in blood. In order to protect the common people, the true appearance of the [Light of the Homes] was shown to the world.
 A clap of thunder sounded amidst the calm!
 A hero in troubled times!
 To establish its might in front of the Myriad Races!
 To establish the might of the Human Race!
 The humans were all in an uproar, but the Myriad Races were silent. They experienced both joy and great sorrow on this day. Many sealed False Immortals came into being. After being separated from the world for 15,000 years, they thought that they could still suppress the world. But in the blink of an eye, reality slapped them, making them fall silent.
 Looking at the [Light of the Homes], no one dared to say that they could resist it.
 Didn’t they see Mother Peacock, who was also a False Immortal, being instantly burned and completely disappearing?
 The most awkward ones were the False Immortals of the Demon Sects. They were aggressive and wanted to destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty, cause chaos in the world, and create a world where only the fittest survived.
 But now that the [Light of the Homes] had appeared, the world was silent. No one dared to stand out. Those arrogant ancient races were all standing quietly too.
 This was like a heavy blow or a slap to their faces.
 Not long ago, the people of the Demon Sects were still being overbearing. They looked down on the world and talked about the world as if they owned it. They also said that the Yuhua God Dynasty was about to be wiped out and the era of spiritual energy recovery was when heroes and kings should compete for supremacy.
 But after saying these words, the [Light of the Homes] ignited the hope of the world, carried the hope of the common people, and warned the cultivators of the world.
 The people from the Demon Sects were speechless.
 At this moment, the [Light of the Homes] swayed and shone on the world. No one in the world dared to resist it!
 These Myriad Races that had appeared in the world were aggressive at the beginning. Their auras were surging and they wanted nothing more than to immediately display their might and announce that the world had returned to the era of 15,000 years ago.
 But now, they were all obedient and holed up in their lairs, not daring to take any further action.
 No one dared to stand out. Now that the Yuhua God Dynasty had displayed the might of the [Light of the Homes], whoever dared to stand out would be immediately killed. Mother Peacock was the best example.
 The world was quiet. The [Light of the Homes] hung high in the sky. All the races were afraid of it and stayed dormant, not daring to make any move.
 At this moment, the common people everywhere in the world were already in an uproar. The [Light of the Homes] cut through the darkness like the first divine light of the beginning of time, illuminating the path of the Yuhua God Dynasty and giving them great hope.
 They were cheering, jumping for joy, and worshiping the Yuhua God Dynasty in excitement.
 The prestige of the Yuhua God Dynasty was truly known to all.
 In the current world, the Yuhua God Dynasty was still suppressing the world.
 Even the emergence of the Myriad Races couldn’t change this situation.
 The [Light of the Homes] shone for three days and three nights. The powerhouses of the Myriad Races were suppressed for three days and three nights too. Many people’s bodies cracked open, their divine souls exhausted, and they almost collapsed. They were endlessly terrified.
 Three days later, the [Light of the Homes] disappeared and returned to the door of the Cold Palace. It was still hanging here.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the [Light of the Homes] and said, “You are the last trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty. Letting you intimidate the world and warn the Myriad Races not to act rashly is already enough. I will handle the subsequent matters myself. Continue to absorb the resplendent scent of life in the world and continue to become stronger.”
 [Light of the Homes] swayed. After hearing Lin Jiufeng’s words, all the pressure coming from it disappeared without a trace.
 This suppression lasted for three days. The Myriad Races in the world kept quiet out of fear and hid in their lairs, not daring to take a step out.
 At this moment, the [Light of the Homes] disappeared. It seemed that the cultivators of the world were intimidated. The common people were cheering and singing the glorious achievements of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 But they didn’t know that an even larger storm was about to arrive.
 Lin Jiufeng muttered to himself, “Just suppressing them with the [Light of the Homes] for three days is far from enough. If I don’t kill enough people, how can I intimidate these rebellious Myriad Races?”
 Lin Jiufeng walked back to the Cold Palace and closed the door.
 “I shall see what you guys will do after knowing that the Yuhua God Dynasty has the [Light of the Homes].” Lin Jiufeng smiled calmly. He was very interested in their response.

                    



 Chapter 250: Convention of the Myriad Races!  
 [Light of the Homes] returned to the Cold Palace after suppressing the world.
 During this period of time, the Myriad Races had been lying dormant, silent. The powerful False Immortals were uneasy in their hearts. Facing the Yuhua God Dynasty that they had previously disdained, they developed a frightened mentality.
 ?
 After the [Light of the Homes] illuminated the world this time, all living creatures in the current world were convinced of its might.
 The Valley of Gods, the Nest of 10,000 Dragons, the Barbarians of the North Region, and Dreamcloud Lake were all stunned. They were worried. If the Yuhua God Dynasty really wanted to sweep through the world, how should they respond to the [Light of the Homes]?
 Fortunately, the [Light of the Homes] disappeared. The extremely powerful pressure also disappeared, making one’s heart calm down.
 In this period of time, the human race had been the most excited. From their initial tears to being excited, they all hoped that the Yuhua God Dynasty would continue to suppress the world and let the common people have a stable and peaceful life.
 The appearance of the [Light of the Homes] further increased the cohesion of the common people in the Yuhua God Dynasty. The sentiments of a nation were vividly reflected in this era.
 At this moment, many aristocratic families that had been passed down for thousands of years also had members who were very bright. They took the initiative to show goodwill to the Yuhua God Dynasty, hoping to integrate into the Yuhua God Dynasty and become a part of it.
 Ultimately, the aristocratic families were also humans. Although these families were quite powerful, they weren’t comparable to the Myriad Races and the powerhouses of the Demon Path. The aristocratic families were all large families. They didn’t have many powerhouses, but they had a lot of descendants. They had to integrate into the Yuhua God Dynasty in order to ensure the continuation of their families.
 Of course, there were also many sacrifices for the aristocratic families to integrate into the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Firstly, they had to turn in all the family’s books. They were allowed to leave a copy behind, but they had to hand over the family’s books to the Martial Temple.
 Moreover, the aristocratic families were not allowed to rear private soldiers, nor were they allowed to own the land inside the Yuhua God Dynasty. This restricted the expansion of the aristocratic families to a certain extent, but that was all. As long as they followed the laws of the Yuhua God Dynasty and didn’t bring disaster to the common people, the Yuhua God Dynasty was still very lenient to them.
 In the imperial capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty, Emperor De and Princess Yulin witnessed the emergence of the [Light of the Homes] throughout. It caused a stir and suppressed the world, intimidated the Myriad Races, and protected the common people of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 “The Yuhua God Dynasty having Big Grand-Uncle is a great blessing.” Emperor De sighed.
 “Big Grand-Uncle’s might far exceed our imagination. What we can do now is to manage the Yuhua God Dynasty well and not cause trouble for Big Grand-Uncle. Moreover, we have to nurture our own False Immortals as soon as possible. This way, we can help Big Grand-Uncle relieve some of the pressure,” Princess Yulin said calmly.
 “Yes, we also need to strengthen ourselves. Leave the state affairs to me, as for the cultivation matters, I shall let you handle them.” Emperor De nodded, agreeing with Princess Yulin.
 “I will keep an eye on those powerhouses. According to the extent of this spiritual energy recovery, it won’t be long before the Yuhua God Dynasty also has its own False Immortals. Big Grand-Uncle won’t be the only one bearing the pressure then,” Princess Yulin said expectantly.
 Be it the Scholar Wen or Fire Lord, they were both people who had already broken through 99% of the way and were only one step away from the False Immortal Realm.
 There was also Old Man Luo, King Kaoshan, and Bai Tiandi.
 Over the past year, their progress had been very fast. Reaching the False Immortal Realm was just a matter of time.
 As long as Lin Jiufeng remained at the peak for a period of time, the Yuhua God Dynasty would have the confidence to face the Myriad Races.
 In the Dreamcloud Lake, a terrifying Monster King was roaring in a low voice. The aura and sound it emitted made the mountains tremble as if they wanted to shake the sky down.
 “The Human God Dynasty actually has an immortal artifact, and it’s even an immortal artifact that has been completely activated. This is impossible. I don’t believe that there’s anyone in this era who can completely activate an immortal artifact. This shouldn’t exist!” The terrifying Monster King’s low roar shocked the monsters in the entire Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 “Monster King, shall we continue to probe this Yuhua God Dynasty? How can humans have an immortal artifact? It must be fake. Let’s constantly test their bottom line and see if this candlelight is a fake immortal artifact!” A Little Monster King suggested.
 Boom!
 But this Monster King had a savage nature. When he looked up, it was as if millions of years had passed. His eyes seemed to contain the power of reincarnation. The Little Monster King who spoke just now was sent flying on the spot, heavily injured.
 “You want the Dreamcloud Lake Race to take the lead and test the Yuhua God Dynasty? A fake immortal artifact? Then what if it’s true? Won’t my Dreamcloud Lake Race have to face such a terrifying immortal artifact head-on?” The terrifying Monster King said coldly. He was very angry.
 “Monster King Baiyu, please forgive me! Monster King Baiyu, please forgive me!” The Little Monster King immediately begged for mercy in a very lowly and humble attitude.
 The true form of this Monster King was an immortal crane, but he wasn’t as serene and peaceful as the other immortal cranes. He was very irritable and also very powerful. He was one of the few terrifying Monsters Kings in Dreamcloud Lake.
 Monster King Baiyu stood up. He was tall and had a wisp of white feathers on his head. His face was cold and his aura was sinister. His aura filled the air and he stood in the air like a terrifying demon.
 “Why is it that after 15,000 years, the humans who we treated as blood food back then can still rise up? They even ruled this world and have an immortal artifact that has completely recovered?” Monster King Baiyu looked coldly at the vast world. The area ruled by the humans made him feel extremely uncomfortable.
 In his understanding, the human race was a weak race and was the food of the Myriad Races. They could only rely on some powerful races to ensure their continuation and prevent their destruction.
 But who would have thought that after 15,000 years, the human race would replace all the other races and become the only ruler of this world?
 This made him feel uncomfortable all over, especially during the period when he was suppressed by the [Light of the Homes]. He had always watched coldly as the humans cheered and the hearts of the weak humans were united. There was only infinite ridicule in his heart.
 “No matter how many weak ants are gathered, an elephant can crush them all with a single step. This is how humans are. They aren’t worth mentioning,” Monster King Baiyu said disdainfully.
 These words instantly received the agreement of the other powerful monsters of the Dreamcloud Lake Race. None of them could accept the rise of the human race. They had enjoyed being high and mighty for so long in their hearts. The former human race was so lowly, so what right did they have to rise up now?
 The human race should have stayed lowly just like in the past!
 This was the thought of the powerhouses of the Dreamcloud Lake Race.
 This was also the unanimous thought of the Myriad Races that had reemerged.
 Seeing the rise of humans and seeing them reign over the world, these monsters felt uncomfortable.
 But with the [Light of the Homes], they didn’t dare to be the first to challenge the Yuhua God Dynasty and bet that after the [Light of the Homes] appeared once, it wouldn’t have any more power in the future. This was too risky for them.
 “Monster King, what should we do now? I don’t want to see humans continue to be so arrogant.” An ox monster asked angrily.
 “Wait.” Monster King Baiyu looked at the world and said calmly.
 After the initial shock and panic, he had calmed down. Many thoughts appeared in his mind.
 The first thing to do now was to wait.
 “Wait until we familiarize ourselves with this world, wait until we find out the secret of the Yuhua God Dynasty, wait until we join forces. Time will tell us whether the Yuhua God Dynasty is really powerful or is just a paper tiger,” Monster King Baiyu said, calming the other monsters of the Dreamcloud Lake down.
 It wasn’t just Dreamcloud Lake. The other races that had come into being had all calmed down. Facing the Yuhua God Dynasty, they chose not to resist and silently understood this world.
 As such, 15 days passed.
 Fifteen days was enough for them to understand this world.
 It was only then that the powerhouses of the various races knew that in the time that they disappeared, a tide had begun to appear in the spiritual energy. After a period of time, it would disappear, and after a period of time, it would recover and reach its peak.
 They also knew about the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty had only been established for a few hundred years. From the old era to the new era, the efforts of several generations of people to support the downfall of the nation had saved the Yuhua God Dynasty and allowed it to develop to its current state.
 The most important reason why the Yuhua God Dynasty could suppress the world was because of that hidden ancestor.
 After this news was released, the people of the Myriad Races were ready to act.
 “The Yuhua God Dynasty has an immortal artifact, but it can’t continuously be activated. The ancestor of the Yuhua God Dynasty also can’t continuously use it. The Yuhua God Dynasty isn’t terrifying!”
 Finally, one of the Kings of the Myriad Races stood forward. He was once a famous figure and said to the Myriad Races of the world the above words.
 When the Myriad Races heard this, it caused a huge commotion.
 “I believe in what the King Invincible said.”
 “King Invincible is a very powerful young King among the Myriad Races. He has taken a few more steps in the False Immortal Realm. He’s very terrifying.”
 “There must be a reason for his observation. I was wondering why the Yuhua God Dynasty didn’t use that immortal artifact to kill us all. It turns out that it’s very difficult to use it.”
 “Then, is it that the Yuhua God Dynasty won’t activate that immortal artifact again if we deal with them?”
 No one answered this question. Although everyone was tempted, no one dared to stand out and try.
 But after King Invincible said these words, it caused an uproar in the Yuhua God Dynasty, which had been peaceful for many days. The atmosphere instantly became much more nervous.
 Amongst the Myriad Races, who was the most qualified to say this?
 It was none other than King Invincible. Not only was it because he was powerful and invincible, but it was also because he came from the Primordial God Mountain and was the inheritor of a top race.
 In the recent days after the recovery of the Myriad Races, King Invincible entered and left the territories of the various races, clearly explaining his point of view that the Yuhua God Dynasty’s immortal artifact could only be used a few times. Moreover, that Patriarch backing the Yuhua God Dynasty wasn’t powerful, so there was no need to be afraid.
 The Myriad Races should deal with the Yuhua God Dynasty together. They couldn’t let the humans step on them and rule the world.
 Many races in the Myriad Races were convinced. After being tempted, they joined the camp of the King Invincible. For a time, waves surged and the world seemed to be about to receive another storm.
 There was also a reason why King Invincible hated the Yuhua God Dynasty so much.
 The Primordial God Mountain that he was from was a top race, to begin with. 15,000 years ago, the Nest of 10,000 Dragons transformed into the 10,000 Dragon God Dynasty that was on par with the Primordial God Dynasty and divided up a large portion of the world.
 The 10,000 Dragon God Dynasty was supported by the Nest of 10,000 Dragons.
 The Primordial God Dynasty was supported by the Primordial God Mountain.
 But now, most of the territory that the Primordial God Dynasty had once ruled was now ruled by the Yuhua God Dynasty, including the imperial capital. 15,000 years ago, the current imperial capital was also the imperial capital of the Primordial God Dynasty.
 King Invincible naturally wanted to take back these territories.
 In his opinion, the territory that once belonged to the Primordial God Dynasty was now occupied by the weakest human race. Moreover, the human race was even suppressing the world now. This was a great disrespect and a humiliation to the Primordial God Dynasty.
 King Invincible believed that the Yuhua God Dynasty was a dove occupying a magpie’s nest. They didn’t know what was good for them and were seeking death.
 At the same time, this was also a form of desecration towards the Primordial God Mountain. The weak human race actually dared to openly rule the world. This was a grave sin for the human race which was once the ridicule of everyone.
 These crimes were unforgivable!
 King Invincible walked into the territories of many ancient races and formulated a plan. Then, he stood out and spoke, being the first to stand out.
 Instantly, the people of the Myriad Races were all staring at King Invincible.
 What would the Yuhua God Dynasty do now that he publicly stood up to resist the Yuhua God Dynasty?
 Wasn’t the Yuhua God Dynasty going to use the immortal artifact [Light of the Homes] to kill King Invincible?
 If this didn’t happen, it would mean that King Invincible was right.
 On the Primordial God Mountain, King Invincible was also silently waiting.
 He was the first to stand up against the Yuhua God Dynasty. Logically speaking, the Yuhua God Dynasty should make an example of him to warn the other races.
 Therefore, it was best for the Yuhua God Dynasty to use the might of the immortal artifact to kill King Invincible and also teach the Primordial God Mountain a deep lesson. Only then could the Yuhua God Dynasty instill fear in the Myriad Races of the world.
 But after three consecutive days, there was no movement from the Yuhua God Dynasty at all.
 In the imperial capital, Emperor De and Princess Yulin gathered together, speechless.
 “Big Grand-Uncle is declining visitors in the Cold Palace,” Princess Yulin said helplessly. She went to see Lin Jiufeng, but the doors of Lin Jiufeng’s Cold Palace were tightly shut. His attitude was clear, so Princess Yulin returned.
 “King Invincible of the Primordial God Mountain is challenging us. Big Grand-Uncle definitely knows about this matter. It’s up to him how he wants to handle this. I believe in Big Grand-Uncle,” Emperor De said solemnly.
 Although three days had passed, there was no movement from the Yuhua God Dynasty, which aroused the suspicion of all the Myriad Races.
 King Invincible used himself as bait to arouse everyone’s suspicion of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Some time ago, the [Light of the Homes] suppressed the world and indeed scared many people.
 But now, the Myriad Races had calmed down. They began to think calmly and began to doubt whether the [Light of the Homes] of the Yuhua God Dynasty could continue to suppress the world.
 Was there really no limit in using a fully activated immortal artifact?
 Could the Yuhua God Dynasty withstand the burden of using a fully activated immortal artifact?
 King Invincible had helped to test everyone’s doubts in the past few days.
 On the Primordial God Mountain, a young man stood on a black cliff. He was dressed in purple, his expression indifferent and unmoved. His aura was icy, and his eyes were cold.
 This was King Invincible, the heir of the Primordial God Mountain. He had an aggressive character. He was the first to stand up and question the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Logically speaking, the Yuhua God Dynasty should have come to kill him.
 But after three days, there was no response from the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 King Invincible couldn’t help but sneer. “As expected, bluffing has always been the human race’s forte. It was like this 15,000 years ago, and still the same after 15,000 years!”
 Boom!
 Under the night sky, King Invincible soared into the sky. His mountain-like huge body stood in the air, looking incomparably terrifying. With a bang, several pairs of wings broke out from behind him and spread out. They instantly covered the bright moon in the sky and swept up a demonic cloud.
 “Yuhua God Dynasty, you guys will definitely be wiped out this time. My Primordial God Mountain will lead the way and join forces with the Myriad Races to launch a convention of the Myriad Races. The Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely be crushed into dust!” In the dark sky, King Invincible spoke very calmly. However, in his eyes, a large area of mountains and rivers collapsed. The sun and moon sank, and there was also blood flowing like a river and corpses everywhere. It was as if this was the future of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 At this moment, the eyes of King Invincible burst forth with the power and experience of the endless cycle of reincarnation.
 He was deducing the future. Using the Myriad Races as the foundation, he had come to a conclusion.
 The human race and the Yuhua God Dynasty would definitely be wiped out!
 King Invincible stood in the air. Demonic energy overflowed from him, making him look like an undying and majestic demonic mountain.
 …
 The cold moon, the quiet night, the rise and fall of the mountains and rivers, everything was silent.
 Everything in the world fell into silence. Due to the recovery of spiritual energy and the expansion of the world, there were many new mountains and ravines. Under the night sky, each of them looked like ancient ferocious beasts that wanted to devour the world.
 Not long ago, a piece of news came from the Primordial God Mountain.
 The newly emerged Myriad Races would join forces to hold a convention of the Myriad Races. The Hundred Thousand Mountains was chosen as the location. The people of the Yuhua God Dynasty would be invited to enter the convention to discuss the ownership of this world!
 The timing was three days later!
 As soon as this news came out, it was like a raging fire that spread throughout the world. The entire world was shocked. Even in the dark night, no one could calm down.
 The Myriad Races actually joined forces to hold a meeting for the sake of a single human race and specifically asked the Yuhua God Dynasty to participate.
 If the Yuhua God Dynasty didn’t participate, everyone knew what the outcome would be.
 Attacks from the Myriad Races!
 The people of the world discussed fervently.
 “The convention of the Myriad Races? This sounds very amazing.” Someone was surprised.
 “Of course. 15,000 years ago, the convention of the Myriad Races was a grand event. Everyone knew about it, but there has never been a convention of the Myriad Races held for a particular race. Our human race has really gained prestige.” An old man self-mocked.
 He would rather not have this prestige.
 Many people who knew the inside story were discussing.
 “The Myriad Races actually agreed to the convention?”
 “Holding a convention of the Myriad Races for the sake of a single human race? Do they really want to destroy the human race that much?”
 “I wonder if the Yuhua God Dynasty can withstand the pressure of the Myriad Races this time?”
 “I think it’s going to be difficult. Unless the Yuhua God Dynasty brings the immortal artifact there. But if the immortal artifact can be used, it would have already been used to kill King Invincible previously, instead of letting him be so arrogant and even hold the convention of the Myriad Races.” An old man sighed.
 “Then, isn’t this world going to become chaotic?” Someone asked sadly.
 “No, I believe in the Yuhua God Dynasty. They have done too many impossible things. This time, they will definitely be able to turn the tide and make the impossible possible.” Some people also firmly believed in this.
 “This time, it’s impossible for the Yuhua God Dynasty to turn the tables. Without the suppression of a fully activated immortal artifact, even Gods and Immortals will find it difficult to save them. The Yuhua God Dynasty has been suppressing the world for all these years, but now, it will be bearing the consequence too.” Some people also added insult to injury.
 In just one night, the entire world was discussing. The world that had finally calmed down with great difficulty erupted again.
 Many people turned their eyes to the imperial capital.
 They were looking at the Forbidden City!
 What choice would Emperor De in the Forbidden City make?
 Emperor De and Princess Yulin knew of this news immediately. They hurriedly went to the Cold Palace and asked to see Lin Jiufeng again.
 This time, Lin Jiufeng received them.
 The Cold Palace was deserted and dilapidated as usual. Here, Lin Jiufeng saw the alarmed Emperor De and Princess Yulin.
 “What’s wrong?” Lin Jiufeng asked calmly.
 “Big Grand-Uncle, King Invincible has joined forces with the other races to hold a convention of the Myriad Races. He specifically asked the Yuhua God Dynasty to participate and discuss the ownership of the world. It will be held in three days’ time!” Emperor De calmed himself down and said.
 “Oh? That’s not bad,” Lin Jiufeng smiled and said. But after Lin Jiufeng heard this, he wasn’t surprised and was instead delighted.
 Princess Yulin said in surprise, “Big Grand-Uncle, this is the convention of the Myriad Races! Can that immortal artifact of yours still be activated?”
 “Not yet, it needs to replenish its energy.” Lin Jiufeng shook his head.
 After [Light of the Homes] absorbed the scent of life in the mortal world for a period of time, it would recover to its original state.
 Just as King Invincible had guessed, if a magic treasure of the level of the [Light of the Homes] was being powered by Lin Jiufeng, it would be unable to display such a powerful and terrifying power.
 Making magic treasures of this level operate on their own would consume a lot of things.
 For [Light of the Homes], it consumed the scent of life of the mortal world.
 “Why is Big Grand-Uncle so happy without the immortal artifact?” Princess Yulin asked curiously.
 Without the immortal artifact, they wouldn’t have the confidence to deal with the Myriad Races.
 But Lin Jiufeng asked, “What is the Yuhua God Dynasty’s greatest trump card?”
 Princess Yulin hesitated for a moment and said, “It’s Big Grand-Uncle!”
 Emperor De nodded. The trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty had never been the [Light of the Homes]. Previously, Princess Yulin and Emperor De had encountered this lamp hanging in front of the Cold Palace many times, but they didn’t take it to heart. They had never believed that the trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty was the [Light of the Homes].
 The Yuhua God Dynasty only had one trump card.
 It was Lin Jiufeng.
 As long as Lin Jiufeng was around, the Yuhua God Dynasty would be around too.
 Lin Jiufeng smiled and said, “This trump card, which is me, has been hidden behind the scenes for too long. Since they have organized a convention of the Myriad Races, how can I not go?”
 “Big Grand-Uncle is going personally?” Princess Yulin looked at Lin Jiufeng in surprise.
 But then, she said worriedly, “That’s the combined force of the Myriad Races. We don’t know how many False Immortals they have.”
 “That’s right. Big Grand-Uncle, please reconsider.” Emperor De also advised.
 Lin Jiufeng seriously thought about it again and said, “I’ve reconsidered. I still choose to go.”
 Princess Yulin and Emperor De stopped talking.
 “If I can beat the Myriad Races until they don’t dare to move anymore, it will be for the best for the Yuhua God Dynasty. Therefore, there’s no need to worry. Go back and handle other matters,” Lin Jiufeng said to the two of them.
 Princess Yulin and Emperor De were very worried, but Lin Jiufeng waved his hand. They didn’t dare to disobey and could only take their leave.
 After leaving the Cold Palace, Princess Yulin turned around and looked at the tightly shut door. She took a deep breath and said, “Big Grand-Uncle who has been living in seclusion all this time is about to appear in the eyes of the public.”
 Emperor De looked at the crumbling Cold Palace that was about to collapse at any moment. There was also the weak candlelight that protected this Cold Palace. The anxiety in his heart instantly disappeared.
 “Since Big Grand-Uncle is going to the meeting, then the Yuhua God Dynasty shall go too. This time, either the Myriad Races will be defeated or the Yuhua God Dynasty will be wiped out. Big Grand-Uncle will fight in front and we will clean up all the troubles behind. I believe in Big Grand-Uncle!” Emperor De said firmly.
 “During this period of time, several people in the Void Returning Realm broke through to the False Immortal Realm. I have also entered the Void Returning Realm. The Yuhua God Dynasty can be considered to have gained some confidence. I will gather these people now and wait for orders,” Princess Yulin said solemnly.
 Since they had decided on this, they would persist until the end.
 Wasn’t it just a convention of the Myriad Races?
 The siblings firmly believed that their Big Grand-Uncle would definitely succeed in defeating them.
 And in recent days, top existences like Fire Lord, Scholar Wen, Old Man Luo, King Kaoshan, and Bai Tiandi had all broken through to the False Immortal Realm, which was just nice as they could provide support for Lin Jiufeng.
 This was the all-out battle of the Yuhua God Dynasty!
 After Emperor De and Princess Yulin returned to the Forbidden City, these words were spread.
 “One person from the Yuhua God Dynasty will participate in the convention!”
 As soon as these words came out, the entire world was in an uproar!
 Chapter 251: Lin Jiufeng Has Come To Kill You All  
 The words that came from the Forbidden City spread throughout the world in an extremely short period of time.
 The entire world was shocked!
 ??
 The decision of the Yuhua God Dynasty exceeded everyone’s expectations.
 It didn’t admit defeat but also didn’t take out the immortal artifact to suppress the world again.
 Instead, it chose to let one person participate in the convention of the Myriad Races!
 What did this mean?
 Who was this person?
 After everyone’s shock, they frantically discussed and debated, wanting to know who exactly this person was.
 This person actually wanted to participate in the convention alone.
 Countless people were saying that the Yuhua God Dynasty was seeking death.
 There were many False Immortals in the convention of the Myriad Races. If the Yuhua God Dynasty only sent one person there, wasn’t this seeking death? What was the difference?
 But someone else also said, “The person who is going this time is definitely the Yuhua God Dynasty’s greatest trump card. All this time, whenever the Yuhua God Dynasty turns misfortune into fortune, there has always been the influence of such a mysterious person behind the scenes. Everyone guessed that he existed, but it has never been confirmed. But now, the Yuhua God Dynasty has pushed him into the light.”
 This analysis immediately gained everyone’s agreement.
 The various sects, factions, and ancient races all had different expressions on their faces. Some were very solemn, some were dismissive, some ignored this, and some were calm.
 “Even if this Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty appears, he can’t stop the Myriad Races from descending into the world. Someone who’s born in this era and wants to overturn the world?” A False Immortal of the ancient races was supercilious and had an arrogant attitude. He didn’t take Lin Jiufeng seriously at all.
 “The Human Race is just a group of ants. They have only lived till now because they are taking advantage of the absence of the Myriad Races. Now, they are actually placing their hopes on an old man who hides in the dark and doesn’t dare to come out. Just wait and see how the Myriad Races crush him into dust and completely destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty in three days’ time.” The False Immortal of the ancient race let out a cold smile, feeling extremely confident.
 “Three days later, we will exterminate the Yuhua God Dynasty and slaughter the humans of the world. We will make rivers of blood flow and corpses spread all over the world to celebrate the arrival of the Myriad Races in this world.” A King of the ancient races standing proudly on a mountain peak with his hands behind his back let out a sonorous sound. He looked down at the world and talked about it. He was eager to take action. He was just waiting for the convention of Myriad Races to directly destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty in three days’ time.
 After that, he could start a massacre!
 “The only way to make the humans continue to fear us is to kill!” A False Immortal of the ancient race said coldly.
 After these words spread, they incurred the anger of many people. But facing the False Immortal of the ancient race, they could only say a few aggrieved words of hatred, but they couldn’t do anything concrete.
 When Lin Jiufeng, who was in the Cold Palace in the imperial capital, heard this, he couldn’t help but nod and said, “He’s right. If you want others to be afraid of you, the only way is to kill. I hope that three days later, they will be afraid of me!”
 He left the Cold Palace with the little white cat. After bidding farewell to the [Light of the Homes], he walked out of the imperial capital and headed for the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 This time, he didn’t use his power to travel there. Instead, he bought a carriage and let the little white cat drive the carriage for him. He sat in the carriage and headed for the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 There were still three days, which was more than enough time to rush over.
 And in these three days, the discussions of the people in the world didn’t weaken. Instead, the discussions became more and more intense.
 Those who supported the Yuhua God Dynasty and those who supported the Myriad Races were arguing non-stop.
 In these three days, the Hundred Thousand Mountains that had always been quiet and peaceful became the center of attention of the world.
 In the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the people of Dreamcloud Lake were making preparations.
 When King Invincible chose this location for the convention, the False Immortals of Dreamcloud Lake had also agreed.
 They didn’t believe that the person from the Yuhua God Dynasty could overturn the world.
 He didn’t bring the immortal artifact along, yet he still wanted the Myriad Races to fear him?
 What a joke!
 Dreamcloud Lake chose an open area for the convention. It was surrounded by mountains on all sides. Sunlight shone in and decorated the surroundings, the scenery was picturesque.
 The ancient trees were like a horned dragon. Their branches were strong and stretched towards the sky, scattering a shade on the ground.
 Monster King Baiyu stood under an ancient tree and looked into the distance. The ancient tree above his head swayed, causing the shadow of the tree to dance. This place was very quiet. The people of the Dreamcloud Lake were setting up the place, and no one spoke.
 “Kill that powerhouse behind the Yuhua God Dynasty here and then destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty. I’m quite interested in that immortal artifact. I wonder if I can obtain it!” Monster King Baiyu said to himself. His expression was still cold. The aura around him rose and became even stronger. Standing here, he had an aura of supremacy.
 In his heart, he didn’t take Lin Jiufeng seriously at all.
 So what if the trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty was a False Immortal?
 Was there a lack of False Immortals in the Myriad Races?
 Hence, Monster King Baiyu was very domineering and confident. He wanted to use this opportunity to expand the prestige of the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 On one side of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the previous rulers of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race, were gathered here. Their territory was reduced to the area here and they had given up the right to rule the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 Even though the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race had started to enter the False Immortal Realm and were beginning to recover to their peak, they were still no match for the monsters and demons from the Dreamcloud Lake.
 After Dreamcloud Lake came into being, they drove the Seven Great Sages out of the core area. However, the Dreamcloud Lake powerhouses didn’t make things difficult for them.
 Neither did they make things difficult for the Seven Great Sages nor did they take the Seven Great Sages seriously. Instead, the Dreamcloud Lake powerhouses even suppressed them a little, wanting to take them in as dogs.
 The Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race had mixed feelings when they saw the busy Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 Especially the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao.
 He had always been devoted to making the monster race stand up again, and he had worked hard for this.
 Now, the monster race had indeed stood up. However, it was different from what he had imagined.
 The emergence of the various ancient races completely divided the Monster Race. In the past, the different races would help each other. They were all from the Monster Race and weren’t differentiated from each other. When they came to the Hundred Thousand Mountains, they could cultivate and live quietly.
 But now, the different races within the Monster Race were separated. When the Myriad Races descended into this world of great competition, they immediately destroyed the old order and created a new order.
 During this period, countless monsters died.
 If it weren’t for the Seven Great Sages relying on this huge amount of spiritual energy and recovering their strength to the False Immortal Realm, they would have long been forcefully taken in by the Dreamcloud Lake Race.
 But even so, they were still pushed to the side by the Dreamcloud Lake Race.
 If it weren’t for the fact that they were busy with the convention of the Myriad Races, the Dreamcloud Lake Race would definitely have forced the Seven Great Sages to join them.
 This made the Seven Great Sages very depressed.
 The development of the situation was completely different from what they had imagined.
 Demon King Jiao, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, said angrily, “If I had known that such a huge race would come out, I wouldn’t have worked so hard.”
 When Dreamcloud Lake was still sealed, the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race paid a lot of effort to compete with Miss Hong in breaking the array formation that Miss Hong had meticulously set up. Although they ultimately gave up on continuing because of Lin Jiufeng’s arrival, this couldn’t erase the efforts they had put in.
 But after Dreamcloud Lake appeared, they naturally took over the Hundred Thousand Mountains and drove the Seven Great Sages to the side, ignoring them.
 How could Demon King Jiao not be angry?
 The other Great Sages smiled bitterly.
 “We should have thought of this long ago. In reality, this matter is different from what we thought. We should have expected it.” Demon King Dapeng, who had suffered a blow this time, began to reflect on himself.
 “This matter is a lesson to us. Now that the Myriad Races have descended, the living environment of the Monster Race is indeed better. Our initial wishes have also been fulfilled. As for the control of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, let’s just let it go. Let’s change places and cultivate diligently. The sooner we become true immortals, the sooner we can escape the title of False Immortal,” said the Great Sage of the Moving Mountain, Demon King Gui.
 “But I’m unwilling to accept this,” Demon King Jiao said in a low voice.
 “The Dreamcloud Lake Race is very powerful. Even if we recover to our peak, we are still no match for them. They are an ancient race from 15,000 years ago, and we are only from the Monster Race from thousands of years ago. The gap between us isn’t small at all. We can’t defeat them,” Demon King Pingtian said.
 “Then, we should just give up the Hundred Thousand Mountains to them?” The Great Sage of the Dreaming, Yun Shanhai, asked indignantly. He was also unwilling to give up.
 “There are two sides to everything. Whether this Hundred Thousand Mountains exists or not will depend on the situation three days later,” the Great Sage of the White Clothed, Bai Zilong, said.
 “What do you mean by that?” Demon King Dapeng asked in puzzlement.
 “You don’t think that the Yuhua God Dynasty can suppress the Myriad Races and defeat the powerhouses of these ancient races by sending just one person, do you?” Demon King Dapeng shook his head in extreme disdain.
 “We all know who the Yuhua God Dynasty will send. He’s not a person who has recovered from past eras. He’s not someone from thousands of years ago, nor is he someone from tens of thousands of years ago. He’s from this era. Even if he’s the best of this era and the so-called Son of Destiny, he won’t be able to defy the heavens and change his fate. Even with a cultivation base at the False Immortal Realm, it’s also not possible,” Demon King Jiao gritted his teeth and said.
 He was really afraid of Lin Jiufeng.
 It wasn’t hatred, because Demon King Jiao didn’t dare to hate. He was just afraid of Lin Jiufeng, a fear that came from his bones.
 But even so, he didn’t think that Lin Jiufeng would win in the convention of the Myriad Races.
 Because this was impossible.
 Demon King Pingtian said, “But I believe otherwise. I think that he will definitely stand out in this convention of the Myriad Races and let the world know of his existence. He is the top existence in this era!”
 “You’ve been brainwashed by this person,” Demon King Jiao said impolitely.
 “Do you want to make a bet?” Demon King Pingtian looked at Demon King Jiao.
 “What bet?” Demon King Jiao looked at Demon King Pingtian without showing any weakness.
 “He will suppress the Myriad Races in the convention and defeat them,” Demon King Pingtian said.
 Demon King Jiao only sneered.
 “Bet on what?” Bai Zilong looked at them curiously.
 “If you lose, leave the Hundred Thousand Mountains with us and go join the Yuhua God Dynasty!” Demon King Pingtian said.
 Demon King Jiao’s face turned angry. “You want me to join the Human Race?”
 The other five monsters and demons had different looks on their faces.
 Some were angry, some thought calmly, and some agreed with this statement.
 “It’s just a bet. You don’t dare to bet?” Demon King Pingtian asked calmly.
 “Why wouldn’t I dare?” Demon King Jiao laughed from extreme anger. “I don’t believe that the Myriad Races that ruled the world 15,000 years ago would actually lose to a single person. It’s simply a joke!”
 “If you lose, what’s the price?” Demon King Jiao asked Demon King Pingtian coldly.
 “I’ll do whatever you say. I have no objections, I’ll listen to you,” Demon King Pingtian said calmly.
 “Alright, it’s a deal!” Demon King Jiao agreed without hesitation.
 “This is a bet that I will definitely win, but you still dare to bet with me? You’re simply seeking humiliation!” Demon King Jiao said coldly.
 Demon King Pingtian didn’t refute him. Instead, he looked at the others and asked, “Do the rest of you want to join in the bet?”
 “Let’s join too.”
 “If the person behind the scenes of the Yuhua God Dynasty really wins, joining the Yuhua God Dynasty isn’t something unacceptable.”
 “Demon King Pingtian, you are very confident in this person?”
 “That’s right. Your confidence is too blind.”
 “Although I agree to join the Yuhua God Dynasty, I also don’t believe that he can suppress the Myriad Races. I even think that it will be a miracle if he isn’t killed by the Myriad Races.”
 Demon King Dapeng, Demon King Gui, Demon King Yuan, Bai Zilong, and Yun Shanhai all spoke one after another. None of them believed in Demon King Pingtian.
 “No matter how much I say now, you guys won’t believe me. I once saw his growth with my own eyes. That speed of his growth simply exceeded my expectations. Therefore, I firmly believe in him this time. Anyway, it’s just three days. Let’s see the result in three days’ time.” Demon King Pingtian didn’t explain and only fixed the bet.
 “Let’s see how you lose.” Demon King Jiao snorted coldly.
 Demon King Pingtian smiled without saying anything.
 …
 In the Kunlun Mountains, the people of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons were gathered together.
 “How many people are we sending to participate in this convention?” A False Immortal asked.
 “There are so many people at the convention of the Myriad Races. Just send two False Immortals over to show our presence, but don’t do anything,” Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 “Why not? If the Nest of 10,000 Dragons kills the Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty this time, the reputation of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons will instantly spread throughout the world. Whether it’s recovering the 10,000 Dragon God Dynasty from 15,000 years ago or occupying territory and becoming a sacred land, we will benefit greatly.” Huang Xian’er didn’t understand Big Sister Divine Silkworm’s decision.
 “That’s right, Miss Divine Silkworm. If we don’t make a move and just be a bystander, wouldn’t we be letting the people of the Primordial God Mountain stand out?” A False Immortal asked, puzzled.
 “Initially, the people of the Primordial God Mountain had already made a name for themselves during this period of time. King Invincible appeared and organized the convention of the Myriad Races, becoming famous in the world. Is our Nest of 10,000 Dragons not going to do anything?”
 “Even though our top powerhouses, those False Immortal big shots who have transcended four to five lightning tribulations, have yet to come into being, we shouldn’t be afraid of the people of the Primordial God Dynasty.”
 “If the Primordial God Dynasty really destroys the Yuhua God Dynasty this time, it will definitely not be a good thing for our Nest of 10,000 Dragons.”
 The False Immortals of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons discussed and expressed their opinions. They felt that Miss Divine Silkworm’s actions were too frustrating for them.
 If it weren’t for the fact that Big Sister Divine Silkworm’s status was extremely high, they definitely wouldn’t have listened.
 “Is the Yuhua God Dynasty that easy to destroy?” Sister Divine Silkworm asked calmly.
 “Big Sister Divine Silkworm, what do you mean by that? You still think highly of the Yuhua God Dynasty?” Huang Xian’er asked, puzzled. She didn’t know why she still thought highly of the Yuhua God Dynasty. It was obvious that the Yuhua God Dynasty was going to be destroyed.
 “That Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty isn’t simple. The convention of the Myriad Races won’t be as you guys think. You have to observe carefully instead of just following the crowd. If the Yuhua God Dynasty was really that easy to destroy, it wouldn’t have suppressed the world and ruled billions of people now,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm explained.
 “Moreover, since the Primordial God Mountain is willing to take the lead, then let them be. This time, the Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely erupt with unprecedented strength. Let the Primordial God Mountain probe out the trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty. To us, there are only benefits and no harm. We will just lose some prestige, but this little thing can be ignored. Don’t you guys know how to think on your own?” Big Sister Divine Silkworm looked at the people in front of her and shook her head helplessly.
 They didn’t even know how to weigh the pros and cons.
 All they knew was to stare at the surface of the matter, their brains impulsively calculating the small gains and losses.
 “Big Sister Divine Silkworm, are you saying that the Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely withstand the pressure of the convention of the Myriad Races?” Huang Xian’er asked suspiciously.
 “Not necessarily. I didn’t say that.” Big Sister Divine Silkworm shook her head.
 “I’m just saying that those people from the Primordial God Mountain want to destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty and establish their might, but they are thinking too simply. The Yuhua God Dynasty definitely has a trump card. That immortal artifact is also not as simple as they think. Even if the Primordial God Mountain wiped out the Yuhua God Dynasty, they would definitely pay a terrible price. It’s not as simple as they think,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 As soon as these words came out, everyone began to think.
 Big Sister Divine Silkworm’s words seemed to be right.
 “For that little bit of reputation, taking such a huge risk isn’t worth it at all. This is also the reason why I didn’t let you guys make a move. I reckon that it isn’t just us this time. There are also many other ancient races who will watch the show and choose to be a bystander. The people who will really make a move are the Primordial God Mountain and Dreamcloud Lake. Plus some other brainless False Immortals,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said disdainfully.
 Huang Xian’er finally understood that there was also this level of consideration.
 “Next, we just need to watch the show, that’s all,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 …
 Three days passed in a flash!
 The preparations for the convention of the Myriad Races were almost done. At this moment, the eyes of everyone in the world were cast here.
 In the ordinary alleys, streets, and restaurants, countless people were discussing how powerful this convention that was arranged by the Myriad Races would be.
 Some storytellers made up stories from the news they had heard and told them to others. The more ridiculous and strange their stories, the more the number of people who listened.
 Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 A small path was opened up into a huge basin surrounded by mountains on all sides. The scenery along the way was very beautiful.
 In just three days, the place looked brand new. It had been renovated to the point that the peaks of the mountains were surrounded by auspicious energy. The auspicious soil was accompanied by a rosy glow, and the lake in the distance was shrouded in mist.
 Looking into the distance, there was no lack of majestic auras in the beautiful mountains and rivers. There was a 3,000 feet silver waterfall that flowed straight down. There were 8,000 feet tall mountains that pierced straight into the clouds, like a majestic immortal realm.
 Together, the scenery was picturesque, adding to the atmosphere of the convention.
 In the convention of the Myriad Races, there was the sound of a zither. In the mountains, in the ancient forest, on the shore of the lakes, there was auspicious light lingering. Mist rose and a hundred birds flew together in a peaceful manner.
 But this was just the surface. It looked peaceful and beautiful.
 But no one in the world believed that what they saw was all there was to it.
 On this day, after the sun rose, everyone in the world watched this place.
 All the major factions, ancient races, aristocratic families, and the God Dynasty were watching.
 Boom!
 An extremely terrifying aura descended, sweeping across the sky and earth. Accompanied by a thunderous sound, a few figures walked over from the intersection of heaven and earth.
 All of them were tall and incomparably majestic. They were like small mountains, extremely oppressive as if they could crush this world.
 These people were all False Immortals, and they were all from the same ancient race.
 Primordial God Mountain!
 They walked very slowly, but their auras were quite terrifying. Each of them seemed to have experienced thousands of disasters, making them eternal and indestructible. They were in harmony with the world and integrated into the Great Dao.
 There were a total of nine of them!
 Nine False Immortals!
 For the sake of this convention of the Myriad Races, the Primordial God Mountain gave it its all. It took out nine False Immortals at once. Moreover, these nine False Immortals had all experienced lightning tribulation.
 Their cultivation base wasn’t as hollow as those who had just entered the False Immortal Realm, but someone who had undergone the baptism of lightning tribulation.
 They came together and walked together. Their terrifying and powerful auras almost made the ground sink. At this moment, a bell sounded in the sky. No one knew who rang it, but this bell was sounded for these nine False Immortals.
 They walked over. In the early sunlight, they were drowned by a blazing light. Each of them was covered in a layer of golden light.
 Among the nine, the leader was King Invincible. He had the appearance of a human. His face was cold and his body seemed to be gilded, sparking in the light. The only thing that was special about him was a pair of huge wings on his back, representing that he wasn’t a human.
 King Invincible brought the eight False Immortals to the front of the convention. Looking at the convention of the Myriad Races that had no humans, he sneered. “Don’t tell me that person from the Yuhua God Dynasty is hiding in fear?”
 The eight False Immortals behind King Invincible had cold looks on their faces. They didn’t even take a glance at this so-called convention of the Myriad Races. As for the countless pairs of eyes watching from the surroundings. they were just ants in their eyes.
 Boom!
 From the Dreamcloud Lake Race, a False Immortal also came out. It was a black crow. He sneered and said, “What right does the Human Race have to be compared to the Myriad Races? They are just taking advantage of the time that we have disappeared. Now that we have returned, what right do they have to discuss the world with us?”
 As soon as these words came out, the various major factions in the world felt aggrieved. These Myriad Races were too domineering, looking down on the humans.
 Even those factions that were at odds with the Yuhua God Dynasty frowned at this moment.
 But they didn’t even dare to be angry. The gap between them and the Myriad Races was too huge. They felt slightly sad in their hearts. The arrogance of the Myriad Races towards the Human Race came from their hearts. They just felt that the Human Race wasn’t good enough.
 Even if there was a Yuhua God Dynasty that could suppress the world, it was still not enough.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty suppressed the world while the Myriad Races weren’t around.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty had an immortal artifact that had displayed its might, but the Myriad Races were still unafraid.
 The words of the False Immortals of the Primordial God Mountain and the Dreamcloud Lake now could be said to be very cruel, but no one from the Human Race dared to stand out and oppose.
 Standing out meant going to war with the Myriad Races. No one had the courage to do so.
 Even the various Demon Sects that had always yearned for the death of the Yuhua God Dynasty fell silent at this moment.
 The people from the Primordial God Mountain and Dreamcloud Lake were very arrogant. As for the people from the other ancient races, they all stood aside without saying anything. Just as Big Sister Divine Silkworm had said, they were just watching the show.
 They would let the people from the Primordial God Mountain and Dreamcloud Lake take the lead.
 “The convention of the Myriad Races is just a joke. Is there anyone of the Human Race who is on the same level as us? That person from the Yuhua God Dynasty hasn’t appeared until now. Does he plan to hide for the rest of his life?” King Invincible smiled disdainfully and said.
 “If he doesn’t appear today, the next step will be to slaughter half of the Human Race. There are too many humans now,” Black Crow of the Dreamcloud Lake Race smiled cruelly and said.
 Countless humans heard this. They gnashed their teeth in anger, but they also felt despair.
 After the people from the two ancient races, the Primordial God Mountain and the Dreamcloud Lake, had appeared, there were already more than ten False Immortals. This wasn’t even counting those who were just watching the show. But the Yuhua God Dynasty only had one person who was supposed to come here. How was this person supposed to fight?
 How could he resist?
 The key was that this person still hadn’t appeared.
 Everyone in the world was paying attention to this battle, and they were also looking forward to Lin Jiufeng’s arrival.
 They looked forward to it.
 Right now, the auras of the Myriad Races were too domineering, suppressing the Human Race until they couldn’t breathe. No one dared to oppose the Myriad Races.
 The major factions from thousands of years ago didn’t dare to do so.
 In the entire world, there was only the Yuhua God Dynasty who dared to.
 Dong!
 Right at this moment, under the expectant gazes of everyone, countless people, and the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty…
 A sound of footsteps came from the ends of heaven and earth.
 This sound of footsteps seemed to have combined with the pulse of this world. Stepping on the ground was like stepping on everyone’s hearts, making them excited. Everyone couldn’t help but look over.
 A clear and peerless scene was imprinted in the hearts of countless people.
 The rising sun slowly climbed out of the mountaintop. It scattered golden multicolored light that filled the sky, dying the ground with a golden halo. It was magnificent.
 And at the ends of heaven and earth in the distance, a carriage slowly drove over, then stopped. A tall and straight figure opened the curtain and walked out. Then, he took a step forward and walked over calmly.
 In the eyes of the people, he was dressed in snow-white clothes. His figure was slender, handsome, and tall as he walked firmly towards the convention of the Myriad Races.
 This was a False Immortal!
 His aura alone wasn’t inferior to the combined auras of the nine False Immortals of the Primordial God Mountain.
 He walked out of the blazing sun and draped on the red robe that the sun of the mortal world had scattered on him, adding a layer of holy brilliance to him.
 His entire being didn’t have a soul-stirring aura, but dressed in white, he looked otherworldly. Under the gaze of the Myriad Races, he walked over steadily. His face was handsome and his temperament was peerless!
 The person behind the scenes of the Yuhua God Dynasty!
 The Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty that everyone talked about was actually so handsome and almost immortal-like. Countless human cultivators watching actually cried at this moment. It wasn’t known whether they were excited, happy, or aggrieved, but hot tears flowed down their faces.
 In this era, with the recovery of spiritual energy, the Human Race had always been aggrieved.
 Be it the major factions from thousands of years ago or the Myriad Races from 10,000 years ago, the people of this era didn’t have many feelings for them.
 They were like outsiders who had descended into this era, bringing them endless chaos and snatching countless resources.
 Only the Yuhua God Dynasty, the God Dynasty that was born and raised in this era, was the support of the common people. The people of the world had been ruled by the Yuhua God Dynasty for hundreds of years, generation after generation. Till now, the Yuhua God Dynasty was improving by the day and suppressing the world.
 The people of the world had a special sense of intimacy with the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 And now, this sense of intimacy made all the humans of this era cry in excitement upon seeing Lin Jiufeng, who descended into this world like an immortal.
 The Human Race had hopes of being saved now.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty could also be saved.
 All this time, the Patriarch who had only existed in everyone’s mouths, the supporter of the Yuhua God Dynasty, had walked out of the darkness and stood in front of everyone.
 The first thing he faced was the convention of the Myriad Races.
 Mainly the two ancient races, the Primordial God Mountain and the Dreamcloud Lake.
 There were also the ancient races who were silently observing.
 Hundreds of False Immortals descended into the world, but the Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty still walked over firmly.
 He walked out of the sun, bringing with him hope.
 At this moment, Lin Jiufeng arrived in front of the convention of the Myriad Races. He stood there, blending with the world as his aura rose infinitely.
 He was dressed in white and stood tall without a speck of dust. He looked extraordinary.
 “Lin Jiufeng from the Human Race has come to kill you all!” His handsome face, determined expression, and peerless charm made him look like an immortal king who had descended into this mortal realm. But the words that he said caused an uproar in the world.
 Confident!
 Arrogant!
 Wasn’t the Myriad Races arrogant?
 Then, he would be even more arrogant than them!
 He was here to kill them all.
 The group of them was surrounded by him alone!

                    



 Chapter 251: Lin Jiufeng Has Come To Kill You All  
 The words that came from the Forbidden City spread throughout the world in an extremely short period of time.
 The entire world was shocked!
 ?
 The decision of the Yuhua God Dynasty exceeded everyone’s expectations.
 It didn’t admit defeat but also didn’t take out the immortal artifact to suppress the world again.
 Instead, it chose to let one person participate in the convention of the Myriad Races!
 What did this mean?
 Who was this person?
 After everyone’s shock, they frantically discussed and debated, wanting to know who exactly this person was.
 This person actually wanted to participate in the convention alone.
 Countless people were saying that the Yuhua God Dynasty was seeking death.
 There were many False Immortals in the convention of the Myriad Races. If the Yuhua God Dynasty only sent one person there, wasn’t this seeking death? What was the difference?
 But someone else also said, “The person who is going this time is definitely the Yuhua God Dynasty’s greatest trump card. All this time, whenever the Yuhua God Dynasty turns misfortune into fortune, there has always been the influence of such a mysterious person behind the scenes. Everyone guessed that he existed, but it has never been confirmed. But now, the Yuhua God Dynasty has pushed him into the light.”
 This analysis immediately gained everyone’s agreement.
 The various sects, factions, and ancient races all had different expressions on their faces. Some were very solemn, some were dismissive, some ignored this, and some were calm.
 “Even if this Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty appears, he can’t stop the Myriad Races from descending into the world. Someone who’s born in this era and wants to overturn the world?” A False Immortal of the ancient races was supercilious and had an arrogant attitude. He didn’t take Lin Jiufeng seriously at all.
 “The Human Race is just a group of ants. They have only lived till now because they are taking advantage of the absence of the Myriad Races. Now, they are actually placing their hopes on an old man who hides in the dark and doesn’t dare to come out. Just wait and see how the Myriad Races crush him into dust and completely destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty in three days’ time.” The False Immortal of the ancient race let out a cold smile, feeling extremely confident.
 “Three days later, we will exterminate the Yuhua God Dynasty and slaughter the humans of the world. We will make rivers of blood flow and corpses spread all over the world to celebrate the arrival of the Myriad Races in this world.” A King of the ancient races standing proudly on a mountain peak with his hands behind his back let out a sonorous sound. He looked down at the world and talked about it. He was eager to take action. He was just waiting for the convention of Myriad Races to directly destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty in three days’ time.
 After that, he could start a massacre!
 “The only way to make the humans continue to fear us is to kill!” A False Immortal of the ancient race said coldly.
 After these words spread, they incurred the anger of many people. But facing the False Immortal of the ancient race, they could only say a few aggrieved words of hatred, but they couldn’t do anything concrete.
 When Lin Jiufeng, who was in the Cold Palace in the imperial capital, heard this, he couldn’t help but nod and said, “He’s right. If you want others to be afraid of you, the only way is to kill. I hope that three days later, they will be afraid of me!”
 He left the Cold Palace with the little white cat. After bidding farewell to the [Light of the Homes], he walked out of the imperial capital and headed for the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 This time, he didn’t use his power to travel there. Instead, he bought a carriage and let the little white cat drive the carriage for him. He sat in the carriage and headed for the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 There were still three days, which was more than enough time to rush over.
 And in these three days, the discussions of the people in the world didn’t weaken. Instead, the discussions became more and more intense.
 Those who supported the Yuhua God Dynasty and those who supported the Myriad Races were arguing non-stop.
 In these three days, the Hundred Thousand Mountains that had always been quiet and peaceful became the center of attention of the world.
 In the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the people of Dreamcloud Lake were making preparations.
 When King Invincible chose this location for the convention, the False Immortals of Dreamcloud Lake had also agreed.
 They didn’t believe that the person from the Yuhua God Dynasty could overturn the world.
 He didn’t bring the immortal artifact along, yet he still wanted the Myriad Races to fear him?
 What a joke!
 Dreamcloud Lake chose an open area for the convention. It was surrounded by mountains on all sides. Sunlight shone in and decorated the surroundings, the scenery was picturesque.
 The ancient trees were like a horned dragon. Their branches were strong and stretched towards the sky, scattering a shade on the ground.
 Monster King Baiyu stood under an ancient tree and looked into the distance. The ancient tree above his head swayed, causing the shadow of the tree to dance. This place was very quiet. The people of the Dreamcloud Lake were setting up the place, and no one spoke.
 “Kill that powerhouse behind the Yuhua God Dynasty here and then destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty. I’m quite interested in that immortal artifact. I wonder if I can obtain it!” Monster King Baiyu said to himself. His expression was still cold. The aura around him rose and became even stronger. Standing here, he had an aura of supremacy.
 In his heart, he didn’t take Lin Jiufeng seriously at all.
 So what if the trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty was a False Immortal?
 Was there a lack of False Immortals in the Myriad Races?
 Hence, Monster King Baiyu was very domineering and confident. He wanted to use this opportunity to expand the prestige of the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 On one side of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the previous rulers of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race, were gathered here. Their territory was reduced to the area here and they had given up the right to rule the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 Even though the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race had started to enter the False Immortal Realm and were beginning to recover to their peak, they were still no match for the monsters and demons from the Dreamcloud Lake.
 After Dreamcloud Lake came into being, they drove the Seven Great Sages out of the core area. However, the Dreamcloud Lake powerhouses didn’t make things difficult for them.
 Neither did they make things difficult for the Seven Great Sages nor did they take the Seven Great Sages seriously. Instead, the Dreamcloud Lake powerhouses even suppressed them a little, wanting to take them in as dogs.
 The Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race had mixed feelings when they saw the busy Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 Especially the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao.
 He had always been devoted to making the monster race stand up again, and he had worked hard for this.
 Now, the monster race had indeed stood up. However, it was different from what he had imagined.
 The emergence of the various ancient races completely divided the Monster Race. In the past, the different races would help each other. They were all from the Monster Race and weren’t differentiated from each other. When they came to the Hundred Thousand Mountains, they could cultivate and live quietly.
 But now, the different races within the Monster Race were separated. When the Myriad Races descended into this world of great competition, they immediately destroyed the old order and created a new order.
 During this period, countless monsters died.
 If it weren’t for the Seven Great Sages relying on this huge amount of spiritual energy and recovering their strength to the False Immortal Realm, they would have long been forcefully taken in by the Dreamcloud Lake Race.
 But even so, they were still pushed to the side by the Dreamcloud Lake Race.
 If it weren’t for the fact that they were busy with the convention of the Myriad Races, the Dreamcloud Lake Race would definitely have forced the Seven Great Sages to join them.
 This made the Seven Great Sages very depressed.
 The development of the situation was completely different from what they had imagined.
 Demon King Jiao, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, said angrily, “If I had known that such a huge race would come out, I wouldn’t have worked so hard.”
 When Dreamcloud Lake was still sealed, the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race paid a lot of effort to compete with Miss Hong in breaking the array formation that Miss Hong had meticulously set up. Although they ultimately gave up on continuing because of Lin Jiufeng’s arrival, this couldn’t erase the efforts they had put in.
 But after Dreamcloud Lake appeared, they naturally took over the Hundred Thousand Mountains and drove the Seven Great Sages to the side, ignoring them.
 How could Demon King Jiao not be angry?
 The other Great Sages smiled bitterly.
 “We should have thought of this long ago. In reality, this matter is different from what we thought. We should have expected it.” Demon King Dapeng, who had suffered a blow this time, began to reflect on himself.
 “This matter is a lesson to us. Now that the Myriad Races have descended, the living environment of the Monster Race is indeed better. Our initial wishes have also been fulfilled. As for the control of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, let’s just let it go. Let’s change places and cultivate diligently. The sooner we become true immortals, the sooner we can escape the title of False Immortal,” said the Great Sage of the Moving Mountain, Demon King Gui.
 “But I’m unwilling to accept this,” Demon King Jiao said in a low voice.
 “The Dreamcloud Lake Race is very powerful. Even if we recover to our peak, we are still no match for them. They are an ancient race from 15,000 years ago, and we are only from the Monster Race from thousands of years ago. The gap between us isn’t small at all. We can’t defeat them,” Demon King Pingtian said.
 “Then, we should just give up the Hundred Thousand Mountains to them?” The Great Sage of the Dreaming, Yun Shanhai, asked indignantly. He was also unwilling to give up.
 “There are two sides to everything. Whether this Hundred Thousand Mountains exists or not will depend on the situation three days later,” the Great Sage of the White Clothed, Bai Zilong, said.
 “What do you mean by that?” Demon King Dapeng asked in puzzlement.
 “You don’t think that the Yuhua God Dynasty can suppress the Myriad Races and defeat the powerhouses of these ancient races by sending just one person, do you?” Demon King Dapeng shook his head in extreme disdain.
 “We all know who the Yuhua God Dynasty will send. He’s not a person who has recovered from past eras. He’s not someone from thousands of years ago, nor is he someone from tens of thousands of years ago. He’s from this era. Even if he’s the best of this era and the so-called Son of Destiny, he won’t be able to defy the heavens and change his fate. Even with a cultivation base at the False Immortal Realm, it’s also not possible,” Demon King Jiao gritted his teeth and said.
 He was really afraid of Lin Jiufeng.
 It wasn’t hatred, because Demon King Jiao didn’t dare to hate. He was just afraid of Lin Jiufeng, a fear that came from his bones.
 But even so, he didn’t think that Lin Jiufeng would win in the convention of the Myriad Races.
 Because this was impossible.
 Demon King Pingtian said, “But I believe otherwise. I think that he will definitely stand out in this convention of the Myriad Races and let the world know of his existence. He is the top existence in this era!”
 “You’ve been brainwashed by this person,” Demon King Jiao said impolitely.
 “Do you want to make a bet?” Demon King Pingtian looked at Demon King Jiao.
 “What bet?” Demon King Jiao looked at Demon King Pingtian without showing any weakness.
 “He will suppress the Myriad Races in the convention and defeat them,” Demon King Pingtian said.
 Demon King Jiao only sneered.
 “Bet on what?” Bai Zilong looked at them curiously.
 “If you lose, leave the Hundred Thousand Mountains with us and go join the Yuhua God Dynasty!” Demon King Pingtian said.
 Demon King Jiao’s face turned angry. “You want me to join the Human Race?”
 The other five monsters and demons had different looks on their faces.
 Some were angry, some thought calmly, and some agreed with this statement.
 “It’s just a bet. You don’t dare to bet?” Demon King Pingtian asked calmly.
 “Why wouldn’t I dare?” Demon King Jiao laughed from extreme anger. “I don’t believe that the Myriad Races that ruled the world 15,000 years ago would actually lose to a single person. It’s simply a joke!”
 “If you lose, what’s the price?” Demon King Jiao asked Demon King Pingtian coldly.
 “I’ll do whatever you say. I have no objections, I’ll listen to you,” Demon King Pingtian said calmly.
 “Alright, it’s a deal!” Demon King Jiao agreed without hesitation.
 “This is a bet that I will definitely win, but you still dare to bet with me? You’re simply seeking humiliation!” Demon King Jiao said coldly.
 Demon King Pingtian didn’t refute him. Instead, he looked at the others and asked, “Do the rest of you want to join in the bet?”
 “Let’s join too.”
 “If the person behind the scenes of the Yuhua God Dynasty really wins, joining the Yuhua God Dynasty isn’t something unacceptable.”
 “Demon King Pingtian, you are very confident in this person?”
 “That’s right. Your confidence is too blind.”
 “Although I agree to join the Yuhua God Dynasty, I also don’t believe that he can suppress the Myriad Races. I even think that it will be a miracle if he isn’t killed by the Myriad Races.”
 Demon King Dapeng, Demon King Gui, Demon King Yuan, Bai Zilong, and Yun Shanhai all spoke one after another. None of them believed in Demon King Pingtian.
 “No matter how much I say now, you guys won’t believe me. I once saw his growth with my own eyes. That speed of his growth simply exceeded my expectations. Therefore, I firmly believe in him this time. Anyway, it’s just three days. Let’s see the result in three days’ time.” Demon King Pingtian didn’t explain and only fixed the bet.
 “Let’s see how you lose.” Demon King Jiao snorted coldly.
 Demon King Pingtian smiled without saying anything.
 …
 In the Kunlun Mountains, the people of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons were gathered together.
 “How many people are we sending to participate in this convention?” A False Immortal asked.
 “There are so many people at the convention of the Myriad Races. Just send two False Immortals over to show our presence, but don’t do anything,” Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 “Why not? If the Nest of 10,000 Dragons kills the Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty this time, the reputation of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons will instantly spread throughout the world. Whether it’s recovering the 10,000 Dragon God Dynasty from 15,000 years ago or occupying territory and becoming a sacred land, we will benefit greatly.” Huang Xian’er didn’t understand Big Sister Divine Silkworm’s decision.
 “That’s right, Miss Divine Silkworm. If we don’t make a move and just be a bystander, wouldn’t we be letting the people of the Primordial God Mountain stand out?” A False Immortal asked, puzzled.
 “Initially, the people of the Primordial God Mountain had already made a name for themselves during this period of time. King Invincible appeared and organized the convention of the Myriad Races, becoming famous in the world. Is our Nest of 10,000 Dragons not going to do anything?”
 “Even though our top powerhouses, those False Immortal big shots who have transcended four to five lightning tribulations, have yet to come into being, we shouldn’t be afraid of the people of the Primordial God Dynasty.”
 “If the Primordial God Dynasty really destroys the Yuhua God Dynasty this time, it will definitely not be a good thing for our Nest of 10,000 Dragons.”
 The False Immortals of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons discussed and expressed their opinions. They felt that Miss Divine Silkworm’s actions were too frustrating for them.
 If it weren’t for the fact that Big Sister Divine Silkworm’s status was extremely high, they definitely wouldn’t have listened.
 “Is the Yuhua God Dynasty that easy to destroy?” Sister Divine Silkworm asked calmly.
 “Big Sister Divine Silkworm, what do you mean by that? You still think highly of the Yuhua God Dynasty?” Huang Xian’er asked, puzzled. She didn’t know why she still thought highly of the Yuhua God Dynasty. It was obvious that the Yuhua God Dynasty was going to be destroyed.
 “That Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty isn’t simple. The convention of the Myriad Races won’t be as you guys think. You have to observe carefully instead of just following the crowd. If the Yuhua God Dynasty was really that easy to destroy, it wouldn’t have suppressed the world and ruled billions of people now,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm explained.
 “Moreover, since the Primordial God Mountain is willing to take the lead, then let them be. This time, the Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely erupt with unprecedented strength. Let the Primordial God Mountain probe out the trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty. To us, there are only benefits and no harm. We will just lose some prestige, but this little thing can be ignored. Don’t you guys know how to think on your own?” Big Sister Divine Silkworm looked at the people in front of her and shook her head helplessly.
 They didn’t even know how to weigh the pros and cons.
 All they knew was to stare at the surface of the matter, their brains impulsively calculating the small gains and losses.
 “Big Sister Divine Silkworm, are you saying that the Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely withstand the pressure of the convention of the Myriad Races?” Huang Xian’er asked suspiciously.
 “Not necessarily. I didn’t say that.” Big Sister Divine Silkworm shook her head.
 “I’m just saying that those people from the Primordial God Mountain want to destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty and establish their might, but they are thinking too simply. The Yuhua God Dynasty definitely has a trump card. That immortal artifact is also not as simple as they think. Even if the Primordial God Mountain wiped out the Yuhua God Dynasty, they would definitely pay a terrible price. It’s not as simple as they think,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 As soon as these words came out, everyone began to think.
 Big Sister Divine Silkworm’s words seemed to be right.
 “For that little bit of reputation, taking such a huge risk isn’t worth it at all. This is also the reason why I didn’t let you guys make a move. I reckon that it isn’t just us this time. There are also many other ancient races who will watch the show and choose to be a bystander. The people who will really make a move are the Primordial God Mountain and Dreamcloud Lake. Plus some other brainless False Immortals,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said disdainfully.
 Huang Xian’er finally understood that there was also this level of consideration.
 “Next, we just need to watch the show, that’s all,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said.
 …
 Three days passed in a flash!
 The preparations for the convention of the Myriad Races were almost done. At this moment, the eyes of everyone in the world were cast here.
 In the ordinary alleys, streets, and restaurants, countless people were discussing how powerful this convention that was arranged by the Myriad Races would be.
 Some storytellers made up stories from the news they had heard and told them to others. The more ridiculous and strange their stories, the more the number of people who listened.
 Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 A small path was opened up into a huge basin surrounded by mountains on all sides. The scenery along the way was very beautiful.
 In just three days, the place looked brand new. It had been renovated to the point that the peaks of the mountains were surrounded by auspicious energy. The auspicious soil was accompanied by a rosy glow, and the lake in the distance was shrouded in mist.
 Looking into the distance, there was no lack of majestic auras in the beautiful mountains and rivers. There was a 3,000 feet silver waterfall that flowed straight down. There were 8,000 feet tall mountains that pierced straight into the clouds, like a majestic immortal realm.
 Together, the scenery was picturesque, adding to the atmosphere of the convention.
 In the convention of the Myriad Races, there was the sound of a zither. In the mountains, in the ancient forest, on the shore of the lakes, there was auspicious light lingering. Mist rose and a hundred birds flew together in a peaceful manner.
 But this was just the surface. It looked peaceful and beautiful.
 But no one in the world believed that what they saw was all there was to it.
 On this day, after the sun rose, everyone in the world watched this place.
 All the major factions, ancient races, aristocratic families, and the God Dynasty were watching.
 Boom!
 An extremely terrifying aura descended, sweeping across the sky and earth. Accompanied by a thunderous sound, a few figures walked over from the intersection of heaven and earth.
 All of them were tall and incomparably majestic. They were like small mountains, extremely oppressive as if they could crush this world.
 These people were all False Immortals, and they were all from the same ancient race.
 Primordial God Mountain!
 They walked very slowly, but their auras were quite terrifying. Each of them seemed to have experienced thousands of disasters, making them eternal and indestructible. They were in harmony with the world and integrated into the Great Dao.
 There were a total of nine of them!
 Nine False Immortals!
 For the sake of this convention of the Myriad Races, the Primordial God Mountain gave it its all. It took out nine False Immortals at once. Moreover, these nine False Immortals had all experienced lightning tribulation.
 Their cultivation base wasn’t as hollow as those who had just entered the False Immortal Realm, but someone who had undergone the baptism of lightning tribulation.
 They came together and walked together. Their terrifying and powerful auras almost made the ground sink. At this moment, a bell sounded in the sky. No one knew who rang it, but this bell was sounded for these nine False Immortals.
 They walked over. In the early sunlight, they were drowned by a blazing light. Each of them was covered in a layer of golden light.
 Among the nine, the leader was King Invincible. He had the appearance of a human. His face was cold and his body seemed to be gilded, sparking in the light. The only thing that was special about him was a pair of huge wings on his back, representing that he wasn’t a human.
 King Invincible brought the eight False Immortals to the front of the convention. Looking at the convention of the Myriad Races that had no humans, he sneered. “Don’t tell me that person from the Yuhua God Dynasty is hiding in fear?”
 The eight False Immortals behind King Invincible had cold looks on their faces. They didn’t even take a glance at this so-called convention of the Myriad Races. As for the countless pairs of eyes watching from the surroundings. they were just ants in their eyes.
 Boom!
 From the Dreamcloud Lake Race, a False Immortal also came out. It was a black crow. He sneered and said, “What right does the Human Race have to be compared to the Myriad Races? They are just taking advantage of the time that we have disappeared. Now that we have returned, what right do they have to discuss the world with us?”
 As soon as these words came out, the various major factions in the world felt aggrieved. These Myriad Races were too domineering, looking down on the humans.
 Even those factions that were at odds with the Yuhua God Dynasty frowned at this moment.
 But they didn’t even dare to be angry. The gap between them and the Myriad Races was too huge. They felt slightly sad in their hearts. The arrogance of the Myriad Races towards the Human Race came from their hearts. They just felt that the Human Race wasn’t good enough.
 Even if there was a Yuhua God Dynasty that could suppress the world, it was still not enough.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty suppressed the world while the Myriad Races weren’t around.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty had an immortal artifact that had displayed its might, but the Myriad Races were still unafraid.
 The words of the False Immortals of the Primordial God Mountain and the Dreamcloud Lake now could be said to be very cruel, but no one from the Human Race dared to stand out and oppose.
 Standing out meant going to war with the Myriad Races. No one had the courage to do so.
 Even the various Demon Sects that had always yearned for the death of the Yuhua God Dynasty fell silent at this moment.
 The people from the Primordial God Mountain and Dreamcloud Lake were very arrogant. As for the people from the other ancient races, they all stood aside without saying anything. Just as Big Sister Divine Silkworm had said, they were just watching the show.
 They would let the people from the Primordial God Mountain and Dreamcloud Lake take the lead.
 “The convention of the Myriad Races is just a joke. Is there anyone of the Human Race who is on the same level as us? That person from the Yuhua God Dynasty hasn’t appeared until now. Does he plan to hide for the rest of his life?” King Invincible smiled disdainfully and said.
 “If he doesn’t appear today, the next step will be to slaughter half of the Human Race. There are too many humans now,” Black Crow of the Dreamcloud Lake Race smiled cruelly and said.
 Countless humans heard this. They gnashed their teeth in anger, but they also felt despair.
 After the people from the two ancient races, the Primordial God Mountain and the Dreamcloud Lake, had appeared, there were already more than ten False Immortals. This wasn’t even counting those who were just watching the show. But the Yuhua God Dynasty only had one person who was supposed to come here. How was this person supposed to fight?
 How could he resist?
 The key was that this person still hadn’t appeared.
 Everyone in the world was paying attention to this battle, and they were also looking forward to Lin Jiufeng’s arrival.
 They looked forward to it.
 Right now, the auras of the Myriad Races were too domineering, suppressing the Human Race until they couldn’t breathe. No one dared to oppose the Myriad Races.
 The major factions from thousands of years ago didn’t dare to do so.
 In the entire world, there was only the Yuhua God Dynasty who dared to.
 Dong!
 Right at this moment, under the expectant gazes of everyone, countless people, and the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty…
 A sound of footsteps came from the ends of heaven and earth.
 This sound of footsteps seemed to have combined with the pulse of this world. Stepping on the ground was like stepping on everyone’s hearts, making them excited. Everyone couldn’t help but look over.
 A clear and peerless scene was imprinted in the hearts of countless people.
 The rising sun slowly climbed out of the mountaintop. It scattered golden multicolored light that filled the sky, dying the ground with a golden halo. It was magnificent.
 And at the ends of heaven and earth in the distance, a carriage slowly drove over, then stopped. A tall and straight figure opened the curtain and walked out. Then, he took a step forward and walked over calmly.
 In the eyes of the people, he was dressed in snow-white clothes. His figure was slender, handsome, and tall as he walked firmly towards the convention of the Myriad Races.
 This was a False Immortal!
 His aura alone wasn’t inferior to the combined auras of the nine False Immortals of the Primordial God Mountain.
 He walked out of the blazing sun and draped on the red robe that the sun of the mortal world had scattered on him, adding a layer of holy brilliance to him.
 His entire being didn’t have a soul-stirring aura, but dressed in white, he looked otherworldly. Under the gaze of the Myriad Races, he walked over steadily. His face was handsome and his temperament was peerless!
 The person behind the scenes of the Yuhua God Dynasty!
 The Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty that everyone talked about was actually so handsome and almost immortal-like. Countless human cultivators watching actually cried at this moment. It wasn’t known whether they were excited, happy, or aggrieved, but hot tears flowed down their faces.
 In this era, with the recovery of spiritual energy, the Human Race had always been aggrieved.
 Be it the major factions from thousands of years ago or the Myriad Races from 10,000 years ago, the people of this era didn’t have many feelings for them.
 They were like outsiders who had descended into this era, bringing them endless chaos and snatching countless resources.
 Only the Yuhua God Dynasty, the God Dynasty that was born and raised in this era, was the support of the common people. The people of the world had been ruled by the Yuhua God Dynasty for hundreds of years, generation after generation. Till now, the Yuhua God Dynasty was improving by the day and suppressing the world.
 The people of the world had a special sense of intimacy with the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 And now, this sense of intimacy made all the humans of this era cry in excitement upon seeing Lin Jiufeng, who descended into this world like an immortal.
 The Human Race had hopes of being saved now.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty could also be saved.
 All this time, the Patriarch who had only existed in everyone’s mouths, the supporter of the Yuhua God Dynasty, had walked out of the darkness and stood in front of everyone.
 The first thing he faced was the convention of the Myriad Races.
 Mainly the two ancient races, the Primordial God Mountain and the Dreamcloud Lake.
 There were also the ancient races who were silently observing.
 Hundreds of False Immortals descended into the world, but the Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty still walked over firmly.
 He walked out of the sun, bringing with him hope.
 At this moment, Lin Jiufeng arrived in front of the convention of the Myriad Races. He stood there, blending with the world as his aura rose infinitely.
 He was dressed in white and stood tall without a speck of dust. He looked extraordinary.
 “Lin Jiufeng from the Human Race has come to kill you all!” His handsome face, determined expression, and peerless charm made him look like an immortal king who had descended into this mortal realm. But the words that he said caused an uproar in the world.
 Confident!
 Arrogant!
 Wasn’t the Myriad Races arrogant?
 Then, he would be even more arrogant than them!
 He was here to kill them all.
 The group of them was surrounded by him alone!

                    



 Chapter 252: There Is A Disparity Even Among False Immortals!  
 Lin Jiufeng descended here, bringing with him a myriad of lights. He faced the False Immortals of the Primordial God Mountain and Dreamcloud Lake alone with a calm expression. Behind him, a little white cat followed. She controlled the carriage and walked to the side, watching silently.
 The white cat stood on top of the horse’s head and controlled it. The horse would stop and move according to her will.
 ?
 “You must win!” The white cat watched firmly. She believed in Lin Jiufeng and believed that he would definitely succeed.
 In this world, no one could defeat Lin Jiufeng.
 This was the white cat’s blind confidence in Lin Jiufeng.
 As for the people of the world, they were shocked by Lin Jiufeng’s confidence. The shock he brought to the world was no less than the emergence of the Myriad Races.
 The Human Race also had such a powerful, terrifying, and confident False Immortal?
 He wasn’t a False Immortal of the previous era, nor the False Immortal of 10,000 years ago.
 He was the number one immortal of this era!
 Upon hearing Lin Jiufeng’s arrogant words, King Invincible sneered. “You are just a False Immortal who has transcended lightning tribulation once. You are only at the Opening of the Three Flowers stage, yet you still dare to spout nonsense here?”
 “Lin Jiufeng, the convention of the Myriad Races has already begun. Can you represent the Yuhua God Dynasty?” Dreamcloud Lake’s King Black Crow shouted coldly.
 “Me coming here is enough to prove everything!” Lin Jiufeng said calmly. There was spirit in his eyes, like the rising sun. They were sparkling and filled with a lively aura.
 This calmness also carried a sense of composure. He didn’t place the pressure of the Myriad Races in front of him in his eyes. Lin Jiufeng was like a god that had descended into the world, looking down on the Myriad Races.
 “You came alone with the immortal artifact?” Monster King Baiyu stood up and asked coldly.
 “Against you lot, there’s no need for the immortal artifact to leave the imperial capital!” Lin Jiufeng replied seriously.
 Monster King Baiyu’s face darkened. He was quite angry. Wasn’t this looking down on them too much?
 The people of the world were in an uproar. The meaning of these words was obvious. The Yuhua God Dynasty didn’t even bring out the immortal artifact to deal with the Myriad Races that had amassed a huge force here.
 “Aren’t you too arrogant?” King Invincible was so angry that he laughed. He stared at Lin Jiufeng, coldness flickering in his eyes. He was about to attack at any moment.
 He really wanted to kill Lin Jiufeng. This was too arrogant.
 “The era has long been different. You lot have been abandoned by the world for 15,000 years. The gap between the world now and 10,000 years ago is too big, so even if we are all False Immortals, there’s still a difference in strength between us!” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “In this world, every immortal who achieves the Dao is unique!” Lin Jiufeng said. His expression was very calm as he shared the truth.
 15,000 years ago, there was no spiritual energy tide yet. Everything was at its peak then. The Great Dao was also very easy to comprehend. It was much easier to become a False Immortal during that era as compared to now.
 When it came to this world, the spiritual energy had just recovered and the Great Dao had yet to be revealed. Everything was so difficult.
 All those who became False Immortals in this era were unique!
 These words were like a thunderclap, making the pupils of King Invincible shrink. It also made the faces of all the False Immortals of the Myriad Races change.
 The era was different, and the world at that time couldn’t be compared to now. Before this era, the spiritual energy was thin, and the difficulty of comprehending the Dao made countless talented cultivators despair.
 Some people were talented but couldn’t break through, being imprisoned by heaven and earth. They could only grow old and watch their hair turn white. They were sad and angry, wishing to defy the heavens.
 Even now, with the recovery of spiritual energy and easier cultivation, it was still much more difficult than 15,000 years ago.
 These were all part of the changes of the world!
 The pride of the Myriad Races was shattered by Lin Jiufeng at this moment.
 “The era is different, but the False Immortal Realm is the same. You won’t be our match!” King Invincible gritted his teeth. He refused to admit this fact.
 “I’ll kill you now and let you know that although the times are different, you and I are the same!” King Invincible didn’t waste time talking more. He shouted coldly and then attacked decisively.
 Behind him, a pair of black wings burst out with a bang. Endless energy surged together.
 Boom!
 This strike was extremely terrifying. It was like the sun and moon in the sky. A pair of wings that contained infinite energy burst out and gathered into a divine sword that seemed to come from 15,000 years ago. It shuttled through time and came to the present and struck down.
 He wanted to kill Lin Jiufeng on the spot and let him know that the people from 15,000 years ago were definitely stronger than the people from today!
 The energy of this strike surged continuously, condensing into the body of the sword. But the astral energy outside the body of the sword was condensed from the Boundless God Technique that the King Invincible had comprehended. It was his strongest strike.
 At this moment, his cultivation base at the second stage of the False Immortal Realm was undoubtedly revealed. The strength of his Opening of the Three Flowers and Forming of the Five Energies erupted too.
 King Invincible wanted to kill Lin Jiufeng in one strike and finish the battle.
 If he lived, Lin Jiufeng would die!
 Rumble!
 This sword was extremely huge. After it slashed out, it was as if this terrifying sword energy was the only thing in the world. It cleansed the clouds and split the space. Wherever it passed, chaos lingered. It was very terrifying.
 In the morning sun, Lin Jiufeng’s entire body was shrouded by the light of the rising sun. The light was like golden holy light, like the light of human nature that shrouded him under the gaze of the billions of people of the world.
 Lin Jiufeng only made one move, and that was to slash with his finger.
 Clang!
 A sword that came from 15,000 years ago slashed down with a supreme might.
 But now, it was directly broken under Lin Jiufeng’s finger. The vast divine aura of the sword energy instantly dissipated like a violent wind, spreading in all directions. It then transformed into a chaotic storm that surged in all directions.
 This terrifying aura scared the other people of the Myriad Races into retreating one after another, watching in surprise.
 Boom!
 This sword that transmigrated through space was easily cut apart by Lin Jiufeng at this moment. This made King Invincible’s eyes narrow. He shouted without hesitation, “Attack together!”
 He realized that Lin Jiufeng wasn’t someone to be trifled with.
 It wasn’t just him. The others also saw that Lin Jiufeng wasn’t someone to be trifled with.
 From this finger, they saw the difference between the False Immortals of this era and the False Immortals of 15,000 years ago.
 Hence, the eight False Immortals who came with King Invincible didn’t hesitate to attack. They rushed over together towards their target, Lin Jiufeng.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 At this moment, a terrifying battle began. This time, a total of nine False Immortals attacked together. They were all from the Primordial God Mountain. The nine of them weren’t weak. Moreover, they attacked together, wanting to kill Lin Jiufeng.
 In an instant, the world rumbled. The Great Dao swept and millions of auspicious lights burst forth. The energy tide surged, sweeping up the winds and clouds in all directions.
 Thousands of strands of auspicious light, paired with various divine lights, interweaved together, turning into strands of immortal light that slashed down.
 These attacks carried an unparalleled might!
 The eyes of everyone in the world trembled. This was too shocking, it didn’t seem like a mortal’s attack at all.
 At this moment, a False Immortal charged forward. His speed was superb. He raised his hand and a large area of Heavenly Dao killing intent rose from all directions. Accompanied by various auspicious energies surging, it drooped down and transformed into a white jade disc that smashed down ruthlessly.
 Dong!
 But Lin Jiufeng’s eyes were bright. He moved his body, formed a fist with one hand, and smashed down. A resplendent light erupted. Six dark holes appeared behind him. This was the Six Paths of Reincarnation Fist.
 Pu!
 Lin Jiufeng showed no mercy when this punch was thrown. A False Immortal who had just undergone one lightning tribulation like him also dared to behave atrociously in front of him?
 When the power of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Fist exploded, it dyed the world black. Lin Jiufeng was dressed in white as if he was the only light in the world. With this punch, a power that surged to the point of making one tremble erupted, causing the world to resonate and rumble incessantly.
 It directly smashed down.
 Facing Lin Jiufeng’s punch, the expression of this False Immortal who had executed the white jade disc changed. He wanted to escape, but how could he escape Lin Jiufeng’s Six Paths of Reincarnation Fist?
 Boom!
 Amidst a resplendent light, Lin Jiufeng’s black fist broke the white jade disc and shattered all the light of this False Immortal. The powerful force crushed his attack. He was completely no match for Lin Jiufeng. He directly dropped into the air.
 Pu!
 This punch caused the white jade disc to explode. This False Immortal also let out a tragic cry and then his entire body exploded too.
 “No…” This False Immortal of the Primordial God Mountain shouted in surprise and anger. After his body exploded, his Primordial Spirit that had already transcended the tribulation wanted to escape, but it was swept by the subsequent power of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Fist.
 Without any surprise, it was like sweeping the floor and meeting an ant, crushing over it with a rumbling sound as the ant died.
 At this moment, the False Immortal’s screams stopped.
 In front of Lin Jiufeng, blood rained down from the sky. Then, it transformed into crimson light that burned. It burned and collapsed the entire sky, constantly destroying it and turning it into a dilapidated place.
 This was the first False Immortal to perish in the convention of the Myriad Races!
 The one who died wasn’t the Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty like the powerhouses of the world had guessed, but the False Immortal of the Primordial God Mountain that had always behaved arrogantly in front of the world.
 Lin Jiufeng, who was thought to be seeking death by Myriad Races, was standing in the sky at this moment. He carried the gaze of the people of the world on his back as he welcomed the rain of blood. His white clothes were as usual, and his expression didn’t change at all.
 In the blink of an eye, Lin Jiufeng used absolute strength to compete with heaven and earth for good fortune and compete with the sun and moon for brilliance. A cold killing intent burst out from him and directly killed a False Immortal, stunning the other eight people.
 “Both of you are at the Opening of the Three Flowers stage. How can you be so powerful and kill a False Immortal of the same stage?” King Invincible couldn’t hide his surprise as he asked in disbelief.
 Even though he had transcended two lightning tribulations, he couldn’t kill a False Immortal at the Opening of the Three Flowers stage so easily.
 “There is also a disparity even between False Immortals!” Lin Jiufeng replied calmly. He took a step forward. At this moment, it wasn’t the other party who attacked him, but it was Lin Jiufeng who took the initiative to attack.
 Having been in this world for 100 years, this was the first time Lin Jiufeng had displayed his full strength in front of the world.
 “Boundless Calamity, exist in my body, an invincible move, forever suppress!” Lin Jiufeng chanted softly. His voice reverberated through the sky and earth. Accompanied by the wind and clouds, it rumbled like thunder. It was unknown how many tens of thousands of miles it spread, but everyone in the world seemed to have heard it.
 A sword case appeared in his palm, and he pulled out a treasure sword that he had received from signing in.
 Monster Slaying Sword!
 He slashed out with his sword.
 Clang!
 At this moment, the sword energy spread for thousands of miles and lit up the world. Wherever it passed, all obstacles disappeared.
 In front of the sword energy, the void was collapsing and the light of chaos was faintly visible.
 This strike of Lin Jiufeng actually forcefully split out a small world, causing the void to have an aura of a newly created world.
 This was Lin Jiufeng’s might. His sword technique was definitely a peerlessly powerful attack. Accompanied by the Monster Slaying Sword, it was like adding wings to a tiger.
 At this moment, under the sword light, auspicious colors and divine lotuses appeared on the ground. A small world appeared, but it was instantly destroyed. It erupted with an extremely terrifying power and charged out.
 The various lights gathered together, forming a sea of sword energies!
 Everyone who was watching all of this in the surroundings watched in surprise at that huge pressure. Even those who weren’t attacked couldn’t withstand the pressure in the sky. The world seemed to have been destroyed.
 This was too terrifying!
 At this moment, Lin Jiufeng gave the world a surprise with this sword strike.
 It also gave the Myriad Races a fright.
 King Invincible roared. He gathered all the strength in his body and moved his hands. He used all his strength to execute his ultimate technique, the supreme immortal technique from the Primordial God Mountain.
 At this moment, time seemed to have stopped for him. His expression was ugly. Withstanding the huge pressure, his eyes were firm as his hands drew trajectories.
 He was executing a terrifying Dao.
 But that was all!
 In front of Lin Jiufeng, he was completely no match for him.
 It wasn’t just him. There were also the seven False Immortals beside him. They were all at the Opening of the Three Flowers or the Forming of the Five Energies stage. Facing Lin Jiufeng’s sword strike, they tried their best, but it was useless.
 Lin Jiufeng’s strike was divine and vast, filling the sky. On the Monster Slaying Sword, there were ancient patterns like divine birds, the sun, hybrid beast, horned dragon, and so on carved on it. They were all monsters that had been killed by the Monster Slaying Sword in the past.
 The Monster Slaying Sword was a peerless magic treasure. Lin Jiufeng didn’t know if it was an immortal artifact because its might wasn’t fully activated yet. It wasn’t like the [Light of the Homes] that would automatically recover. Lin Jiufeng’s current strength was indeed powerful, but he was unable to make the core of the Monster Slaying Sword recover and release its true might.
 But this couldn’t hide the might and terrifying power of the Monster Slaying Sword.
 The world was shocked by this strike!
 At this moment, the clouds of dawn were resplendent, blooming beautifully like blood. The endless sword energy carried the light of various nomological interweavings. It let out a deafening roar and suppressed down, unstoppable!
 Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu!
 The Monster Slaying Sword’s sword energy suppressed King Invincible and the others. Their actions, their resistance, their counterattacks, their escape…
 At this moment, it all became useless.
 Their heads were instantly separated from their bodies. Blood spurted out like pillars, accompanied by the crimson glow and the god-like aura on the sword energy.
 The group from the Primordial God Mountain perished!
 At this moment, the rumbling of the Great Dao lingered in the air.
 The world was a vast expanse of whiteness. There were sword lights everywhere, and the nomological powers of the Sword Dao were everywhere. The Monster Slaying Sword, which seemed to be as huge as a mountain, illuminated the sky as if it was also illuminating the path ahead of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Eight False Immortals died under this one strike. That terrifying and crazy energy burned.
 Terrifying energy rushed into the sky. The corpses and divine souls of the eight False Immortals were among them. All sorts of Great Dao nomological powers dissipated. The Great Dao that they had comprehended after working hard for half their lives rushed out one after another, becoming a chaotic flow of energy that threw the void into chaos. No one dared to intervene.
 They could only wait for it to disappear on its own.
 Lin Jiufeng stood in the air. He placed the Monster Slaying Sword back into the sword case and looked at the other False Immortals of the Myriad Races.
 At this moment, no one dared to look him in the eye.
 Even the powerful Monster King Baiyu frowned. He opened his mouth in shock, not knowing what to say.
 One strike!
 He only used one strike to kill the eight False Immortals of the Primordial God Mountain!
 The group from the Primordial God Mountain was completely wiped out.
 The powerhouses of the Dreamcloud Lake, the powerhouses of the Myriad Races, and the powerhouses of the Human Race were all petrified at this moment.
 Was this a dream?
 Everyone looked at the vast expanse of whiteness. The sword energy had yet to dissipate. It filled the surroundings, making one tremble in fear.
 The Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty was actually so terrifying?
 This was like an illusion, it was too terrifying.
 But after being petrified, the humans erupted. Each of them looked crazy and excited as they shouted Lin Jiufeng’s name loudly.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng! Invincible in the world!”
 “It’s the blessing of the Human Race that our Yuhua God Dynasty has the Great Emperor Jiufeng!”
 “Killing the eight False Immortals with one strike, who can do this? Only Great Emperor Jiufeng can!”
 “Long live the Human Race, long live Great Emperor Jiufeng!”
 “Unrivaled in the world, the Yuhua God Dynasty shall exist forever!”
 Countless people, men, women, old, and young all went crazy. The powerful emergence of the Myriad Races made the common people of the Human Race panic. They were all apprehensive.
 But now, Lin Jiufeng’s strike shattered the pride, arrogance, and aloofness of the Myriad Races.
 It also shattered the inferiority complex of humans and the threat hanging above their heads.
 They heard Lin Jiufeng’s self-introduction.
 They spontaneously addressed Lin Jiufeng as Great Emperor Jiufeng!
 The ruler of the Yuhua God Dynasty was Emperor De, but Emperor De was just a mortal emperor.
 Lin Jiufeng was Great Emperor Jiufeng, the pillar of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The entire world was in an uproar!
 The humans were excited and happy.
 The Myriad Races were shocked, surprised, and puzzled.
 In the Hundred Thousand Mountains, in the Nest of 10,000 Dragons, Huang Xian’er and the group of False Immortals were dumbfounded.
 Even from millions of miles away, they also sensed the terrifying aspect of this sword.
 The sharpness of that sword shocked the False Immortals in the Nest of 10,000 Dragons.
 “Big Sister Divine Silkworm, you really have foresight. This False Immortal of the Yuhua God Dynasty is so terrifying and powerful!” Huang Xian’er said in shock.
 It wasn’t just her. The other False Immortals were the same.
 It was the same for Big Sister Divine Silkworm too.
 The shock in her beautiful eyes wasn’t any less. Although she had guessed that the Yuhua God Dynasty had a trump card, she absolutely didn’t expect it to be like this.
 One human, one sword.
 Just like that, the young master of the Primordial God Mountain and the other False Immortals of the Primordial God Mountain were wiped out!
 There was actually such a terrifying person in this world?
 “There is a disparity even between False Immortals!” Big Sister Divine Silkworm could only repeat Lin Jiufeng’s words.
 Yuhua God Dynasty, the imperial capital, Forbidden City.
 Emperor De, Princess Yulin, and the top existences cheered in unison at this moment. Even those who had recovered their cultivation base to the False Immortal Realm couldn’t help but be afraid of such a terrifying sword technique.
 Fortunately, this terrifying person was from the Yuhua God Dynasty. Their hearts were instantly filled with a sense of security. They followed the will of the common people of the world and called out the name of Great Emperor Jiufeng.
 When Lin Jiufeng displayed his might, near the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the Seven Great Sages watched without blinking. They were speechless.
 Including Demon King Pingtian. He did believe in Lin Jiufeng, but this was too ferocious. It far exceeded his imagination.
 This was way too terrifying.
 Demon King Jiao suddenly said, “Later on, let’s go and join the Yuhua God Dynasty. Let’s tell them that the Human Race and Monster Race can coexist without interfering with each other.”
 The other six Great Sages looked at Demon King Jiao together.
 Wasn’t he unwilling?
 Demon King Jiao coughed and said calmly, “I don’t want to withstand this strike one day. It’s too terrifying.”
 “That’s right. I suddenly look forward to the life of joining the Yuhua God Dynasty. Wouldn’t it be better if there were fewer struggles and more peace in this world?” Demon King Dapeng smiled happily and said.
 “The ideals of the Yuhua God Dynasty’s work are actually quite to my liking. Treating the common people well and treating the various races equally is quite good,” the Great Sage of the White Clothed, Bai Zilong, said in all seriousness.
 “I’ve said long ago that the Yuhua God Dynasty has ideals and ambitions. If we join, it’s guaranteed that we won’t be harmed,” the Great Sage of the Moving Mountain, Demon King Gui, said.
 Everyone looked at him.
 Their eyes were calm, but their expressions showed that they were speechless.
 “What’s wrong? Did I say anything wrong?” Demon King Gui said solemnly, “Great Emperor Jiufeng is so ferocious and handsome. He shall be my lifelong idol.”
 …
 In front of the convention of the Myriad Races, Lin Jiufeng stood in the air. With his hands clasped behind his back, he looked at the Myriad Races in front of him.
 He didn’t continue to attack. Instead, he chose to stop. His aura was completely restrained in his body, making him look like an ordinary person.
 But in the eyes of the Myriad Races and in the eyes of the people of the world, this was a kind of returning to the basics, a kind of spirit that only belonged to the peak powerhouse of the world.
 Lin Jiufeng looked down at the vast land. Wherever his gaze landed, even the False Immortals had to avoid it, not daring to come into contact with his gaze too much.
 He alone suppressed the convention of the Myriad Races!
 This was a scene that would last for eternity. No matter how many years would pass, it would be branded in the hearts of the people, unable to be forgotten.
 Great Emperor Jiufeng lived up to his name!
 “The Myriad Races are to move about in their own territories. You lot aren’t allowed to fight in the territory of the Yuhua God Dynasty. Those who violate this rule shall be killed!” Lin Jiufeng, who was dressed in white and standing alone in the air, said solemnly.

                    



 Chapter 253: Overture of the Gods  
 Over the past few days, ever since the recovery of the Myriad Races, the world seemed to have been shrouded in a black fog. The might of the Myriad Races made people unable to resist. Even the major forces from thousands of years ago seemed to be struggling and couldn’t resist at all when facing the Myriad Races.
 They chose to hide behind and push the Yuhua God Dynasty out, letting the billions of people of the Yuhua God Dynasty face the Myriad Races directly.
 ?
 The people of the world were terrified and could only place their hopes on the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 But many people were also not confident. Would the Yuhua God Dynasty be able to resist the terrifying might of the Myriad Races?
 No one could be sure.
 But now, Lin Jiufeng stood in front of the convention of the Myriad Races and said these words domineeringly. It was like a ray of light rising from the east, cutting through the night and shining into everyone’s hearts.
 Accompanied by the brilliance spat out by the red rising sun, it swept away the darkness. Amidst the morning fog, the light was dazzling. The grass that had just sprouted squeezed through the soil to welcome the new world and new era.
 The surrounding lake waves and bright flower petals were all flickering with luster. They all had a beautiful future.
 Between heaven and earth, refreshing air blew into their faces.
 In the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the morning fog lingered. Amidst the rosy clouds, there was light flickering, colorful and misty. It was beautiful and peaceful.
 Lin Jiufeng was dressed in white like an immortal. He looked at the convention of the Myriad Races, but he met with dead silence.
 He alone suppressed the Myriad Races!
 Handsome!
 Peerless in temperament!
 Such a graceful bearing gained the worship of countless people. The hearts of the young girls were moved and excited. They couldn’t wait to devote their lives to him and become his servants.
 [Do you want to Sign-In at the Convention of the Myriad Races?]
 A quiet notification appeared before Lin Jiufeng’s eyes.
 “Sign in!” Lin Jiufeng said in his heart.
 He was also quite curious. What could he sign in at such a place?
 [Sign-In successful. Received the Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens phenomenon!]
 Lin Jiufeng was overjoyed. He immediately checked the information of this phenomenon.
 Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens. This was a supreme phenomenon. In an extremely distant era, an immortal king-level powerhouse appeared out of nowhere and went against the nine heavens, killing until blood flowed in the world. On that rainy night, heaven and earth illuminated this shocking scene and passed it down to the world, creating a classic phenomenon.
 Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens!
 This was an extremely terrifying offensive phenomenon.
 Now that Lin Jiufeng had signed in successfully, it could be considered a pleasant surprise. Since ancient times, there were very few people who comprehended this phenomenon. Each person who comprehended it was an outstanding powerhouse in the world.
 After Lin Jiufeng understood this, he directly integrated this phenomenon into his God’s Domain without hesitation.
 He had four great phenomena now.
 Sea Rising Bright Moon! Great Dao Descending into the Mortal Realm! 12 Music of the Gods! Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens!
 The powerful phenomenon integrated into God’s Domain, expanding it and also increasing Lin Jiufeng’s strength greatly. He became stronger again. The second lightning tribulation was about to descend, he could cross it at any time.
 Boom!
 After the Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens phenomenon integrated into God’s Domain, the aura around Lin Jiufeng’s body sank and suddenly became stronger. His eyes lit up as he walked into the venue of the convention.
 The exquisitely decorated venue was silent. Lin Jiufeng walked in, making the Myriad Races speechless.
 Facing a powerhouse like Lin Jiufeng, Monster King Baiyu was quite angry. He looked at Lin Jiufeng coldly and said, “You killed a few False Immortals who have passed the first lightning tribulation, and you think you can resist the entire Myriad Races?”
 As soon as these words came out, everyone looked at Monster King Baiyu. Was he going to step forward and challenge Lin Jiufeng?
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the other and asked, “You aren’t convinced of my strength yet?”
 “You are indeed very powerful, but you are unable to suppress the Myriad Races alone. It’s a joke for you to think that you can support the entire human race alone!” Monster King Baiyu said coldly.
 Monster King Baiyu stood on a broken mountain that was more than 10,000 feet tall. This broken mountain was barren as if it had been cut in half by someone. The broken surface was a huge platform that was vast and boundless. Monster King Baiyu stood there alone with his aura surging. Behind him, a huge immortal crane spread its wings and flew. A resplendent light surrounded its body as it let out a sharp cry.
 As one of the few Monster Kings of Dreamcloud Lake, he was the first to come to this world. Right now, he was the only leader of Dreamcloud Lake. The other False Immortals were greatly inferior to him.
 He had already passed three lightning tribulations and reached the Aspect Golden Body stage.
 This huge immortal crane was his Aspect Golden Body.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at his huge Aspect Golden Body. Monster King Baiyu had refined this true body which was that of an immortal crane into his Aspect Golden Body, and its might was peerless. But in Lin Jiufeng’s eyes, it was just average.
 “I’m invincible in this world. I can single-handedly support the human race and also suppress all of you. If anyone is unwilling to accept this, I will suppress them. This Hundred Thousand Mountains was originally the territory of the Yuhua God Dynasty. For the sake of the coexistence of humans and monsters, the Yuhua God Dynasty gave the Hundred Thousand Mountains to the Seven Great Sages and let them lead the Monster Race to recuperate. Now that it has been occupied by your Dreamcloud Lake, the Yuhua God Dynasty naturally has to take it back,” Lin Jiufeng said as he looked at the huge Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 “What a vast land. It’s comparable to one-tenth of the Yuhua God Dynasty’s land. Your Dreamcloud Lake isn’t worthy of possessing it,” Lin Jiufeng said with emotion.
 “Insolent! The Hundred Thousand Mountains has been ruled by the Dreamcloud Lake Race since ancient times. It has been like this since 15,000 years ago!” Monster King Baiyu shouted angrily.
 “You also know that it was 15,000 years ago. How distant is that era? Today, I will let you know that the era has changed!” Lin Jiufeng looked at him and said coldly.
 “You think you can resist the dozens of False Immortals of the Dreamcloud Lake alone?” Monster King Baiyu’s subordinate, Black Crow, sneered.
 “What do you think you are? You didn’t dare to look directly at me just now, but now, you dare to behave atrociously in front of me?” Lin Jiufeng swept a cold glance. His gaze was like a torch as the God’s Domain around him began to spread.
 Boom!
 The God’s Domain spread, and the Great Dao Descending into the Mortal Realm phenomenon inside erupted.
 The temperature dropped rapidly, and cold killing intent filled the air.
 Then, the Great Dao that fell into the mortal realm transformed into surging waves that swept out. Black Crow was a False Immortal who had transcended one lightning tribulation. But at this moment, its body exploded. In Lin Jiufeng’s God’s Domain, under the Great Dao phenomenon, it had no power to resist at all.
 Boom!
 Black Crow’s body was struck and directly exploded, shattering into pieces. Blood flew everywhere, turning into endless blood light that completely dyed the cliff where Monster King Baiyu was at.
 “How dare you!!” Monster King Baiyu was enraged. His aura was like lightning as it spread in all directions. He didn’t expect Lin Jiufeng to be so decisive as to kill a general under his command right under his nose.
 At this moment, the enraged Monster King Baiyu looked at Lin Jiufeng with overflowing killing intent.
 At this moment, the cold wind blew on everyone’s faces. Looking at the scarlet blood and the shattered corpse that stained the cliff red, they couldn’t help but hold their breath, afraid of disturbing the two people on the scene.
 Lin Jiufeng stood alone in the center of the convention of the Myriad Races. Wearing white clothes, he looked otherworldly, without a trace of blood on them. It was terrifying.
 But this also caused Monster King Baiyu to be unable to restrain his anger. His magic power erupted, and his vital energy, True Qi, and divine soul surged like a divine sea, drowning the entire world. He glared at Lin Jiufeng and shouted, “I’ll come and kill you right now!”
 “I don’t believe that without you, the human race can still continue to rule this world.” Monster King Baiyu reached out and gripped the air. A spear appeared out of thin air. It was crimson red, like the color of blood. It also looked like it had been taken out of magma. A horned dragon was carved on it. The dragon was very powerful-looking and entangled on the spear as if it was alive. It was very powerful.
 Pu! Pu! Pu!
 At this moment, Monster King Baiyu held the long spear in his hand and pointed it at Lin Jiufeng from a distance. His aura was peerless. A bright red waterfall spat out from the long spear, turning into a horned dragon that swam in the air, captivating one’s soul.
 Carrying the huge immortal crane on his back, which was his Aspect Golden Body, and a powerful magic treasure in hand, Monster King Baiyu’s aura was incomparably sharp at this moment. He directly charged over.
 “I’m here to kill you!” Monster King Baiyu stepped on the void and attacked with a powerful aura.
 At this moment, his killing intent was so heavy that it became tangible.
 Lin Jiufeng watched as the other party charged over. He didn’t move at all. Instead, Lin Jiufeng’s attitude was cold, like the wind. In his God’s Domain, he was God. Suddenly, he let out a sigh.
 A piece of music suddenly sounded in the world. The sound was leisurely and spread for thousands of miles.
 Boom!
 In God’s Domain, outside the world, terrifying energy descended, bringing with it an incomparably resplendent halo that lingered in the surroundings.
 Ding dong!
 This was a piece of music.
 An ancient piece of music, a piece forgotten by the world.
 It came from a very, very long time ago. It should be even older than the era of the 10,000 races.
 The music was very pleasant to listen to as if someone had played it in the distant past and descended into this world with the radiance of the gods.
 First Music of the 12 Music of the Gods: “Overture of the Gods”!
 At this moment, in God’s Domain, some phantoms appeared in front of Lin Jiufeng. They were muddled and his appearance couldn’t be seen clearly, but they were playing the music that belonged to the gods.
 The 12 Music of the Gods that Lin Jiufeng had signed in was executed for the first time. With an extremely terrifying power, it shook the entire scene.
 The music sounded. Terrifying phantoms appeared in front of everyone’s eyes in unison. They were terrifying existences that could intimidate the myriad heavens. Their powerful strength was enough to shatter the world and defeat all enemies.
 What they saw were gods!
 The gods that had already disappeared in the long river of history were now resurrected in Lin Jiufeng’s God’s Domain. This terrifying power was accompanied by the music as it charged out.
 In God’s Domain, white flower petals danced in the air. They were crystal clear and floated around Lin Jiufeng. A refreshing fragrance filled the air with a trace of sorrow. It was as if they were paying their respects to the gods that had once been glorious but were now buried in the dust of history.
 The first music of the 12 Music of the Gods was the Overture of the Gods. It represented the glory of the gods. In this era, it was displayed with the help of Lin Jiufeng.
 “Kill!” Monster King Baiyu shouted angrily. He didn’t care about these. He held the spear in his hand and directly aimed for Lin Jiufeng’s head.
 The long spear in his hand was the peak of a quasi-immortal artifact. Although it wasn’t as terrifying as an immortal artifact, it was still an extremely powerful magic artifact. He was confident in killing Lin Jiufeng.
 He was a False Immortal who had crossed three lightning tribulations and had the Aspect Golden Body. His Aspect Golden Body was also roaring angrily. It also charged over.
 The commotion was huge!
 His aura was peerless!
 It was terrifying!
 But just as he arrived, the Overture of the Gods shook.
 Buzz!!!
 A calm ripple spread out, passing through the powerful quasi-immortal spear and landing on Monster King Baiyu’s body.
 Boom!
 Monster King Baiyu’s body suddenly exploded. Unexpectedly, amidst the white petals that filled the sky, he exploded just like that.
 Blood splashed, dying the white flower petals red. It added a sense of beauty to the scene. In God’s Domain, the scene was diverse and beautiful.
 These blood-red petals surrounded the white-robed Lin Jiufeng. At this moment, he was stunning to the world.
 “It’s also your blessing to be able to die under the 12 Music of the Gods,” Lin Jiufeng said calmly.
 This was the first time he used the 12 Music of the Gods, and it was also the first time he killed someone with it. Monster King Baiyu could feel the power of the gods that had disappeared in the long river of history.
 His death wasn’t unjustified!
 Everyone in the world watched as the petals danced in the air one after another. The crystal-like petals that filled the sky carried a faint bloody smell. All of them swallowed their saliva.
 They had personally witnessed the pure white petals being stained with blood, making Lin Jiufeng look like a holy lotus in the sea of blood.
 Monster King Baiyu was killed just like that?
 He was like a moth flying into the fire. With an extremely terrifying aura and powerful strength, he had charged over, but he exploded in the next instant. The beauty of that instant fulfilled Lin Jiufeng’s prestige.
 This scene looked extremely quiet and beautiful, but thinking about it carefully, everyone shivered.
 The pleasant music in their ears also became a lethal weapon that made everyone tremble.
 Wasn’t this Great Emperor Jiufeng of the Yuhua God Dynasty too powerful?
 Monster King Baiyu, who had transcended three lightning tribulations, was instantly killed in front of Lin Jiufeng.
 The False Immortals of the Myriad Races fell silent at this moment.
 No one dared to step forward.
 There were clear lakes in the convention of the Myriad Races. There were tall mountains that reached the clouds, magnificent waterfalls, and quiet bamboo forest trails. The scenery was diverse.
 But at this moment, everyone’s eyes were only filled with the blood-red petals that danced in the air. They heard the zither music ringing in their ears, resounding through the Hundred Thousand Mountains and the entire world. It carried with it a sense of sorrow as if the gods were weeping.
 But at this moment, all the cultivators of the Myriad Races were drenched in a cold sweat.
 The cold sweat had already drenched their clothes. Everyone felt cold from head to toe. They listened to the Overture of the Gods, but they didn’t feel sad. Instead, they felt that there was peerless killing intent contained in this song as if it could kill them in the very next moment.
 It was as if it would kill them too like how it killed Monster King Baiyu.
 In the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the Seven Great Sages were all extremely shocked when they saw this shocking scene.
 In the convention of the Myriad Races, the silent cultivators of the Myriad Races became Lin Jiufeng’s foil. This was a magnificent scene with a blood-stained bearing, vividly displaying Lin Jiufeng’s might, making everyone shocked and terrified.
 When this song appeared, the Myriad Races all fell silent. It would definitely make the people who saw it remember it for the rest of their lives.
 “It’s too terrifying.” Demon King Jiao’s body was trembling. His fear of Lin Jiufeng really increased exponentially every day and would never be able to recover.
 “This is my idol. He’s too powerful and too terrifying.” Demon King Gui sighed.
 “This time, the Hundred Thousand Mountains will be taken away by the Yuhua God Dynasty. We must go and join the Yuhua God Dynasty and discuss a method to coexist with them. We can’t go against the Yuhua God Dynasty,” Demon King Pingtian said.
 The other Great Sages nodded. Even the most arrogant of the Great Sages felt reverent and afraid in the face of the current Lin Jiufeng.
 In the Nest of 10,000 Dragons, the False Immortals were speechless.
 They were all shocked.
 Huang Xian’er swallowed and said with a trembling voice, “This… This is a true immortal, right?”
 Huang Xian’er’s words broke the silence. In an instant, the False Immortals in the Nest of 10,000 Dragons spoke one after another.
 “This is too terrifying.”
 “What kind of terrifying cultivation technique is this music?”
 “I feel that even if all of us from the Nest of 10,000 Dragons go together, we still won’t be a match for this person.”
 “That music just now seemed to be coming from the endless mountains and seas. I seemed to have seen a resplendent era with countless terrifying gods between heaven and earth. Each of them could make me kneel down and submit.”
 “I saw it too. This is too terrifying. I don’t even know if these people are real or just fabricated by the music.”
 “Why would such a terrifying person appear in the human race?”
 The people of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons were really shocked.
 They were quite knowledgeable. 15,000 years ago, they ruled a portion of the world and were the top faction among the Myriad Races.
 But facing Lin Jiufeng now, they couldn’t help but feel terrified.
 “Big Sister Divine Silkworm, how do you think we should interact with the human race next?” Huang Xian’er asked.
 Big Sister Divine Silkworm was as shocked as them. She said softly, “Next, we need to get along peacefully with them. The human race is no longer the human race from 15,000 years ago.”
 The False Immortals of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons felt uneasy all over. Hearing that they were going to live peacefully with the humans, they wanted to ask.
 What right did the human race have to coexist peacefully with them?
 But looking at Lin Jiufeng, they consciously shut up.
 “Can we wake up the other ancestors? They have been sealed from 15,000 years ago till now. If we wake them up, we should be able to resist this person,” Huang Xian’er suggested.
 “Why do you always want to be the first to stand out?” Big Sister Divine Silkworm frowned and looked at Huang Xian’er.
 Huang Xian’er was stunned.
 “The Primordial God Mountain was the first to stand out this time and suffered heavy losses. Dreamcloud Lake was also an accomplice and suffered a terrible blow, losing the Hundred Thousand Mountains. Aren’t you going to learn from their mistakes?” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said, exasperated at Huang Xian’er’s failure to live up to her expectations.
 Huang Xian’er apologized. “I was too impulsive. I wanted to destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty too much.”
 “Do you want to destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty, or do you want to suppress Princess Yulin of the Yuhua God Dynasty and take her in as a servant?” Big Sister Divine Silkworm asked.
 Huang Xian’er played dumb and smiled. “A little of both. I just want this Princess Yulin to become a maid. This way, I can ravage her.”
 Big Sister Divine Silkworm rolled her eyes at her and couldn’t be bothered with her. She warned, “Control some of your special hobbies. If you have the ability to, go capture Princess Yulin yourself. Don’t drag the Nest of 10,000 Dragons into this matter.”
 Huang Xian’er nodded and remembered it in her heart.
 …
 Yuhua God Dynasty, the imperial capital, Forbidden City!
 Waves of cheers sounded there. Everyone was excited. When they saw this shocking scene, all of them seemed to have been injected with chicken blood.
 “This is the Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty, the pillar of support for the Yuhua God Dynasty, the Great Emperor Jiufeng of the Yuhua God Dynasty!” Emperor De said loudly, his face full of excitement.
 Behind him, the Empress Dowager watched happily.
 “The trump card that your father left for me back then was Uncle. I didn’t expect that you guys had come into contact with him long ago.” The Empress Dowager sighed and said.
 Emperor De and Princess Yulin looked at each other and smiled. The pressure in their hearts was gone.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty would continue to suppress the world and manage the lives of the common people well. At the same time, it would nurture countless talented students.
 …
 The Hundred Thousand Mountains, the convention of the Myriad Races, the focus of everyone in the world.
 Lin Jiufeng stood there alone. He was dressed in white, but he looked like a magnificent army that blocked all the other races.
 Standing there alone, no one from the Myriad Races dared to challenge him.
 Even though there were dozens of False Immortals here, they didn’t dare to make a sound at this moment.
 Lin Jiufeng was dressed in snow-white clothes. His eyes were resplendent. He looked around. Under his gaze, all the False Immortals lowered their heads.
 Humiliation!
 The False Immortals of the Myriad Races all felt humiliated.
 They were actually forced into such a state by a weak human.
 This was simply unforgivable.
 The pride, arrogance, and aloofness that had always been carved in their bones made them feel terrible.
 But they didn’t dare to resist.
 Because the emergence of the Overture of the Gods wasn’t just a shock to the human race, it was a shock to all the Myriad Races too. Now, looking at Lin Jiufeng who was standing in the rain of flowers, they still feared in their hearts.
 If they had stood out like Black Crow and Monster King Baiyu just now, their bodies would have been shattered and they would have been consigned to eternal damnation.
 “The others from the Dreamcloud Lake must move out of the Hundred Thousand Mountains. What I said previously is still effective. The Myriad Races aren’t allowed to enter the Yuhua God Dynasty to fight. The Yuhua God Dynasty welcomes all friends to come and communicate and cooperate.”
 “To our friends, we have good wine. To our enemies, we have fists.”
 “This world is huge, and it’s still continuing to expand. All races have their own territory. All races shall coexist peacefully and mind their own business. The humans rule the land and don’t want to become enemies with the Myriad Races, but we aren’t afraid of becoming enemies with you!”
 “Is today’s battle convincing enough?”
 “If it’s not enough, I will personally go to your divine mountains and take a look at your territory. But I won’t be responsible for the consequences.”
 “This world is no longer the world from 15,000 years ago. The human race is no longer the human race from 15,000 years ago. I hope your thoughts can change.”
 Lin Jiufeng looked around and said calmly. With that said, he walked out of the convention of the Myriad Races, found the little white cat, and entered the carriage.
 Da da da!
 The white cat controlled the horse and they left.

                    



 Chapter 254: The Might of an Immortal Artifact!  
 The white cat controlled the carriage as they left.
 The Myriad Races were watching, but no one dared to stop them.
 ?
 How were they supposed to stop them?
 The terrifying scene from just now still couldn’t be forgotten. It was deeply imprinted in everyone’s minds.
 Even the False Immortals didn’t dare to say a word.
 Didn’t they see that the remaining False Immortals of Dreamcloud Lake didn’t even dare to fart now?
 The most powerful Monster King Baiyu of the current generation of the Dreamcloud Lake Race was killed. The others gnashed their teeth in hatred, but they still didn’t dare to make a sound.
 They were even hesitating if they should move away.
 After all, Lin Jiufeng was too powerful. He had given the order that the Yuhua God Dynasty would take back the Hundred Thousand Mountains. If they didn’t move away, wouldn’t they become subordinates of the Yuhua God Dynasty?
 Moreover, if they didn’t move away, they were also afraid that Lin Jiufeng would descend once again. The current False Immortals of Dreamcloud Lake wasn’t confident in dealing with Lin Jiufeng.
 Unless they brought out some old ancestors?
 But… this wasn’t the time yet.
 Dreamcloud Lake’s False Immortals looked at each other, feeling very conflicted.
 This convention of the Myriad Races really shocked many people.
 The Myriad Races were defeated. The Yuhua God Dynasty gained a complete victory. Without using an immortal artifact, the Yuhua God Dynasty suppressed the aggressive Myriad Races.
 The Patriarch of the Yuhua God Dynasty, who had always been mysterious, was now completely famous in the world. He was titled as the number one immortal in this world, Great Emperor Jiufeng!
 Great Emperor Jiufeng suppressed the Myriad Races and defeated the False Immortals of the Primordial God Mountain and the Dreamcloud Lake. He intimidated the Myriad Races and directly let the Yuhua God Dynasty continue to suppress the world.
 Before the convention of the Myriad Races, no one thought that this would happen. Countless people regarded Lin Jiufeng as seeking death this time.
 But now, everyone was stunned.
 Especially in the final battle, the Overture of the Gods appeared. The radiance of the gods scattered down, shocking the people of the world.
 Monster King Baiyu, who had undergone three lightning tribulations and condensed an Aspect Golden Body, was unable to resist the radiance of the gods at all. All the races were so scared that they didn’t dare to make a sound. One could imagine how terrifying this was.
 Hundred Thousand Mountains, the convention of the Myriad Races.
 Before Lin Jiufeng came, the event was bustling and lively. The Dreamcloud Lake Race had meticulously planned it because they wanted to open a glorious chapter in the history of their race.
 But after Lin Jiufeng came, the place was left in desolation.
 The people of the Myriad Races left. The various powerhouses also retreated one after another, not daring to stand out anymore.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty had this Great Emperor Jiufeng and an immortal artifact. Ordinary powerhouses couldn’t resist them.
 If they were to oppose the Yuhua God Dynasty now, the price would be too great unless the old ancestors from their respective races appeared.
 Only then could they resist the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Now, it was better to recuperate and get along peacefully with the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The convention of the Myriad Races started with a huge commotion and went through ups and downs. In the end, the Myriad Races suffered a crushing defeat and the Yuhua God Dynasty gained an even greater prestige.
 For example, the Nest of 10,000 Dragons, the Valley of Gods, and the Barbarians of the Northern Region all changed from their previous arrogance and became low-key, as if nothing had happened. They quietly recovered their strength, familiarized themselves with the new world, developed their races, and also understood the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 But the residents of the world immediately became excited. They laughed and sang loudly as if they were celebrating the new year. They were celebrating Great Emperor Jiufeng’s complete victory and protecting the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Lin Jiufeng saw all of this from the carriage.
 After leaving the convention of the Myriad Races, the little white cat controlled the carriage to move forward in the direction of the Yuhua God Dynasty’s imperial capital.
 She then jumped in and crawled into Lin Jiufeng’s arms. She asked curiously, “Where did you learn that Overture of the Gods that you executed?”
 Lin Jiufeng stroked her gently and said, “I got it by chance. What’s wrong?”
 “I just think it sounds nice,” the white cat said thoughtfully.
 “Sounds nice?” Black lines appeared on Lin Jiufeng’s forehead.
 Other people would explode under the power of the Overture of the Gods. Even if they weren’t in the attack range, listening to the Overture of the Gods still gave them a lot of pressure.
 How did it become nice sounding to the little white cat?
 “Why do you think it sounds nice? Didn’t you feel a strong pressure upon hearing it?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “I didn’t. Instead, I find it very pleasing to the ear.” The white cat shook her little head.
 “That shouldn’t be the case. The Overture of the Gods is the proclamation of the gods, representing the gods. Even if you think it’s nice sounding, you shouldn’t be unable to feel any pressure at all?” Lin Jiufeng ravaged the little white cat’s little head a few times, messing up her fur.
 The white cat broke free from Lin Jiufeng’s grip and said with a pair of moist eyes, “I did feel it. Of course, it’s different from what others feel. They are in awe of the might and majesty of the gods, but what I feel is the glory of the gods, the heroism of the gods, and the confidence of the gods.”
 Lin Jiufeng was dazed. Even he had never felt these feelings before from the Overture of the Gods.
 “You sensed these from the Overture of the Gods that I executed?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “Yes, the Overture of the Gods is the beginning of the gods. Of course it’s glorious. Can’t you hear this from the music?” The white cat asked in Lin Jiufeng’s arms.
 Lin Jiufeng shook his head and chuckled. “It seems that my understanding of the 12 Music of the Gods is inferior to yours.”
 “That shouldn’t be the case. How can you not understand something that can be heard so easily?” The white cat asked curiously.
 Lin Jiufeng shook his head. He really couldn’t tell.
 He was also puzzled.
 Logically speaking, Lin Jiufeng should know everything about the 12 Music of the Gods that he had received from signing in.
 But now, the white cat told him that there was something else in the Overture of the Gods.
 This puzzled Lin Jiufeng.
 Was it because he wasn’t careful when he was reading the information?
 But this shouldn’t be the case.
 Lin Jiufeng hugged the little white cat and looked outside through the window. He murmured, “There are too many secrets in this world. I have to understand them properly next. I still know too little now.”
 Although he had been in this world for about 100 years, he spent most of his time in the Cold Palace, signing in in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy, reading many books, and understanding quite a lot about this world.
 But once it involved the problems of the past, there was very little understanding of it.
 He didn’t even understand the era thousands of years ago, so how could he understand the Myriad Races from 15,000 years ago?
 Not to mention the Age of the Gods that was even older than the era of the Myriad Races.
 Lin Jiufeng needed to slowly understand these things. He looked at the green mountains and waters outside the window, lost in thought.
 After suppressing the Myriad Races, he had a lot of time. He should investigate these things properly next.
 “I shall return to the imperial capital and go to the Land of Extremely Negative Energy again to see if there are any unexpected gains. Then, I shall investigate the matter of the Myriad Races and the spiritual energy tide.” Lin Jiufeng set a goal for himself.
 …
 Primordial God Mountain!
 In the northern area far from the Yuhua God Dynasty, due to the recovery of spiritual energy, the sky rose and the ground expanded. A majestic divine mountain that pierced straight into the sky appeared.
 The Primordial God Mountain was entirely black, like an iron rod inserted into the ground.
 The divine mountain seemed to be alive. It was breathing in the essence of the mountains and rivers, emitting a terrifying aura. There was no one in a radius of thousands of miles, making the ancient divine mountain have an aura of looking down on the world.
 At the peak of the Primordial God Mountain, a black luster was reflected. It was suffused with a green light that flickered in the darkness. It made one’s hair turn cold and their souls couldn’t help but fall into depravity.
 It was as if just one more glance at it would suck away one’s divine soul and make one fall into depravity for all eternity.
 The Primordial God Mountain was a very domineering race among the Myriad Races.
 At this moment, the sound of iron chains crashing came from the Primordial God Mountain.
 “My son was killed!”
 A low and deep voice sounded, stirring the winds and clouds, surging with supreme divine laws. They quickly fluctuated and moved rhythmically, as if they were splitting the world apart, splitting the space, and making the primal chaos surge.
 In the Primordial God Mountain, everyone who had already recovered trembled. They quickly rushed into the distance to avoid these ripples. They didn’t dare to stop at all. This was almost like destroying the world.
 “Ancestor, King Invincible was killed by the Human Race. Please calm down.” A False Immortal hurriedly knelt down and shouted loudly.
 A False Immortal, who was extremely powerful in the eyes of the world and stood at the peak of cultivation, knelt down without hesitation at this moment. He didn’t have the dignity of a False Immortal.
 Or perhaps it’s because this terrifying person was too powerful.
 “Human Race!!!”
 A furious roar reverberated through the clouds and shattered the white clouds and birds.
 Clank…
 An even louder and ear-piercing sound of divine chains rang out. Chains of Order appeared in the world. They weren’t real but seemed to be chains cast down by the Heavenly Dao, trapping this person.
 Ka ka ka!
 The chains of the Heavenly Dao Order were very thick. Three layers inside and three layers outside locked this person up, but he still dragged the chains and let out an ear-piercing sound. It made every one of the Primordial God Mountain who had recovered feel their hair stand on end.
 Even though they were far away, they still heard it clearly. Sensing this terrifying aura, everyone only felt respect and fear in their hearts.
 It was as if a peerless Demon Emperor that had been sealed for thousands of years had come into being. The terrifying pressure made the Primordial Spirits of several False Immortals who were slightly closer to him tremble, about to be shattered. They could only retreat further and put a large distance between them before they could breathe slightly.
 Boom!
 A torrential black fog rushed up and drowned the entire ancient divine mountain. Even the sky was covered. A terrifying aura rushed out of the seal of the Heavenly Dao shackles and filled the surroundings!
 “Human Race!”
 “A race that can’t be any weaker can also kill my son?”
 “Are they worthy?”
 The terrifying demonic figure was bound by the Chains of Order, but he was still very powerful. The Chains of Order that bound him seemed to be trying their best to suppress him, but he still stood up.
 “King Heaven, please calm down. This world temporarily cannot accommodate you. No matter how angry you are, you cannot challenge the Chains of Order. I will tell you what happened.” The False Immortal kowtowed, turned pale with fright, and said in fear.
 “Hmph, this damn Heavenly Dao actually doesn’t allow us to come into being. Otherwise, how could these Chains of Order trap me?” The demonic figure snorted coldly and swept the Chains of Order angrily.
 Clank.
 The chains that were branded in the void sounded, bringing with them ripples of the Great Dao. It was extremely terrifying as if the gods of hell had unlocked their shackles, breaking free and killing their way into the mortal world.
 Together with the terrifying aura of the demonic shadow, if it weren’t for the people of the Primordial God Mountain being used to it, they would have probably been scared away long ago.
 But even so, the legs of the False Immortals were trembling. They felt terrified.
 Because once King Heaven and the Order of the Heavenly Dao fought, the aftershocks alone would be able to kill them.
 Hence, the False Immortal fearfully told him about the Yuhua God Dynasty, Lin Jiufeng, and the convention of the Myriad Races.
 “15,000 years!”
 “I didn’t expect that so much time would have passed. I’ve been in a deep sleep for so long that this world has forgotten how terrifying the Primordial God Mountain is. And that Human Race, that weak race that can only survive by relying on other stronger races. Now, they’re actually the ruler of the world, and that Great Emperor Jiufeng actually killed my son!”
 “How dare they!”
 “The Myriad Races are also useless. There are so many False Immortals, but none of them can take down a weak-bodied human. The convention of the Myriad Races has been tainted by you guys!”
 King Heaven’s demonic shadow cursed angrily. He was furious.
 The son that he had his eyes on was killed before he could even come into being. This was a huge blow to his plan.
 “King Heaven, please calm down. After you break free from your seal, you can go and kill that arrogant human. He actually dares to call himself Great Emperor. This title should only belong to you, King Heaven,” the False Immortal said respectfully.
 “No!”
 King Heaven flatly refused.
 “He killed my son. I can’t let him live a comfortable life anymore. Take my weapon and kill that arrogant human!” King Heaven’s voice rumbled as he said.
 Boom!
 As soon as his words landed, the world shook. A loud sound rang out, and then the powerful might of an immortal artifact erupted. Endless waves of light that were extremely powerful flickered as if they were illuminating the past and present.
 A long rod appeared in the air, emitting a torrential golden light. It instantly crushed the void. Light flickered for thousands of miles in the air, and the powerful aura suppressed the False Immortal to the ground.
 Immortal artifact!
 And in this golden light, one could see a terrifying huge figure with wings on its back and a long rod in hand, shattering terrifying enemies one after another.
 “Immortal artifact, God-Killing Rod!” The False Immortal said as he trembled under the might of the immortal artifact.
 He recognized what this rod was and how powerful it was. 15,000 years ago, countless people had died under this rod.
 “Take it. You are a False Immortal. With the God-Killing Rod in your hand, killing a weak human False Immortal shouldn’t be a problem. Go kill him now and bring back his head. Then, stir up a bloody massacre for me!” King Heaven’s huge body roared.
 “I want the Human Race to pay with their blood. The death of my son requires the entire Human Race to accompany him in death!” King Heaven said coldly.
 The False Immortal became excited. He received the God-Killing Rod and said, “King Heaven, don’t worry. I will go and kill him now!”
 “I’ll wait for your good news!” King Heaven looked coldly into the distance. He had nowhere to vent his anger and could only use such a method.
 …
 Lin Jiufeng sat on the carriage and slowly traveled back to the imperial capital. He wasn’t in a hurry to travel. After signing in for the Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens phenomenon at the convention of the Myriad Races, he used a day of practice and became completely skilled in controlling it.
 He wasn’t far from the imperial capital now.
 The carriage was unmanned, but the horse knew the path. The little white cat was controlling it inside.
 That night, Lin Jiufeng was resting with his eyes closed.
 But then, a wave of terrifying energy came, causing him to open his eyes. A cold light flashed inside.
 Boom!
 A huge metal rod instantly attacked. Terrifying energy ripples split the vast expanse of void. A chaotic aura lingered, and the ground began to crack. The surrounding mountains collapsed and the rivers were destroyed.
 This strike was shocking. Fortunately, Lin Jiufeng was in a forest with no one around. Under the cover of the night, the mountains and rivers should have been beautiful with greenery and water.
 But now, everything disappeared under this rod.
 Boom!
 Everything in the vicinity instantly collapsed. Countless mountains were reduced to dust, and Lin Jiufeng’s carriage couldn’t withstand the pressure and instantly collapsed.
 This scene was too terrifying. This iron rod stretched for hundreds of miles. It fell from the distant sky and shot out from the mountains, striking towards Lin Jiufeng’s head, its might peerless.
 “Human Race’s fake Emperor, die!” A loud roar descended from the sky.
 It was the False Immortal of the Primordial God Mountain. He brought along the God-Killing Rod and was full of confidence. He wanted to kill Lin Jiufeng so that he could go back and take credit for his achievements.
 Lin Jiufeng’s expression was cold. A cold light burst out from his eyes as he watched everything. The aura that descended from the God-Killing Rod caused the void to continuously shatter and chaos to entangle. It was very terrifying.
 But he wasn’t afraid. Instead, he sneered and said, “You don’t know the meaning of death. I released the Myriad Races because I don’t want to start a massacre, but you guys are seeking death yourselves. In that case, don’t blame me!”
 “You killed the young master of the Primordial God Mountain. Today, you will definitely die. This immortal artifact, the God-Killing Rod, is the supreme immortal artifact that will take your life!” The False Immortal of the Primordial God Mountain sneered.
 This strike of this rod seemed to have instantly severed the river of time and the shackles of space.
 The space and time around Lin Jiufeng’s body became incomparably chaotic. The Order and nomological powers of the Great Dao seemed to be instantly cut off. Only the God-Killing Rod in the void existed.
 “You have an immortal artifact, so what about it? I’ll come and kill you now!” The robe on Lin Jiufeng’s body flew up at this moment, transforming into an old turtle in the air. Its stiff turtle shell blocked the God-Killing Rod.
 Dang!!!
 A huge collision sound transformed into sound waves that split the night. The resplendent light transformed this moment of the night into day.
 Lin Jiufeng saw the False Immortal of the Primordial God Mountain at a glance.
 He took a step forward and pointed.
 “Die!” Lin Jiufeng said coldly.
 With this tap of his finger, the False Immortal of the Primordial God Mountain panicked. He wanted to resist, he wanted to use the God-Killing Rod to fight back.
 However, Lin Jiufeng’s speed was too fast. With a tap of his finger, the False Immortal of the Primordial God Mountain died on the spot.
 No one controlled the God-Killing Rod now, but it was still violent and wanted to kill Lin Jiufeng.
 But Lin Jiufeng had the Yuhua Immortal Robe. This was an immortal artifact that he signed in to. It wasn’t weaker than the God-Killing Rod, and what’s more, it was a defensive immortal artifact.
 The God-Killing Rod couldn’t gain any advantage against the Yuhua Immortal Robe.
 “You actually dare to bring this immortal artifact, the God-Killing Rod, to attack me? Then, don’t even think about bringing it back!” Lin Jiufeng snorted coldly. His God’s Domain expanded, and the powerful pressure combined with the Yuhua Immortal Robe suppressed the God-Killing Rod.

                    



 Chapter 255: Suppressing the Immortal Artifact  
 The Yuhua Immortal Robe was an immortal artifact with the divine soul of an ancient old turtle hidden inside. It was just that usually the ancient turtle seemed to be asleep, so Lin Jiufeng was unable to activate it.
 This time, its sudden appearance was because of the attack of the God-Killing Rod which carried with it the fury and divine soul of King Heaven. This caused the old turtle in the Yuhua Immortal Robe to be awakened and came out to resist the attack.
 ?
 Now, the False Immortal was easily killed by Lin Jiufeng. His God’s Domain spread and shrouded the surroundings. The old turtle in the Yuhua Immortal Robe raised its head and roared. Its four feet stepped down, causing the God-Killing Rod to tremble.
 Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
 The God-Killing Rod was resisting with all its might. Its entire body was black and had been personally crafted by King Heaven using a divine source stone. At this moment, the might that it was emitting was extremely terrifying.
 Now that the False Immortal wasn’t controlling it anymore, the God-Killing Rod became even stronger. Multicolored light shone resplendently, and auspicious energy surged. It was as if a terrifying invincible king had been resurrected and descended into the world.
 But the old turtle in the Yuhua Immortal Robe wasn’t someone to be trifled with either. It roared continuously and let out angry roars. The aura around its body surged, and a brilliant light shot in all directions. The old turtle’s huge body spat out endless colorful lights. There were even strands of chaos energy falling from the void, wrapping around the God-Killing Rod, and trapping its fighting will.
 “Suppress!” Lin Jiufeng shouted coldly.
 In the distant Primordial God Mountain, King Heaven, who was trapped by the Chains of Order, let out a furious roar. He sensed that Lin Jiufeng was suppressing his God-Killing Rod.
 “Lowly human, you dare to suppress my God-Killing Rod? You are courting death!” King Heaven roared. His voice was very loud, causing the people in the Primordial God Mountain to tremble in fear.
 And at this moment, the God-Killing Rod also trembled violently. It was resisting with all its might. Thick nomological powers of the Immortal Dao flowed out of the rod. This was King Heaven resisting Lin Jiufeng’s suppression from an endless distance away.
 Boom!
 Boundless black fog surged out from God-Killing Rod and shrouded the surroundings. In God’s Domain, it wasn’t inferior at all and its might didn’t decrease.
 In this black fog, a terrifying figure that was locked by the Chains of Order appeared. He stood tall with a cold expression. With wings on his back, his aura was violent and he rushed towards Lin Jiufeng.
 “Lowly human, kneel down before me!” King Heaven let out a loud voice that was deafening. It reverberated in the surroundings, bringing with it a huge pressure that covered the sky.
 Boundless killing intent erupted from the God-Killing Rod. It spread in all directions, seeming to turn into endless Dao power that wiped out all life.
 In the ancient era, King Heaven was also a terrifying enemy. At this moment, he was at an endless distance away with shackles on his back, but he still had such a terrifying might. Lin Jiufeng couldn’t help but frown.
 Was this the true terrifying existence of the Myriad Races?
 These were definitely False Immortals who had transcended five lightning tribulations or more. Their terrifying might resulted in the world sealing them, preventing them from descending yet.
 But King Heaven was still resisting heaven and earth. The reason he threw out his immortal artifact was to kill Lin Jiufeng.
 “You are a person rejected by the heavens and earth, yet you are still so arrogant. Today, I will let you know that the God-Killing Rod no longer belongs to you!” Lin Jiufeng shouted coldly. He decisively displayed the might of his God’s Domain.
 Rumble!
 In God’s Domain, a moon rose from the sea and the sea roared.
 The Great Dao constantly fell into the mortal world, bringing with it supreme might.
 Gods descended, bringing with them the music of the gods.
 An invincible immortal king walked over and attacked the sky.
 There was also an old turtle that ruthlessly pressed down.
 Boom!
 Boom!
 Boom!
 The world exploded. Light constantly burst forth, covering the sky and earth, making one frightened.
 The old turtle who was fighting against the God-Killing Rod was the main force, and Lin Jiufeng was the support. This was because the might of an immortal artifact wasn’t something that Lin Jiufeng could resist at this current stage.
 “A mere mortal dares to resist an immortal artifact?” King Heaven snorted coldly. He shook the Chains of Order, emitting a rumbling sound. The terrifying aura shook the ancient divine mountain, displaying his might and terror.
 As if it had eaten a great tonic, the God-Killing Rod actually pushed the old turtle up. Then, it struck down, causing the old turtle to stagger and let out an angry roar.
 “So what if you have an immortal artifact? You can’t even activate the might of your immortal artifact. You only relied on your immortal artifact’s instinct to suppress my immortal artifact. It’s simply a waste to place it in your hands!” King Heaven’s eyes burned as he stared at Lin Jiufeng, wishing he could burn him to ashes.
 A portion of the God-Killing Rod was activated, increasing his might greatly. King Heaven was confident in killing Lin Jiufeng.
 At this moment, the God-Killing Rod was enraged. It swayed and struck the old turtle, also disrupting God’s Domain.
 The world was resonating, the Great Dao was resonating, the True Dragon, Vermillion Bird, and various other immortal spirits all appeared. They danced around the God-Killing Rod, separating the two immortal artifacts. The result of the collision was complicated and terrifying. All sorts of strange scenes appeared and shrouded the sky.
 King Heaven looked at Lin Jiufeng, feeling that victory was in his hands. “You killed my son, so you shall die too. Not just you, but the entire Human Race will be buried with you. I will use the death of the Human Race as an offering to my dead son!”
 “You are dreaming. I will suppress this broken rod today. In your face, I will ask your God-Killing Rod to undergo a lightning tribulation!” Lin Jiufeng gritted his teeth. He decisively threw the little white cat out. Then, the aura around him rose uncontrollably like raging flames, extremely terrifying.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 The world was rumbling, and dark clouds were gathering. The Great Dao was entangled. Everything was developing in a bad direction.
 Tribulation Transcendence!
 At this critical moment, Lin Jiufeng decisively transcended the tribulation and activated his second lightning tribulation.
 The first time was the Opening of the Three Flowers, and this time was the Forming of the Five Energies.
 Lin Jiufeng could have transcended the tribulation long ago, but he had been enduring it. He originally wanted to return to the imperial capital and let nature take its course. He would wait until a rainy night and then begin to transcend the tribulation.
 But now, he couldn’t anymore. Lin Jiufeng had to activate the lightning tribulation right now.
 Boom!
 When the dark clouds were still condensing, a bolt of lightning struck from the clear sky. It descended from the sky, directly striking Lin Jiufeng’s location.
 The lightning tribulation arrived ferociously, bringing with it rain. It was extremely domineering, causing the ground and the mountains to tremble.
 The thick lightning tribulation struck Lin Jiufeng’s body, causing him to tremble.
 In the distance, the white cat watched worriedly. She paced around, feeling very regretful. She was too weak and couldn’t help Lin Jiufeng at all. She felt very guilty.
 The changes here also shocked the world.
 This lightning tribulation was completely different from the first time Lin Jiufeng had transcended the tribulation. The first time he had transcended the tribulation, he entered the void and his Primordial Spirit came out of his body. His Primordial Spirit experienced the baptism of the lightning tribulation and didn’t alert the world.
 Moreover, at that time, not many people knew that it was a tribulation transcendence. Under the spring thunder, Lin Jiufeng successfully transcended the tribulation.
 But it was different this time. Lin Jiufeng was the one who took the initiative to draw the lightning tribulation down. Moreover, the fluctuations of the battle between the two immortal artifacts couldn’t be concealed. Countless eyes instantly looked over, and they turned pale with fright.
 “Two immortal artifacts?”
 “This is the Great Emperor Jiufeng of the Yuhua God Dynasty. He’s controlling an immortal artifact to resist another immortal artifact?”
 “What immortal artifact is that rod that looks like a heavenly pillar?”
 “That old turtle should be an immortal artifact worn by Great Emperor Jiufeng. The Yuhua God Dynasty actually has two immortal artifacts?”
 “How is this possible? Other than that lamp, the Yuhua God Dynasty actually has another immortal artifact?”
 The entire world was in an uproar!
 The Valley of Gods, the Barbarians of the Northern Region, the Nest of 10,000 Dragons, the Dreamcloud Lake, the Yuhua God Dynasty, the various factions outside the borders, and the other overseas factions were all paying close attention.
 The convention of the Myriad Races in the Hundred Thousand Mountains had just ended for a day, but there was already a battle between immortal artifacts. The protagonist was still Great Emperor Jiufeng of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 If it weren’t for the fact that the might of the immortal artifact and the lightning tribulation couldn’t be concealed, they wouldn’t have discovered it.
 In the Ancient Kunlun Mountains, the people of the Nest of 10,000 Dragons were also paying close attention.
 “Big Sister Divine Silkworm, why does the Yuhua God Dynasty have two immortal artifacts?” Huang Xian’er was puzzled. Immortal artifacts were very difficult to obtain for False Immortals, especially when Lin Jiufeng was from this era. He wasn’t a cultivator from many years ago who could accumulate enough immortal artifacts.
 “I don’t know, but I know that iron rod!” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said solemnly.
 “What immortal artifact is that?” Huang Xian’er asked curiously.
 The other False Immortals listened attentively.
 “Among the few old ancestors on the Primordial God Mountain, there’s one called King Heaven. He was a top-grade king in the era of the Myriad Races. He has an immortal artifact called the God-Killing Rod!” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said solemnly.
 “King Heaven? This seems to be King Invincible’s father!” Huang Xian’er said in surprise.
 “That’s right. Great Emperor Jiufeng killed King Invincible and angered King Heaven. Therefore, he took out his immortal artifact.” Big Sister Divine Silkworm nodded.
 “That’s not right. King Heaven is very powerful. If he can come into being, then our ancestor can also come into being.” Huang Xian’er suddenly thought of this matter.
 “He didn’t come into being, he just forcefully woke up. Look carefully at that God-Killing Rod. There’s a portion of King Heaven’s divine soul in there, but it’s only a portion of it. Even so, this portion is also trapped by the Chains of Order of the Heavenly Dao. He’s going against the heavens and forcefully resisting the Chains of the Order, controlling the God-Killing Rod to kill Great Emperor Jiufeng.” Big Sister Divine Silkworm quickly discerned what was going on.
 “Resisting the Chains of Order and forcefully attacking in order to kill Great Emperor Jiufeng. Isn’t this too terrifying?” Huang Xian’er was speechless and shocked.
 The other False Immortals also watched in horror.
 “But even so, King Heaven didn’t manage to kill Great Emperor Jiufeng. Great Emperor Jiufeng even began to transcend the tribulation in such a crisis,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said faintly. She saw an even more terrifying side.
 This terrifying side made people feel terrified once they thought about it carefully.
 After being reminded by Big Sister Divine Silkworm, the others looked shocked.
 Was Great Emperor Jiufeng really a cultivator of this era?
 This was too terrifying.
 …
 At this moment, the attention of everything in the world gathered on Lin Jiufeng’s body.
 The sea of lightning was extremely ferocious, drowning this entire area. The sounds rang out endlessly, shocking the world.
 Heavy rain poured down. Dark clouds gathered and the lightning tribulation became increasingly vast.
 This lightning tribulation was very terrifying. It transformed the sky into a vast and boundless sea.
 The lightning clouds descended. It was truly like the end of the world. It made people tremble in fear.
 If it were them, they would definitely not make a sound after the first lightning struck.
 But Lin Jiufeng counterattacked. He opened his God’s Domain and flew into the air. Then, with his vast magic power, he swallowed this bolt of lightning in one gulp.
 This was a shocking scene!
 This scene made everyone’s eyes go straight. Their legs turned soft and they trembled.
 After devouring the lightning tribulation in one gulp, Lin Jiufeng’s entire body turned purple.
 Then, he directly refined it. With the help of the four phenomenons, he forcefully transformed the lightning tribulation into energy and injected it into the Yuhua Immortal Robe on his body.
 Rumble!
 During this process, Lin Jiufeng’s body was damaged by the lightning tribulation many times, but every time, he would repair it with Bai Tiandi’s [See Immortality in the Cycle of Reincarnation] technique.
 This was the most barbaric method of transcending the tribulation. If the energy exploded in his body, only death awaited him.
 But Lin Jiufeng withstood it.
 He injected all of this energy into the Yuhua Immortal Robe.
 The energy activated the soul of the immortal artifact.
 Just like the God-Killing Rod, only a portion of it was activated. But this portion was definitely enough for the old turtle.
 Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
 The old turtle raised its head. The phantom of the old turtle actually appeared somewhat real. Its body was suffused with purple light as it transformed into a lightning turtle.
 Roar!
 The old turtle that was withstanding the beating of the God-Killing Rod all this time suddenly erupted. With a swipe of its claws, it suppressed the God-Killing Rod beneath it. Then, it roared into the air. The subsequent wave of lightning tribulation wanted to continue producing, but it was all sucked over by the old turtle. With this, it spurted towards the God-Killing Rod.
 The lightning radiance was very dazzling. This piece of land became a sea of lightning. The old turtle was very terrifying. After a portion of it had been activated, it suppressed the God-Killing Rod. Then, it sucked over the surging lightning tribulations and used it to shatter the divine soul of King Heaven that was in the God-Killing Rod.
 “No…”
 In the Primordial God Mountain, King Heaven roared angrily and spat out a large mouthful of blood. He withstood the huge pressure of the Heavenly Dao to mobilize the God-Killing Rod. Now that the old turtle had destroyed that small portion of his divine soul, not only was he injured, but the Chains of Order also displayed their might and pressed down. They pressed down on King Heaven until his entire body was in pain. He couldn’t resist it, it was very unbearable.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, just you wait…” King Heaven roared angrily. His roar sounded through the dense black fog, looking extremely terrifying.
 Lin Jiufeng watched coldly. King Heaven who was trapped by the Chains of Order roared in incompetence, but it couldn’t change the truth.
 “The Yuhua God Dynasty shall take your God-Killing Rod. In the near future, I will personally make a trip to the Primordial God Mountain. At that time, I will personally kill you!” Lin Jiufeng said coldly.
 In front of the old turtle, the God-Killing Rod no longer had the strength to resist. It was completely suppressed by the old turtle.
 Lin Jiufeng casually picked it up and took a few looks. It was indeed a good immortal artifact, but that was all. He casually put it away. He had no use for this immortal artifact.
 “Good, very good! Human Race, you guys are really good. When I can descend into this world, I will definitely slaughter all the humans in the world!” King Heaven flew into a rage and made a bloody promise.
 Lin Jiufeng watched coldly and said, “You won’t be able to descend into this world anymore.”
 Boom!
 King Heaven wanted to say something, but the old turtle suddenly smashed the last wisp of black fog with its claws, shattering the last of his divine soul.
 Roar!!!
 The old turtle roared into the sky. Its voice shook the sky, letting the world hear its voice. It was extremely terrifying.
 A defensive immortal artifact didn’t mean that it didn’t have much offensive power. As long as the immortal artifact’s soul was activated, it would definitely be able to defend against attacks and also attack others.
 In the end, the old turtle still disappeared. The world gradually recovered its calm. The area of hundreds of miles was completely destroyed. The battle between the two immortal artifacts let the people of the world see the terrifying might of the immortal artifacts and also the unfathomable depths of Great Emperor Jiufeng.
 At this moment, Lin Jiufeng stood on the destroyed land. His expression was calm, his white clothes fluttered, and he looked like an exiled immortal.
 He didn’t feel sad or happy. Even though he gained the God-Killing Rod, he just gained another immortal artifact, that was all.
 The true threat was the Myriad Races.
 “The truly powerful people of the Myriad Races are like King Heaven, shackled by the Chains of Order. I have to continue becoming stronger in order to withstand the impact of their subsequent emergence.” Lin Jiufeng murmured in his heart.
 He originally thought that he was powerful enough, but from the looks of it, he was still not powerful enough.
 The waters of this world were too deep.
 It was unfathomable. Lin Jiufeng was only standing on the first level, but there were many levels in this world.
 “I need to become stronger and continue to improve myself and reveal the true colors of this world.” Lin Jiufeng’s eyes were firm.
 He had already transcended the second lightning tribulation and completely entered the Forming of the Five Energies stage. The five energies in his chest had already been formed. Next was to cultivate the Aspect Golden Body and enter the third stage of the False Immortal Realm.
 [Suppressed the immortal artifact, God-Killing Rod. Do you want to Sign in?]
 A line of words suddenly appeared before his eyes.
 Lin Jiufeng watched calmly and nodded. “Sign in!”
 He wasn’t very surprised that he could sign in after suppressing an immortal artifact.
 [Sign-In successful. Received Seven Sage Enlightenment Pill!]
 A pure white pill the size of a longan appeared in Lin Jiufeng’s hand. It was as white as jade and emitted a refreshing fragrance. Hearing it carefully, it was like there was someone preaching in the air around him. The Great Dao was obscure, but by listening carefully to this preaching, the Great Dao seemed to become as simple as drinking water or eating food.
 Lin Jiufeng carefully read through the information regarding the Seven Sage Enlightenment Pill.
 “In the past ages, there have been seven terrifying powerhouses who have transcended the mortal realm and entered the sage realm. They will teach the Dao and discuss the Dao with you for seven days. How much you comprehend will depend on your own fortune!”
 This was the information about the Seven Sage Enlightenment Pill. Lin Jiufeng was overjoyed. This could be considered a pleasant surprise for the current him.
 With the Seven Sage Enlightenment Pill, it was only a matter of time before he broke through to the third stage of the False Immortal Realm.
 Meow!
 The white cat ran over from afar and looked at Lin Jiufeng with concern.
 “Are you hurt?” The white cat asked.
 Lin Jiufeng put away the Seven Sage Enlightenment Pill and opened his hand, letting the little white cat jump up. He asked, “What injury can a broken rod cause me?”
 “Then, should we go to the Primordial God Mountain to take revenge, or should we return to the imperial capital?” The white cat asked.
 Lin Jiufeng thought for a while and said, “Let’s return to the imperial capital now. There’s no hurry to take revenge. Let’s take our time.”
 Now, he had to go back and consume the Seven Sage Enlightenment Pill to improve himself. Only by becoming stronger could he deal with all the demons and monsters.
 On the plains, under the gaze of countless powerhouses, Lin Jiufeng brought the little white cat with him as he walked back to the imperial capital under the setting sun.
 The powerhouses of the world all sighed. Wasn’t this too powerful? Even when an immortal artifact appeared, it didn’t manage to kill Great Emperor Jiufeng. Who could defeat him now?
 The status of the Yuhua God Dynasty was unbreachable and immovable.
 …
 In the imperial capital, Lin Jiufeng returned once again.
 He directly returned to the Cold Palace. Looking at the dilapidated place, he felt a trace of intimacy.
 Dong!
 Lin Jiufeng casually inserted the God-Killing Rod into one side of the Cold Palace and ignored it. Instead, he returned to his courtyard and said to the little white cat, “I’m going into seclusion for a period of time.”
 “Alright.” The white cat nodded. She also had to cultivate and breakthrough as soon as possible. Otherwise, the gap between her and Lin Jiufeng would only continue to widen.
 “Probably nothing will happen in the world during my seclusion this time. Go and tell Emperor De to execute his ideas freely. Use the influence of my appearance this time to continue the reform of the Yuhua God Dynasty for the country and the people!” Lin Jiufeng instructed.
 “Alright, I’ll go tell Emperor De now!” The white cat agreed.
 “Okay, go.” Lin Jiufeng closed the door and took out the Seven Sage Enlightenment Pill. He swallowed it and laid on the bed, his mind entering a magical place.
 This place was chaotic and void.
 Around Lin Jiufeng, seven terrifying phantoms appeared. They then taught and discussed the Dao with him.
 Lin Jiufeng silently absorbed their knowledge.

                    



 Chapter 256: The Former Supreme Powerhouses (Part 1)  In the mysterious space flowed a Great Dao that could be seen with the naked eye.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the seven mysterious people around him.
 Each of them exuded a terrifying aura and carried extremely terrifying energy fluctuations. These weren’t their true bodies, but just a wisp of consciousness.
 The Seven Sage Enlightenment Pill wasn’t something that humans could produce in the first place.
 From the long river of history, a wisp of the consciousness of the seven powerhouses was collected and integrated into a pill to help the user comprehend the Dao. No one would believe this even if news of this got out.
 But now, crossing over millions of years, they were discussing the Dao face-to-face with Lin Jiufeng.
 The seven days weren’t for them to discuss the Dao together, but a day for each person.
 On the first day, Lin Jiufeng saw an old man. He had a head of gray hair and a serious expression on his face. He came in front of Lin Jiufeng and said face-to-face, “The land is filled with sorrow and blood, all because of a thought to save the people!”
 As soon as these words came out, a surging Great Dao spread out, covering Lin Jiufeng’s body in a majestic manner.
 This person’s Dao was filled with reforms, struggles, and unyielding.
 With a thought, the sun, moon, mountains, rivers, and the world were overturned. The old era was reformed and a new era was ushered in.
 Lin Jiufeng watched silently. He comprehended the Dao in the surroundings and was filled with passion. There was no magnificent performance like the blooming of golden lotus flowers on the ground and flowers raining from the sky like in the legends.
 This person’s Dao was in the facts, in results, in the common people!
 On this day, Lin Jiufeng was like a sponge, frantically absorbing nutrients and filling himself up. His cultivation realm rose frantically.
 From beginning to end, it was this person who spoke and expounded on his own Dao. With a flip of his palm, the world would change, an old era would disappear and a new era would descend.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t overestimate his capabilities and discussed the Dao with him.
 The Seven Sage Enlightenment Pill said that he could discuss the Dao with the sages, but Lin Jiufeng knew that he had yet to reach the Immortal Realm and that his Dao was still very scattered. It would be a joke for him to discuss the Dao with others.
 He didn’t say anything, he just watched and listened.
 He watched as this old man thoroughly dissected his Dao and broadened his horizons.
 At the last moment, this old man disintegrated himself and transformed into a crystal clear Great Dao that entangled around Lin Jiufeng. He left behind a sentence.
 [Because of the sacrifices of the many brave souls, even the world can be changed!]
 It had the same meaning as the previous sentence [The land is filled with sorrow and blood, all because of a thought to save the people].
 Lin Jiufeng watched and listened silently. He had a deep understanding of this person’s Dao and learned this supreme powerhouse’s name.
 The Lord of Mortal Life!
 From the long river of history, a wisp of consciousness of this supreme powerhouse came here and formed a fate with Lin Jiufeng.
 After this day, Lin Jiufeng rested for a short two hours. He sorted out the Dao of the Lord of Mortal Life and completely integrated it into his body and his God’s Domain.
 “In the long river of history, there’s actually such a talented powerhouse.” Lin Jiufeng said to himself. He had read many books, including all the secret manuals of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but he had never seen any records of this Lord of Mortal Life.
 If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, Lin Jiufeng wouldn’t have known that such a person had been born in the past.
 The Lord of Mortal Life disappeared, and the comprehension of the Dao on the second day continued.
 This time, it was a middle-aged man who looked very young. His body was powerful-looking, a head of black hair was draped behind him, and his eyes were like lightning. With a single step, he directly stepped through the sealed era.
 “I came from the sealed era. I shattered the sun, moon, mountains, rivers, overturned the Immortal Court, and rebuilt the mountains and rivers!” This person said in a loud and clear voice. He directly threw out a supreme brilliance with his random punches. It was very bright, resplendent, and incomparably dazzling.
 This was the vigor that belonged to the young. His Dao was domineering and full of life energy. It carried with it supreme glory, blazing like a raging fire, burning Lin Jiufeng until he felt a little hot.
 Lin Jiufeng liked this person’s Dao very much. He also knew that this person wasn’t from a very distant era, because he said that he came from the sealed era.
 Lin Jiufeng, who had read countless books, knew that the era he was in now was the sealed era.
 The spiritual energy in the world would form a tide that would cycle once every few thousand years. Moreover, many powerful races and powerful people were sealed up.
 Even though the Myriad Races had descended, some old ancestors were still shackled by the Chains of Order. They couldn’t break free and couldn’t truly descend yet.
 This era now was the sealed era.
 And 15,000 years ago, it was the era of the Myriad Races.
 Hence, this middle-aged man should be the powerhouse closest to Lin Jiufeng in times of history.
 “It’s not easy. After the era of Myriad Races, the spiritual energy tides have been repeated over and over. To think that a supreme powerhouse could actually appear. Amazing.” Lin Jiufeng was sincerely impressed.
 This person’s Dao was just right for Lin Jiufeng. It was blazing like the sun, giving Lin Jiufeng a lot of inspiration.
 Finally, before he disappeared, he looked at Lin Jiufeng. His eyes were like lightning as he said, “I saw you 14,000 years ago, Great Emperor Jiufeng!”
 Lin Jiufeng asked curiously, “You saw me through the future?”
 “This era will experience a change in history that has never happened before in history. Great Emperor Jiufeng, thank you for your hard work,” the middle-aged man said.
 “Who are you?” Lin Jiufeng asked in a low voice.
 “King of Recovery!” The middle-aged man replied.
 “Other than seeing me, what else did you see?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “The future is ever-changing. There are countless possibilities in the long river of time. With a thought from you, countless tributaries will be created. What I saw isn’t important. It’s the blessing of this world to have you in this era. Continue to become stronger,” the King of Recovery said with a smile. He wasn’t stingy. Before he dissipated with the wind, he displayed all of his Great Dao for Lin Jiufeng to see.
 Lin Jiufeng stood calmly in the same spot. The Great Dao in his body surged, constantly strengthening his body and increasing his realm. All obstacles became fragile under the impact of the Great Dao of the two supreme powerhouses.
 “The King of Recovery from 14,000 years ago?” Lin Jiufeng murmured. This was another unknown powerhouse. There were no records of him in the books.
 In the books that Lin Jiufeng had read, there was no information about the Lord of Mortal Life and the King of Recovery. If he hadn’t seen and experienced the Great Dao of these two people with his own eyes at this moment, he wouldn’t have known about these two people.
 “I really need to look up a lot of information. I know too little about this world,” Lin Jiufeng said to himself. He had always been hiding in the Cold Palace and signing in. Perhaps he could do this in the past because the world was safe and sound.
 But as his strength increased, he couldn’t carry on living like this.
 This world was completely different from the world 100 years ago. It was no longer possible to cultivate behind closed doors.
 Lin Jiufeng needed to walk out and take a look at this world. At the same time, he also needed to investigate the secrets of this world that were hidden beneath the coat of light.
 “Who will be the third?” Lin Jiufeng had come into contact with two powerhouses in a row, but he didn’t know either of them. He wanted to see if he would recognize who the third powerhouse was.
 The third person walked out and brought along a piece of music. Lin Jiufeng watched in surprise.
 “Overture of the Gods?”

                    



 Chapter 257: The Former Supreme Powerhouses (Part 2)  The music sounded, bringing with it a clear radiance that scattered the radiance belonging to the gods. What greeted Lin Jiufeng’s eyes was a woman sitting on a throne.
 This woman was indescribably noble. Beneath her cold face, there was a powerful divine radiance. She was an absolutely beautiful woman.
 She was from the God Race!
 She descended in front of Lin Jiufeng with the 12 Music of the Gods.
 “I shall continue the glory of the gods!”
 The woman didn’t speak. She looked at Lin Jiufeng coldly, but a voice sounded in the air.
 The throne she was sitting upon was originally the most powerful magic treasure in the world, but at this moment, it was covered in scars. All sorts of weapons had left scars on its surface.
 But this still couldn’t hide the power and terrifying might of this throne, as well as the divine pressure radiating from it.
 “You are a God?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “There’s actually someone who still remembers the Gods in this era?” The voice sounded again from the void. The woman on the throne continued to look at Lin Jiufeng coldly, only blinking her eyes.
 “Of course, I remember!” Lin Jiufeng said. Behind him, an overture also appeared. It was the Overture of the Gods. It descended here, causing the woman on the throne to be stunned as she watched in a daze.
 “The first of the 12 Music of the Gods, the Overture of the Gods!” The voice in the air was ethereal, carrying a trace of emotion, a trace of nostalgia, and a trace of shock.
 “You actually comprehended the 12 Music of the Gods in this era…”
 “No wonder I came here. It turns out that it’s because you remembered the God Race!”
 The woman on the throne looked at Lin Jiufeng. Her expression became gentler. Her voice came from the air. It was a woman’s voice, full of magnetism and with a trace of gentleness. Hearing it, it seeped into one’s heart, as if it could soothe all the impetuousness.
 “Why did the Gods disappear?”
 “What exactly happened in the past?”
 “Who are you?”
 Lin Jiufeng continuously asked his own queries.
 He was really puzzled.
 In this era, Lin Jiufeng was very powerful and invincible. He was confident that he could continue to be invincible. In this current era, no one was his match.
 Not even if all the Myriad Races were to recover.
 But compared to the previous eras, where many people and the past were sealed in history, Lin Jiufeng was as weak as a moth, feeling lost in the mortal world.
 “The gods disappeared because of humans, but maybe the gods never disappeared!”
 “What happened in the past was also something that the gods have always been searching for. But we didn’t find a specific answer.”
 “I am the King of Gods!”
 The woman’s expression became proud as a domineering voice sounded in the air.
 “The King of Gods…” Lin Jiufeng looked at her. The woman sitting on the throne crossed her legs. Her aura was peerless. She looked ahead as if she was looking at the endless years ago when she looked down on all her enemies.
 “Can you tell me what exactly happened in the Age of the Gods?” Lin Jiufeng asked solemnly.
 “The Age of the Gods was a tragedy. I don’t remember what happened either. You can explore it yourself. I’m just a wisp of memory, here to spread the Great Dao of the gods. Since you have the 12 Music of the Gods, it shouldn’t be difficult for you to comprehend it.” The King of Gods looked at Lin Jiufeng. A voice sounded from the void. Then, with a bang, the radiance of the gods directly exploded. Endless light shrouded Lin Jiufeng.
 In these lights, Lin Jiufeng saw how terrifying the gods were. He saw the power of the gods that could create worlds, and he also saw the Great Dao of the gods.
 She didn’t hide it at all.
 The gods and the Great Dao were there. He could reach out and comprehend it at any time.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t waste time asking questions. He seized the opportunity to comprehend it. He had very little time. He only had one day, there wasn’t much to waste.
 The Dao of the gods was that of supreme glory. In the kingdom of the gods, everyone was very talented, always advancing towards a higher level. The gods brought hope to the world. This radiance of the gods was so dazzling and the Great Dao of the gods was so powerful.
 Lin Jiufeng absorbed it frantically. Just as the King of Gods had said, he had the 12 Music of the Gods. It wasn’t difficult for him to comprehend it at all.
 The Dao of the gods was a huge one, and it was also a great one. The glory of the gods disappearing in the long river of history was a type of loss to the world.
 The King of Gods didn’t hide anything and displayed everything to Lin Jiufeng. Even if Lin Jiufeng couldn’t comprehend it now, it didn’t matter.
 It was good enough as long as he could memorize it.
 The King of Gods looked at Lin Jiufeng. Her eyes were gentle, carrying a trace of brightness and also a kind of hope.
 After showing Lin Jiufeng the Great Dao of the gods, the King of Gods slowly dissipated. In this chaotic space, she completely disappeared.
 One day passed.
 Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes and looked around. It was empty. There was no trace of the King of Gods anymore. He felt slightly regretful.
 “I still have many questions to ask,” Lin Jiufeng said to himself. But thinking about it carefully, the King of Gods that had appeared in front of him was just a wisp of consciousness. She didn’t know much. Even if he asked the questions, she probably couldn’t answer them.
 After absorbing the Dao of the gods, Lin Jiufeng’s realm advanced by leaps and bounds. He felt that he had improved a lot, but he didn’t know exactly what realm he had reached.
 Because his current realm on the surface was only the second stage of the False Immortal Realm, the Forming of the Five Energies.
 But his realm in the dark had already soared to an unknown extent.
 When he went out this time, as long as he started transcending the tribulation, he would climb to a very high realm in a single step.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t care about these now. What he cared more about was who would appear next.
 Boom!
 On the fourth day, the chaotic space began to tremble, emitting endless light. It transformed into a sharp blade that swept through the nine heavens, cutting through the vast expanse in front of it.
 A poem sounded.
 “I have an immortal heart that has been locked up by the dust for a long time. When the dust is gone, this heart will appear again and shine through the myriad mountains and rivers!”
 Lin Jiufeng’s heart trembled when he heard this poem. He hurriedly opened his eyes to take a look.
 A figure standing at the end of the world appeared in Lin Jiufeng’s eyes. This figure possessed a mighty power, but it was fighting against the heavens.
 “Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens!” Lin Jiufeng called out involuntarily.
 He was familiar with this figure. This was the phenomenon that he had signed in not long ago.
 Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens!
 From the past, a terrifying Immortal King appeared out of nowhere and went against the heavens. He created a peerless scene that was recorded by many people.
 After Lin Jiufeng had signed in successfully, he had always been learning about the might of the Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens phenomenon. It was really terrifying. And now, he saw the main character of this phenomenon with his own eyes.
 “Immortal King…” Lin Jiufeng shouted.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng!” The Immortal King nodded at Lin Jiufeng.
 This was an ordinary middle-aged man. His figure was slightly thin, and he was dressed in linen clothes. He looked like an ordinary mortal merchant.
 But wherever he stood, he would become the center of the world.
 A mysterious Immortal King in the long river of history!
 “Immortal King, you know me?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “I sensed that someone was gathering the Great Dao of the supreme powerhouses, so I peeked into a sliver of the future. I saw a corner of the future, so I sent this wisp of consciousness here. I hope it can help you out, Great Emperor Jiufeng!” The Immortal King said calmly.
 There was no aura around him. He was like an ordinary person, and his words were also very gentle.
 He didn’t look like an invincible Immortal King, but more like a neighbor’s uncle.

                    



 Chapter 258: The Problem of Time  Lin Jiufeng looked at the Immortal King in front of him and asked, “Immortal King, why did you go attack the Nine Heavens?”
 “To pry into the secrets of the immortals,” replied the Immortal King.
 “The secret of the immortals?” Lin Jiufeng looked at the Immortal King, puzzled.
 “Where did immortals come from? I wanted to understand this secret,” the Immortal King said.
 “Have you figured it out?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “I don’t know!” The Immortal King shook his head.
 “You don’t know?” Lin Jiufeng looked at the Immortal King in surprise.
 “When I was sent here, I hadn’t started my attack on the Nine Heavens yet,” the Immortal King said softly.
 “Before I attacked the nine heavens, I peeked into the future to see if there was a new answer in the river of time. That’s when I met you in the river of time. Then, this wisp of my consciousness carried the Dao of the Immortal King and was sent here. I don’t know what happened after that,” the Immortal King said.
 “I see!” Lin Jiu was suddenly enlightened. He smiled bitterly. It seemed that this Immortal King wouldn’t be able to solve his doubts either.
 The reason why the Immortal King attacked the Nine Heavens was to figure out where the immortals came from.
 Lin Jiufeng had heard this problem from Elder Universe in the Undying Mountain of the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 The senior of the Heavenly Dao Sect, Elder Universe, had mentioned this problem before.
 He had said that there was a problem with the Dao of the Immortals.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t understand at that time. But from the looks of it now, he had to pay more attention in the future and find more information in this area.
 “I’m only in charge of passing down the Dao. I don’t know anything else. I’ll give you my Great Dao now.” The Immortal King seemed to have guessed Lin Jiufeng’s thoughts. He said directly and punched out.
 Boom!
 This punch shattered Lin Jiufeng. Endless Great Dao surged into Lin Jiufeng’s flesh, blood, and bones, rebuilding him at this moment.
 Destroy the enemy with a punch to prevent receiving 100 punches from the enemy!
 This was the character of the Immortal King. If he encountered a problem, he would solve it. Then, he would follow the clues and find the person behind the scenes, then directly kill that person.
 Lin Jiufeng deeply felt it at this moment.
 His body exploded, but his consciousness was extremely clear. He sensed the Immortal King’s Dao and sank into it.
 In this place of chaos, Lin Jiufeng’s body slowly recovered. He comprehended an extremely powerful Dao in the Immortal King’s Great Dao.
 Reverse time and space, control of the chaos energy, Yin energy, and Yang energy.
 When Lin Jiufeng was comprehending the Dao, he even saw a shocking scene.
 The Immortal King came to the sea and discussed the Dao with someone.
 That person said, “My Dao is that of controlling the world with a flip of my palm!”
 The Immortal King was expressionless. He directly punched out and exploded the other party with his fist.
 “This is my Dao!” The Immortal King said directly.
 The Immortal King was famous for killing.
 Killing had always been his forte. His Dao was that of killing, which could destroy everything.
 Lin Jiufeng was studying it carefully.
 He sank into it and swam freely in the vast Great Dao, feeling the terrifying Great Dao of the Immortal King.
 Fortunately, Lin Jiufeng had the Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens phenomenon. It wasn’t difficult for him to comprehend it at all. It was just that this Great Dao was too vast, too dense, and too mellow. He needed to comprehend and absorb it very thoroughly.
 The Immortal King looked at the Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens phenomenon appearing on Lin Jiufeng’s body and murmured, “It seems that I succeeded. I wonder if I found the answer I wanted?”
 No one answered his question. Lin Jiufeng had sunk into the Great Dao. The surroundings were empty. Right then, the Immortal King sighed and his figure disappeared.
 Only Lin Jiufeng was left, wandering alone with the Great Dao.
 A day later, Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes. He looked around, but there was no sign of the Immortal King.
 Lin Jiufeng knew that the Immortal King had disappeared.
 He put away the disappointment and the many doubts in his heart as he waited for the fifth powerhouse to appear.
 The first four were all very powerful existences.
 The Lord of Mortal Life, the King of Recovery, the King of Gods, the Invincible Immortal King!
 Lin Jiufeng looked forward to the next three people.
 They should also be powerful existences that have been forgotten by history.
 But the truth was unexpected.
 The fifth supreme powerhouse didn’t appear. Only a phantom appeared, then raised his hand and struck, causing this space of chaos to tremble. A Great Dao appeared and it was very unfamiliar. Lin Jiufeng couldn’t figure out who it was.
 The fifth supreme powerhouse didn’t appear and just directly imparted the Great Dao to Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng couldn’t force it. He could only silently comprehend this Great Dao.
 On this day, he didn’t dare to stop for even a moment. The fifth Great Dao was slightly obscure and difficult to understand. Unlike the previous few, Lin Jiufeng had to focus fully in order to memorize all of it in one day.
 It didn’t matter if he couldn’t comprehend it now, he just had to memorize it.
 Then, when he was free next time, he could silently comprehend it.
 Lin Jiufeng thought that the fifth powerhouse was a special existence. He used a day to record the Great Dao of this supreme powerhouse in his memory.
 On the sixth day, he looked forward to the sixth supreme powerhouse.
 Boom!
 But Lin Jiufeng only received a ball of Great Dao that entered his body like raging flames.
 The sixth supreme powerhouse didn’t appear either.
 Similar to the fifth, he also imparted the Great Dao to Lin Jiufeng and then disappeared without revealing his appearance.
 Lin Jiufeng couldn’t care about anything else. He made the best use of his time to comprehend it. Even if he couldn’t comprehend it in a day, memorizing it was still good.
 In any case, after he went out, he could slowly comprehend it.
 The seventh day!
 Lin Jiufeng was still waiting for the last supreme powerhouse.
 But the situation was exactly the same as before. This powerhouse didn’t show his face either. He only pointed out and a ball of light which contained the Great Dao seeped into Lin Jiufeng’s body.
 Lin Jiufeng’s body was trembling. His spiritual consciousness was changing and transforming into millions of illusions. The Great Dao of Illusion trapped Lin Jiufeng inside, making him unable to extricate himself.
 The seventh supreme powerhouse’s Great Dao was carefully memorized by Lin Jiufeng. He was unable to comprehend such a huge Great Dao in one day.
 In fact, Lin Jiufeng had comprehended a lot of the Great Dao of the seven peerless powerhouses, but there were even more of these Great Dao that he hadn’t comprehended.
 When seven days had passed, Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes. The world appeared before his eyes.
 The real world!
 He was still lying on the bed, quiet and peaceful. His hands were on his lower abdomen, and his expression was calm.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t get up. He just laid on the bed and pondered.
 “Seven supreme powerhouses. The first four appeared in front of me and told me their names and identities. They chatted with me.”
 “But the last three were so mysterious that they didn’t even show their faces. But why?”
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t understand.
 “Perhaps, it’s because of time.” After thinking about it, this was the only possibility.
 They were all supreme powerhouses, it was definitely not because the cultivation bases of the last three were poor and they couldn’t come out.
 The answer must be time.
 Be it the Lord of Mortal Life, the King of Recovery, the King of Gods, or the Invincible Immortal King, these four were all from eras that were close to Lin Jiufeng’s era.
 Even if the gap was 20,000 years, it was still closer than the last three.
 “Time is passing, the banana leaves turned red, and the grapes turned black.”
 “The last three supreme powerhouses imparted the Dao to me from a time that was very, very far away. That’s why they came and went in a hurry. They didn’t show their faces and only delivered the Great Dao to me.”
 Lin Jiufeng muttered to himself. He felt that his guess was correct.

                    



 Chapter 259: Time Flies  Although he didn’t see the figures of the last three supreme powerhouses, Lin Jiufeng remembered their Great Dao.
 He got up from the bed and walked out of the room. He saw the Cold Palace, the imperial capital, the Forbidden City, Emperor De, Princess Yulin, the world of the humans, and this entire world.
 At this moment, the world became so clear that Lin Jiufeng could clearly see the Great Dao flowing in the sky.
 The realm of his soul far exceeded his current cultivation base and had reached a terrifying level.
 This terrifying degree made Lin Jiufeng raise his head. He could see that there was a lightning tribulation stirring in the depths of the sky.
 If he wanted to transcend the tribulation, he could directly do so now.
 It wasn’t just one lightning tribulation, but many lightning tribulations stacked together. That would be an extremely terrifying scene.
 But Lin Jiufeng wasn’t in a hurry to transcend the tribulation. He retracted his gaze and rubbed his glabella.
 “To me, I have only comprehended a small portion of the Great Dao of the seven peerless powerhouses. There’s still a large portion that I haven’t comprehended. I need to properly comprehend their Dao before I can absorb them fully. There’s no hurry to transcend the tribulation, I can do that anytime,” Lin Jiufeng said to himself.
 To the current him, transcending the lightning tribulation was just a formality.
 Meow!
 The white cat sensed Lin Jiufeng’s aura and rushed over.
 “Why is your aura so chaotic after your seclusion?” The white cat asked worriedly.
 Lin Jiufeng thought to himself, ‘The Dao of seven supreme powerhouses are gathered on me alone, how could it not be chaotic?’
 “I am going to enter deep seclusion for a few years to properly sort out my Dao. Help me keep guard,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “Go into seclusion for several years?” The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng in surprise.
 “At this current period?” The white cat asked curiously.
 At this time, the Myriad Races had just recovered, bringing with them a huge shock to the world. Although they were suppressed by Lin Jiufeng once, the foundation of the Myriad Races still existed and couldn’t be underestimated. If Lin Jiufeng entered seclusion, the little white cat was worried that the Myriad Races would cause trouble at this time.
 “It’s fine. I will leave behind some backup plans to ensure that the Yuhua God Dynasty can operate steadily,” Lin Jiufeng said seriously.
 He also knew that it wasn’t good to enter seclusion at this critical moment, but he had to improve himself. In order to face the subsequent series of storms, the Great Dao of the seven supreme powerhouses was something that Lin Jiufeng had to fully comprehend.
 Seeing that the night had darkened, Lin Jiufeng thought for a while and summoned Princess Yulin and Bai Tiandi.
 “Come to the Cold Palace. I have something to tell you!” Lin Jiufeng said.
 Princess Yulin, who was in the palace, was stunned. She hurriedly stopped her current activity and rushed to the Cold Palace.
 Bai Tiandi, who was in seclusion, also came. Facing Lin Jiufeng now, even though he had already broken through to the False Immortal Realm, he didn’t dare to slack off at all and hurried over.
 In front of the Cold Palace, Bai Tiandi and Princess Yulin met.
 “Why are you here?” Princess Yulin asked curiously.
 “Mr. Lin called me here,” Bai Tiandi said.
 “I was also summoned here by Big Grand-Uncle,” Princess Yulin said.
 “Why did Mr. Lin call the two of us here at the same time?” Bai Tiandi was very apprehensive. He knew that Lin Jiufeng didn’t like him interacting with Princess Yulin. Was he going to break them up now?
 Princess Yulin rolled her eyes at him and said, “Big Grand-Uncle isn’t as petty as you think. He never said anything to me. Moreover, I’m here too, I will convince Big Grand-Uncle.”
 Bai Tiandi nodded and said, “That’s good. My legs go soft when I see Mr. Lin. I have no solution at all.”
 Princess Yulin was both speechless and amused. She walked into the Cold Palace that was hidden by the [Light of the Homes] and found that the door had already been opened.
 “Big Grand-Uncle!” Princess Yulin brought Bai Tiandi in and shouted.
 Lin Jiufeng sat in the courtyard. Seeing Princess Yulin and Bai Tiandi enter, he nodded.
 “Hello, Mr. Lin.” Bai Tiandi obediently greeted.
 “Big Grand-Uncle, why did you call us here?” Princess Yulin took the initiative to ask.
 “I’m going into seclusion for a period of time, I don’t know how many years it will take. During this period of time, if anything happens in the Yuhua God Dynasty, I probably won’t be able to help you, so I want to leave some trump cards for you guys!” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “Big Grand-Uncle is going into seclusion?” Princess Yulin asked in surprise.
 Lin Jiufeng nodded.
 “Mr. Lin, although you have intimidated all the Myriad Races now, the true powerhouses of the Myriad Races have yet to appear. They will definitely appear in the world in a few years. At that time, if they invade the Yuhua God Dynasty, I will sacrifice my life to protect the Yuhua God Dynasty,” Bai Tiandi said firmly.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at Bai Tiandi. Bai Tiandi was very serious. In front of Lin Jiufeng, he stood very straight, like a soldier who was being reviewed. He was so nervous that his muscles were tense.
 Princess Yulin watched worriedly from the side.  “How far into the relationship have you two advanced?” Lin Jiufeng suddenly asked.
 Bai Tiandi and Princess Yulin’s faces turned red. They didn’t dare to look at each other.
 “Big Grand-Uncle…” Princess Yulin shouted coquettishly.
 Bai Tiandi became even more nervous, unable to speak.
 “It’s normal for men and women to fall in love. You’re a big girl now, I just want to ask you both, what stage have you two advanced to?” Lin Jiufeng asked softly.
 His attitude was gentle and he wasn’t angry, making Bai Tiandi less nervous.
 “Mr. Lin, we are in love, but we abide by the rules of courtesy. We didn’t do anything overboard,” Bai Tiandi said. He raised his finger and said, “I swear that what I said is true.”
 Princess Yulin nodded lightly. She had only started to develop feelings for Bai Tiandi.
 “Not bad. Let me give you guys a gift. If you both get married in the next few years, I won’t be able to participate. This is a gift for you guys in advance.” Lin Jiufeng took out an iron rod from his God’s Domain.
 The God-Killing Rod!
 Boom!
 When the God-Killing Rod was taken out, a terrifying aura instantly erupted, causing the surrounding space to tremble. It was very powerful, giving Princess Yulin and Bai Tiandi a fright.
 “This is an immortal artifact from the Primordial God Mountain called the God-Killing Rod. It’s extremely powerful. The divine soul inside has already been wiped out by me. I’ll hand it to you now, make it your weapon and use it as a trump card. Protect Princess Yulin and the Yuhua God Dynasty well.” Lin Jiufeng handed the God-Killing Rod to Bai Tiandi.
 Bai Tiandi looked at it in surprise, not daring to accept it. “This is too precious. This is an immortal artifact, it’s better for Mr. Lin to use it.”
 Princess Yulin nodded. In the eyes of the people, immortal artifacts were very precious.
 Lin Jiufeng said coldly, “It’s fine if you don’t accept it. Then, break up with Princess Yulin now. You don’t have the strength to protect her or the Yuhua God Dynasty.”
 Bai Tiandi turned pale with fright.
 Princess Yulin’s expression changed. She slapped Bai Tiandi’s arm and complained, “This is a gift from Big Grand-Uncle. Why aren’t you accepting it? Hurry up and take it.”
 Bai Tiandi hurriedly took the God-Killing Rod from Lin Jiufeng’s hand and looked at Lin Jiufeng and Princess Yulin nervously.
 “Big Grand-Uncle, he has already accepted it. Do you have any other orders?” Princess Yulin asked with a fawning smile.
 When Lin Jiufeng saw this scene, he felt very tired in his heart. When girls grew up, their hearts really wouldn’t stay with their parents.
 “Go and master the God-Killing Rod. Remember this in the future—use the immortal artifact in your hand to protect Princess Yulin and the Yuhua God Dynasty well. Understand?” Lin Jiufeng looked at Bai Tiandi and said seriously.
 “Mr. Lin, don’t worry. Unless I die, the Yuhua God Dynasty and the princess won’t be harmed at all,” Bai Tiandi said firmly.
 “Take your leave. Remember, this immortal artifact used to belong to the Primordial God Mountain. If anyone from the Primordial God Mountain comes for it, you have to persevere.” Lin Jiufeng waved his hand and let them leave.
 Bai Tiandi and Princess Yulin could only leave. They didn’t dare to disobey Lin Jiufeng.
 After walking out of the Cold Palace, Bai Tiandi looked at the immortal artifact, God-Killing Rod. He seemed to be in a dream as he asked, “Does this mean that Mr. Lin acknowledged me?”
 Princess Yulin smiled faintly and said, “I guess so. You have to take advantage of this opportunity well. I’m still inspecting you.”
 “Don’t worry, I will definitely reach the standard.” Bai Tiandi was instantly filled with confidence and enthusiasm. He held onto the God-Killing Rod tightly, filled with fighting spirit.
 In the Cold Palace, the white cat asked, “You handed over the immortal artifact just like that?”
 “I don’t have a need for that God-Killing Rod. Let Bai Tiandi use it. He will definitely be able to utilize the might of this immortal artifact,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “You think so highly of Bai Tiandi?” The white cat asked curiously.
 “Yes, he’s the next pillar of support for the Yuhua God Dynasty. His talent is very terrifying!” Lin Jiufeng nodded. He had seen it with his own eyes.
 Bai Tiandi was actually only dozens of years old. He was even younger than Princess Yulin, but he had already entered the False Immortal Realm and had a promising future.
 The key was that Lin Jiufeng had observed him for a few years. He had seen the changes in Bai Tiandi’s character. He knew that Bai Tiandi wasn’t a pretentious person. To speak the truth, Bai Tiandi was very suitable for Princess Yulin.
 Since Princess Yulin had feelings for Bai Tiandi too, Lin Jiufeng wouldn’t go and break up this loving couple. Although he was still single, this didn’t mean he could stop others from having love partners.
 “You are going into seclusion now?” The white cat asked.
 “I’m going to the Forbidden City first!” Lin Jiufeng shook his head. He wanted to see Emperor De and discuss the reform of the Yuhua God Dynasty with him.
 The current world was turbulent and ever-changing. It was definitely not calm. Lin Jiufeng was no longer like before, where he could ignore the happenings of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Because once the Yuhua God Dynasty collapsed, billions of people would suffer a catastrophe. Lin Jiufeng had already come out from behind the scenes, so he couldn’t ignore it anymore.
 Lin Jiufeng walked into the room and laid on the bed. He closed his eyes and his Primordial Spirit left his body, heading for the Forbidden City.
 The Forbidden City and the palace had existed for hundreds of years. Even after experiencing trials and tribulations, it was still standing strong.
 Emperor De was dealing with state affairs. Previously, Lin Jiufeng had displayed his might in the convention of the Myriad Races and suppressed the Myriad Races. Emperor De took the opportunity to reform the world and implement a series of plans. Now, there were a lot of things that needed his decision.
 In the imperial study room, there were many officials coming and going. They delivered many memorials for Emperor De to review and issue orders. Then, they would send the orders to other state capitals. When the state affairs were in operation, Emperor De was the brain. Then, these officials were the meridians that drove the blood and made the giant called Yuhua God Dynasty become active.
 If the meridians were damaged, no matter how agile the brain was, this giant would still be a cripple.
 To this day, the number of officials in the Yuhua God Dynasty was simply unbelievable. After all, many officials were needed to manage the world.
 Emperor De was reviewing the memorials diligently. But suddenly, he felt a figure standing in front of him.
 Emperor De looked up and called out in surprise, “Big Grand-Uncle!”
 Lin Jiufeng looked at Emperor De. He nodded slightly and asked, “Do you have time to chat?”
 Emperor De immediately stood up and said, “Big Grand-Uncle, please sit.”
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t stand on ceremony. He sat down at the edge of the throne and watched as Emperor De put down the memorial.
 The other maids and servants didn’t hear the conversation between Lin Jiufeng and Emperor De. It was as if nothing had happened and they were still doing their own things.
 “Big Grand-Uncle, why are you here?” Emperor De asked curiously.
 “I’m going into seclusion for a few years, so I came to see your reforms,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “Big Grand-Uncle, there are too many things happening now. I’m so busy that I almost have to split myself apart into two.” Emperor De smiled bitterly.
 “Moreover, as the reforms continue to progress, I haven’t found a direction. In this current environment, which direction should the Yuhua God Dynasty be headed toward?” Emperor De asked Lin Jiufeng humbly, revealing a trace of confusion.
 Since Emperor Yuan’s time, there had been reforms all the way until now. Emperor De had reformed everything that he could think of.
 But the Yuhua God Dynasty still had many problems.
 “The reforms of the Yuhua God Dynasty should follow the principle of making the common people as the foundation, taking benevolence as the foundation, and promoting the integration of all the human races and the unity of the world. There are different races of humans, but they all have the same direction. Living and working in peace, cultivating the Dao, and ensuring the lives and wealth of the people. During this period, the reform of the law is the most important,” Lin Jiufeng said slowly.
 “The law?” Emperor De seemed to have thought of something.
 “In this world where cultivators can destroy the world, is reform of the law useful?” Emperor De asked.
 “On the outside, cultivators can destroy the world, but the inside of the Yuhua God Dynasty is peaceful. Why is the law useless?” Lin Jiufeng countered.
 Emperor De fell into deep thought.
 “Reform the old laws, do things according to the law, rule the country according to the law, let the people be able to rely on the law, and the officials have laws to follow. The law isn’t to increase the upper limit of humans, but to artificially establish a lower limit and tell the world what can and cannot be done. Let them know that for some things they do, they will break the law and will be punished. This is the meaning of the law,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 The chaos in Emperor De’s mind was split apart. Lin Jiufeng’s words were like an ax cutting through the laws of the old era.
 “Big Grand-Uncle is right. It’s time to reform the law.” Emperor De nodded. He suddenly had hope.
 “The reforms of the law must be to treat everyone equally. Even if it’s the royal family, those who make mistakes punishable by death should be killed. No special privileges are allowed. What we do must be for the benefit of the people. At the same time, we have to develop the wisdom of the people so that the common people at the bottom can learn to think. This is a very important matter.”
 “Even if the thoughts of the common people aren’t worth mentioning. Because of their own limitations, they only see one aspect of the problem, but it doesn’t matter. Instead, we have to encourage them to think more.”
 “In the history of the past, no one has ever treated the common people like us. As long as you are able to truly take the people as the foundation and be benevolent to them, in the future era, even if the Yuhua God Dynasty is wiped out, our spirit will never be wiped out because we have opened the minds of the people.”
 “The Martial Temples are very good. Continue to expand them, so that the Martial Temples won’t just become a place for the common people to cultivate. Some children aren’t talented in cultivation, but they are very talented in other places. Teach them according to their talents, making everyone a useful person in this society. At the same time, you have to treat the old and the disabled well, so that they can live in this world with dignity. These are the directions that you have to work hard in.”
 “When you are done with all of these, you will surpass all the emperors in history. You will be a benevolent emperor!”
 Lin Jiufeng explained slowly. Emperor De listened respectfully. His eyes became increasingly bright. He saw hope and the future.
 “Big Grand-Uncle, I will definitely do these things firmly. I’ll reform the world and develop the wisdom of the people,” Emperor De said in delight. He looked at Lin Jiufeng gratefully. When he was lost, Lin Jiufeng had brought him a brand new path to walk upon.
 A path that he had never imagined.
 “The prerequisite for developing the wisdom of the people is to abolish the slave system!” Lin Jiufeng said solemnly to Emperor De.
 “I also thought of abolishing the slave system so that everyone has a chance to surpass their current selves. But the resistance is huge. This is practically going against the aristocratic families of the entire Yuhua God Dynasty,” Emperor De said solemnly.
 “Remember, power comes from military might. As long as you control the military power of the Yuhua God Dynasty and the top powerhouses of the Yuhua God Dynasty follow your command, then no one will be able to stir up any waves. The wheel of history is rolling in. Whoever dares to stop it will be crushed into pieces. Even if you have to kill 100,000 people from the aristocratic families, you mustn’t hesitate to do so because you can obtain the support of tens of millions of slaves. The power that they bring will far exceed that of the aristocratic families. Under the banner of the Yuhua God Dynasty, these slaves are the future, and the aristocratic families are the past,” Lin Jiufeng said coldly.
 Emperor De murmured, “Power comes from military might. This is really well said.”
 “Remember, reforms aren’t treating others to a meal, nor are they something politely discussed. They are wars that will cause blood and fire, they are the shouts of the new era to the old era, and the solid foundation for the Yuhua God Dynasty to surpass all the previous God Dynasties. Everyone shall be able to enjoy a good life, and no one can take away their right to yearn for the good things.”
 “And you are the Emperor who will create this condition for them!”
 Lin Jiufeng said.
 “I will achieve this. I will compile what Big Grand-Uncle said into a book and publicize it so that the people of the world will know that each of them has the right to enjoy good things,” Emperor De said firmly.
 “All the best. Develop the Yuhua God Dynasty well. Be firm when carrying out the reforms. I’m going into seclusion for a few years. The troubles from now on will all depend on you to solve them.” Lin Jiufeng patted Emperor De’s shoulder and smiled.
 Compared to Princess Yulin, Lin Jiufeng placed more importance on Emperor De.
 Even though Emperor De’s cultivation was very weak and was far inferior to Princess Yulin’s, his ideals for reform and his ideals in the name of benevolence were something Princess Yulin couldn’t compare to.
 If anything happened to him, it would be very difficult for the Yuhua God Dynasty to find the next person who would firmly carry out the reforms.
 That was why Lin Jiufeng specially came over to talk to Emperor De.
 “Big Grand-Uncle, rest assured and go into seclusion. After the convention of the Myriad Races had passed, the Myriad Races had quieted down. With your deterrence, they won’t dare to make any move for the time being. My reforms will also borrow this momentum to forcefully be implemented. Even if I have to kill until rivers of blood flow, I will find a way out for the poor people of the world,” Emperor De said firmly.
 “Yes, don’t be afraid of the aristocratic families and the nobility. After freeing the slaves, even if only one in every 10,000 of them is a genius, the number of the talents gained will still drown the aristocratic families. In the future world, the might of the Yuhua God Dynasty will depend on your reform this time. The most important thing is publicity. You must occupy the high ground of publicity. Don’t be passive. Let the masses go against the aristocratic families and the nobility while you control everything from behind, understand?” Lin Jiufeng advised.
 Propaganda could turn all obstacles into rats that everyone wanted to kill. It could also gather the people’s support for the reforms.
 “Thank you for your guidance, Big Grand-Uncle!” Emperor De nodded forcefully.
 “Hmm, I shall take my leave first. And these officials of yours, there are too many of them here. Their positions have to be divided clearly. The division of labor must be detailed, and no one has to interfere with each other. Letting the imperial court operate perfectly is your current priority. After settling these, it will be easy for your orders to reach the bottom level of society.” Before Lin Jiufeng left, he saw Emperor De’s official system and gave him some pointers.
 Watching Lin Jiufeng leave, Emperor De let out a long breath. He looked at the memorials and the hundreds of officials working. He smiled and was full of energy.
 “Let the new reform begin from this imperial study,” Emperor De said softly. He had found his goal and was no longer lost. In the future, he would have a lot of things to be busy with.
 …
 After returning from the Forbidden City, Lin Jiufeng’s Primordial Spirit entered his body. Only then did he enter seclusion in peace and began to comprehend the Great Dao on a deeper level.
 He made backup plans. He had advised Emperor De of the path of the Yuhua God Dynasty. In the next few years, everything should be fine. He could now improve himself in peace.
 Following Lin Jiufeng’s seclusion, the Cold Palace became completely quiet. The little white cat didn’t go out either. She just guarded Lin Jiufeng and cultivated silently on her own, striving to make a breakthrough as soon as possible and reach a new realm.
 A year passed in a flash.
 In this year, nothing major happened in the world.
 Although the Myriad Races had recovered and many False Immortals had appeared, the world was still the same as before.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty continued to suppress the world and frantically carried out internal reforms. The Martial Temples expanded and formed countless schools to teach students. Not only did they teach the path of cultivation, but also other subjects.
 As usual, enrollment was free of charge.
 Because of this, the Martial Temples had truly become a gathering place for geniuses. As long as one was talented in cultivation, they would be heavily nurtured.
 Every term, hundreds of thousands of students would graduate from the Martial Temple. They were all geniuses of the era. They would enter the army of the Yuhua God Dynasty, becoming border guards or city guards to ensure the safety of the common people.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty didn’t expand outward, but its internal strength had increased by several times.
 The most obvious change was the vigorous reform of the law.
 Emperor De revised the law of the Yuhua God Dynasty. He publicly and impartially summoned the talents of the world to discuss and debate over each law. The parties involved in the debate could speak their minds freely. Finally, they would decide whether the laws were to be executed, whether they conformed to the public’s understanding, and whether they could restrain the crimes and ensure the safety of the people.
 The most conspicuous thing about the revising of the law was the abolition of the slave system.
 When this news spread, it really caused a huge commotion. Countless people stood up to oppose it.
 Since ancient times, no dynasty had abolished the slave system. Without slaves, how could the aristocratic families live a life of comfort? How could they freely order the people under their command? How could they buy maids to warm their beds?
 Even the ordinary people objected. They also thought about becoming rich one day and being able to buy slaves and maids to serve them.
 If the slave system was abolished, wouldn’t their hope be dashed?
 Although they were also poor now, they wouldn’t give up on the idea of oppressing others.
 This law caused a huge rebound among the people, and the court officials were also in a heated argument.
 In the end, Emperor De listened to Lin Jiufeng’s advice. Publicity was very important.
 He created the newspaper and publicized them widely. He told the poor people, the common people, and the wise people that if they didn’t want their future daughter to become someone else’s maid and their son to become someone else’s servant, letting their master rule over son’s and daughter’s life and death, then they should stand out and speak up.
 Emperor De was determined to abolish the slave system. No matter how big the rebound was, he wasn’t afraid. Because of Lin Jiufeng’s suppression of the world, the young people of the Martial Temple had received systematic education. They knew that this was right. They also supported Emperor De. The reforms began in a conflict of blood and fire.
 Emperor De established the slave monument and announced that all the slaves were to return to being commoners at this moment, no one was allowed to exploit them. The aristocratic families and the nobility had to disband the slaves and let them live the lives of ordinary people. The Yuhua God Dynasty would give them land, jobs, and dignity.
 Every day, the newspapers would promote the beautiful life the slaves would have after being freed from the slave system. The Yuhua God Dynasty would give them a sum of money as capital and give them the dignity that all people should have.
 The old would have land, the middle-aged would have work, the children would receive education and could cultivate for free. All of these were better than being a slave to others.
 With the reforms reaching this step, the aristocratic families could no longer stop them.
 Especially when Emperor De killed a few of the top aristocratic families in the world in a fit of anger. They had actually publicly refused to disband their slaves. The young mistresses and young masters of the aristocratic families couldn’t bear not having people to serve them. They couldn’t bear living a life not being able to order the slaves around, nor could they bear not being to look at the slaves in a high and aloof manner…
 These people thought that Emperor De was muddle-headed and couldn’t control everyone, so they refused to let the slaves leave.
 In a fit of anger, Emperor De directly used the newly revised slave law to sentence them according to the law, crushing these top families.
 After this, the other aristocratic families naturally didn’t dare to resist.
 This was the biggest thing that happened in the past year.
 Everyone, including the people of the Myriad Races, knew about this. All of them mocked the Yuhua God Dynasty. They actually completely offended the aristocratic families for a group of worthless slaves.
 When King Heaven of the Primordial God Mountain knew about this, he sneered. “The Yuhua God Dynasty is just seeking death. When I break out of my seal, these aristocratic families will immediately betray the Yuhua God Dynasty.”
 The powerhouses of Dreamcloud Lake also sneered. Each of them was treating this as a good show. There was even a powerhouse who directly said, “The Yuhua God Dynasty will be wiped out in the future. This is the trigger. If there wasn’t the Great Emperor Jiufeng now, the Yuhua God Dynasty would instantly be betrayed by this group of aristocratic families.”
 There were also clever powerhouses from Dreamcloud Lake who contacted the top aristocratic families, hoping that they would betray the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 In the Valley of Gods, a disdainful voice also sounded. It questioned the Yuhua God Dynasty. “Isn’t this group of aristocratic families more valuable than those slaves?”
 For the sake of the slaves, the Yuhua God Dynasty completely offended the aristocratic families. Was Emperor De of the Yuhua God Dynasty mentally disabled?
 Even the Nest of 10,000 Dragons in the Kunlun Mountains thought so too.
 Huang Xian’er asked Big Sister Divine Silkworm, “Recently, the Yuhua God Dynasty has been making a commotion about abolishing the slave system. What do you think, Big Sister? Are they seeking their own destruction?”
 Big Sister Divine Silkworm looked at Huang Xian’er and asked, “Why do you think so?”
 “How powerful are the aristocratic families? They have a lot of powerhouses and resources. Their rise in strength is very fast, and they also have a lot of geniuses. The Yuhua God Dynasty gave up such a huge force and instead chose those slaves who are lowly to the bones. Isn’t this seeking death?” Huang Xian’er asked.
 “Do the aristocratic families have more powerhouses than the Yuhua God Dynasty?”
 “Do the aristocratic families have more resources than the Yuhua God Dynasty?”
 “The geniuses of the aristocratic families will rise up very quickly, but do you know how many descendants of slaves there are?”
 “Among these descendants of the slaves, even if only one in every 10,000 or 100,000 is a genius, the overall number of geniuses can still drown the aristocratic families.”
 “The Yuhua God Dynasty has Martial Temples that teach students for free. Once these descendants of the slaves graduate, the power they bring will far exceed that of the aristocratic families. Moreover, their support towards the Yuhua God Dynasty is definitely more loyal than that of the aristocratic families. You actually say that the Yuhua God Dynasty is seeking its own destruction?”
 Big Sister Divine Silkworm frowned and said.
 “But abolishing the slave system has never happened before since ancient times. Even the Myriad Races have a large group of slaves. For the Yuhua God Dynasty to do this is equivalent to becoming an enemy of the world,” Huang Xian’er said.
 “This is why the Yuhua God Dynasty is different from the previous God Dynasties. Perhaps this is also the reason for their rise to power. During the past year, I transformed into a mortal human and wandered the world. What I saw and heard far exceeded my imagination. You might not know one thing.” Big Sister Divine Silkworm looked at Huang Xian’er with faint eyes.
 “What is it?” Huang Xian’er looked at Big Sister Divine Silkworm, puzzled.
 “Although the top powerhouses and False Immortals of the Yuhua God Dynasty cannot compare to the Myriad Races, the number of young powerhouses in the Yuhua God Dynasty from the King Realm and below is more than a hundred times that of the Myriad Races. Moreover, with the passing of time, one year later, it will be 500 times, and two years later, it will be 1,000 times. This is the reason why the Yuhua God Dynasty has liberated its slaves,” Big Sister God Silkworm said with a solemn expression.
 “How… How is this possible?” Huang Xian’er was shocked.
 “The Martial Temples can be enrolled for free. It’s compulsory for the children of the Yuhua God Dynasty to enroll, including the females. Those with a talent for cultivation will focus on the path of cultivation while those without talent can learn other things. Therefore, the Yuhua God Dynasty chose to treat the common people well, chose to free the slaves, and chose to free the women. What they want is the broad foundation of the common people, not just a little bit of people from the aristocratic families,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said with a shocked expression.
 “Ten years. In less than ten years, the Yuhua God Dynasty will have as many False Immortals as the Myriad Races. As for the realms below the False Immortal Realm, they will have more than 10,000 times that of the Myriad Races. This is because they place too much emphasis on education. Not only are the children important, but even the old people are studying and learning to strengthen their bodies.”
 “They are developing the wisdom of the people. They have done something that no one has ever done before. They have managed the Yuhua God Dynasty in a way that was unprecedented.”
 Big Sister Divine Silkworm said word by word. She looked at the shocked Huang Xian Er and asked, “Do you still think that the Yuhua God Dynasty is seeking its own destruction?”
 “How dare they do this? Developing the wisdom of the people? Aren’t they afraid that the people will become difficult to manage?” Huang Xian’er couldn’t understand.
 In the past, the God Dynasties mainly dealt with the common people by treating them as fools. The more foolish the common people were, the easier it was for them to rule. How could there be a dynasty like the Yuhua God Dynasty that took the initiative to develop the wisdom of the common people and let them learn to think?
 “But from what I know, the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty have an abnormally strong love for the Yuhua God Dynasty. After the Yuhua God Dynasty unlocked the wisdom of the people, the people became even more passionate towards their country.” Big Sister Divine Silkworm exhaled, calmed herself down, and said with complicated emotions.
 “Then, Big Sister, how should we handle our relationship with the Yuhua God Dynasty?” Huang Xian’er asked worriedly.
 “You said that they will surpass the Myriad Races in ten years. Then, can we restrain the Yuhua God Dynasty or even destroy it?” Huang Xian’er asked fiercely.
 “Who’s going to handle Great Emperor Jiufeng, you?” Big Sister Divine Silkworm looked at Huang Xian’er calmly.
 “Pretend I didn’t say anything,” Huang Xian’er said dejectedly.
 To the Myriad Races, Lin Jiufeng was indeed an insurmountable mountain.
 “We can only wait for the ancestors to recover. The World Chains aren’t as stable as before now,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said softly.
 …
 The reforms were carried out heatedly, but Lin Jiufeng, who was in the Cold Palace, didn’t notice this at all.
 He sank into the comprehension of the Great Dao, unable to extricate himself from it. He focused on improving himself.
 The white cat also quickly broke through to the Spirit Platform Realm outside, giving birth to a Spirit Platform Space. Her strength had now advanced another step.
 But she still couldn’t transform.
 The white cat was in despair.
 “Will I never be able to transform in my entire life?” The white cat became afraid.
 She didn’t want to be a cat forever.
 “If I hadn’t met him, being a cat wouldn’t be a bad thing. I would live freely.”
 “But now that I’ve met him…”
 “He’s so outstanding, I want to accompany him forever.”
 “As his wife!”
 The white cat was depressed. She looked at Lin Jiufeng who was in the room, her eyes dimming.
 “I shall work hard to break through to the Void Returning Realm and the False Immortal Realm. I don’t believe that I won’t be able to transform for the rest of my life,” the white cat said fiercely.
 The only fortunate thing was that Lin Jiufeng had always been alone. He didn’t come into contact with many women, and there weren’t any relationships between them.
 The white cat still had a chance.
 “Wait for me to transform and become the cat-eared girl for you alone,” the white cat muttered in her heart.
 Time flew by.
 In a flash, five years passed.
 In the past five years, Lin Jiufeng had been lying on the bed without opening his eyes.
 Great Dao entangled his body, transforming into endless halos that shrouded Lin Jiufeng.
 Daoist techniques materialized!
 This was Lin Jiufeng’s improvement. Moreover, the extent of his improvement far exceeded the little white cat’s imagination.
 The little white cat would look at Lin Jiufeng every day to ensure that he was fine.
 Then, she would start cultivating.
 Lin Jiufeng’s deduction was very accurate.
 Now, the little white cat’s cultivation speed was becoming faster and faster with the improvement of her realm. In five years, she leaped from the Spirit Platform Realm to the Void Returning Realm.
 Moreover, it was a very high level of the Void Returning Realm.
 Next, she could work hard to cultivate to the peak of the Void Returning Realm and then aim for the False Immortal Realm.
 But the problem was that she still hadn’t transformed.
 The white cat was really speechless. She was already at the Void Returning Realm. Even those monsters with very powerful bloodlines could also transform in this realm, right?
 But she couldn’t.
 Not knowing what exactly happened to her bloodline, the white cat was depressed.
 In the past five years, the little white cat completely ignored the happenings in the outside world. She only occasionally looked at the Forbidden City to ensure Emperor De’s safety. As long as nothing happened to Emperor De, the Yuhua God Dynasty would be fine.
 “Let’s continue cultivating. After I break through to the False Immortal Realm, I should be able to transform,” the white cat muttered.
 In the outside world.
 Due to Emperor De’s diligent reforms and the reforms of the laws, the Yuhua God Dynasty suddenly burst out with unlimited vigor.
 Geniuses were really like carps crossing the river, constantly appearing. In just five years, the Yuhua God Dynasty had gained millions of King Realm cultivators, and they were all young students.
 In this era of spiritual energy recovery, these students had the strong support of the Yuhua God Dynasty. They have free secret manuals, free education, and free pointers.
 Breaking through was simply too easy for them.
 As for the False Immortal Realm, the Yuhua God Dynasty also had hundreds of them. This was already comparable to the False Immortals of the Myriad Races.
 Big Sister Divine Silkworm had said that the number of False Immortals of the Yuhua God Dynasty would only be able to compare to them after ten years, but she had obviously underestimated the potential of the Yuhua God Dynasty and the powerful desire of the ex-slaves in rising up.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty hadn’t mobilized a single soldier for the past five years, but the might of the nation was hundreds or thousands of times greater than five years ago.
 Maybe it was because the Yuhua God Dynasty had just been quietly developing itself, but this year, the Wo Nation from overseas took the opportunity to join forces with the aristocratic families in the Yuhua God Dynasty to launch a surprise attack.
 Millions of troops entered the Yuhua God Dynasty, wanting to establish a country that belonged to them, a country in the truest sense of the word, and not the kind that would struggle to survive on small islands overseas.
 And because of the slave reforms six years ago, the aristocratic families and the vassals of the Yuhua God Dynasty united and cooperated with the Wo Nation to overthrow the four states along the coast.
 After Emperor De received the secret file from Princess Yulin regarding this, he took a look at it. Then, his eyes turned cold, but he didn’t get angry. He only sneered.
 “I’ve been waiting for you guys to jump out on your own and give me an excuse to kill all of you. You guys have indeed lived up to my expectations.”
 Emperor De immediately wrote a letter and got the Martial Temples in the state capitals along the coast to take action. He ordered them to wipe out the Wo Nation and the aristocratic families, using killing to stop the killing and announcing the might of the Yuhua God Dynasty to the world.
 The letter was sent out overnight. Within an hour after receiving the letter, the Martial Temples in the four states mobilized ten False Immortals and thousands of students. They charged into the base camp of the Wo Nation and caught them off guard.
 Under the watch of the False Immortals, the students experienced a bloody battle to temper themselves. They also killed all the people from the Wo Nation.
 And in this battle, the descendants of the aristocratic families were crushed by the commoner geniuses that they had always looked down on.
 None of the geniuses from the aristocratic families could defeat the commoner geniuses nurtured by the Martial Temples.
 This night’s battle results spread throughout the world early the next morning.
 The entire world was in an uproar!
 The Wo Nation wasn’t weak. They also had seven to eight False Immortals. Moreover, they also had a lot of powerhouses at the Void Returning Realm, Spirit Platform Realm, and King Realm.
 But they were all killed by the Martial Temple branches in the four states.
 These were just the Martial Temple branches in four states.
 The Martial Temple branches in the other places didn’t provide support, and the base camp of the Martial Temples outside the imperial capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty didn’t even move.
 The Martial Temple branches in the remote four states along the coast actually easily wiped out a faction that was very powerful in the eyes of the world.
 What kind of terrifying thing had happened?
 For the first time, the people of the world felt the terror of the Martial Temple.
 This Martial Temple that Emperor De had placed high hopes on finally revealed its fangs and bit the Wo Nation to death with one bite.
 Just as the people of the world were shocked, the Uniformed Royal Guards also went around plundering and exterminating the aristocratic families. Within these aristocratic families, those people who took participation in the scheme of the Wo Nation were either killed or arrested. The other members weren’t harmed at all, but their properties were going to be confiscated. Therefore, from being the members of an aristocratic family, they were turned into commoners.
 A corner of the Yuhua God Dynasty’s terrifying claws and teeth that were hidden under its calm exterior was revealed.
 All of the Myriad Races trembled.
 They were now anxious to see if their ancestors could escape the Chains of Order and come out to suppress the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 In the Primordial God Mountain, King Heaven shook the Chains of Order and roared, “Heavenly Dao, you won’t be able to trap me for long. The Chains of Order are becoming weaker and weaker. I will go out soon and destroy this world!”
 The Heavenly Dao didn’t respond at all.
 “Give me another year and I can break free from these chains in advance!” King Heaven roared. He was very irritable and also confident.
 A year later, the Yuhua God Dynasty would be destroyed by him!

                    



 Chapter 260: Recovering from Nirvana (Part 1)  It had been six years since Lin Jiufeng started his seclusion to comprehend the Dao of the seven supreme powerhouses.
 In these six years, he was completely immersed in it. He couldn’t extricate himself from it. He was immersed in the sea of Great Dao, comprehending everything.
 In his spiritual consciousness, the world was destroyed and then recovered. His Dao, his combat techniques, and his comprehension of the world were all affected by the seven supreme powerhouses.
 Although Lin Jiufeng’s body was still at the second stage of the False Immortal Realm, his Great Dao was countless times richer.
 Time slowly flowed. Here, Lin Jiufeng slowly transformed.
 As for the outside world, a huge change was also happening.
 Another year passed.
 In this year, the little white cat broke through to the False Immortal Realm. After breaking through, her cultivation speed sped up. It was very easy for her to improve, and it was no longer as difficult as before when she was at the Martial Sage Realm.
 But she still couldn’t transform.
 The little white cat fell into despair.
 “Could it be that I have to become a real immortal before I can transform?” The white cat’s eyes dimmed.
 She felt that her dream was like the moon in the water, forever impossible to realize.
 Because of this, for a period of time, she was in a very low mood.
 In this year, the world was safe and sound. The Yuhua God Dynasty was constantly reforming. More and more powerhouses appeared, causing the power of the Yuhua God Dynasty to become stronger and stronger.
 The current Myriad Races didn’t dare to go against the Yuhua God Dynasty at all. Even without considering Great Emperor Jiufeng, the current strength of the Yuhua God Dynasty was enough to make the Myriad Races fear it.
 The Myriad Races were waiting for the right time.
 When their ancestors broke free from the Chains of Order, it would be the time to declare war on the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Hence, they kept a low profile and didn’t provoke the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 As for the Primordial God Mountain, it erupted on this day.
 Boom!
 The huge fluctuations of the Chains of Order of the Heavenly Dao created crashing sounds that shook the world.
 Everyone at the False Immortal Realm could hear it. Someone was roaring angrily. Wild energy was charging at the Chains of Order, breaking them apart.
 Ka ka ka!
 The indestructible Chains of Order showed signs of collapse.
 The huge black ancient divine mountain was also trembling. Surging black smoke surged as a terrifying demon frantically broke free from the Chains of Order.
 “Nine Nether World, Netherworld Great Technique, Rebirth Cycle!”
 “Heavenly Dao, you can’t suppress me. I’m going to break free today, no one can stop me!”
 “Break!”
 King Heaven’s huge wings spread out, covering the sky and sun. It was extremely terrifying. A dense aura erupted and gathered into a terrifying Dao nomological power, competing with the world, the sun, and the moon.
 Boom!
 The thick Chains of Order finally began to collapse as they were pulled apart inch by inch by King Heaven.
 At this moment, King Heaven’s terrifying aura swept through the world.
 Rumble!
 This part of the world was dim and without light. Black fog curled up, and a terrifying aura akin to a nightmare surged frantically into the distance.
 The ordinary people of the Yuhua God Dynasty watched in surprise and doubt. What kind of terrifying energy was this? They trembled in fear.
 Could it be that after a few years of peace, another terrifying existence that could destroy the world had appeared?
 In the Forbidden City, Emperor De watched silently with a solemn expression.
 Behind him, Princess Yulin, who had also entered the False Immortal Realm, said, “It’s that terrifying existence from the Primordial God Mountain. Big Grand-Uncle fought with him six years ago and took away his immortal artifact. Now that he has appeared in the world, he will definitely come to our Yuhua God Dynasty to take revenge.”
 “Troublesome times. Big Grand-Uncle is in seclusion, who else can stop this King Heaven?” Emperor De asked softly.
 “There’s someone. Big Grand-Uncle has already set up a contingency plan,” Princess Yulin said firmly.
 “Bai Tiandi?” Emperor De wasn’t surprised. He had long known that Princess Yulin and Bai Tiandi were together.
 “He has been very hardworking for the past six years. He has been working hard all this time because he wants to protect the Yuhua God Dynasty well at such a crucial moment,” Princess Yulin said.
 “Where is he?” Emperor De asked.
 “He has already gone to the borders!” Princess Yulin said with a complicated expression. She was very worried about Bai Tiandi, but for the sake of the Yuhua God Dynasty, she had no choice but to let Bai Tiandi go.
 Everyone in the world knew that the enmity between the Primordial God Mountain and the Yuhua God Dynasty couldn’t be resolved. After King Heaven appeared, he would definitely kill his way into the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 And in the current Yuhua God Dynasty, only Bai Tiandi could resist his attacks.
 Even if the others had the same cultivation base as Bai Tiandi, they weren’t qualified enough.
 “I hope he can persevere,” Emperor De said solemnly.
 “Yes, he definitely will. Big Grand-Uncle won’t choose the wrong person.” Princess Yulin clenched her fists. She hid her worry, anxiety, and guilt in her heart.
 She was willing to believe in her own judgment of people.
 At the same time, she felt very guilty. Because of her, Bai Tiandi now had to face an extremely terrifying opponent.
 Rumble…
 At the end of the horizon, a terrifying divine mountain was trembling. In the extremely dense black fog, nine terrifying ancient beasts appeared, each of them at the False Immortal Realm.
 Moreover, they weren’t just ordinary False Immortals. They were infinitely terrifying ferocious beasts from 15,000 years ago.
 They ran out. They looked ferocious and had peerless auras. Their bodies were huge.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 The Chains of Order exploded one by one. An ancient demonic god-like body appeared. Stepping on the black fog, he tore off all the shackles on his body and roared into the sky.
 Roar!!!
 A torrential aura spread out. A terrifying figure, a pair of black wings that blotted out the sky, and a terrifying aura shook the world.
 At this moment, countless False Immortals were trembling. They felt that this was incredible. Through the endless distance, in the misty Primordial God Mountain, they saw a pair of green eyes revealing a terrifying light. They could vaguely see a tall figure, like a Demon God!
 King Heaven had truly descended into this world.
 His soul-stirring eyes looked at the world, especially at the Yuhua God Dynasty. His gaze pierced through the air and made many people tremble.
 King Heaven’s eyes were very strange. His left eye was a black sun, and his right eye was a blood moon. It was exceptionally terrifying.
 He roared into the sky, letting out an excited sound.
 “Heavenly Dao, you’ve trapped me for all these years, but it’s still useless. I still descended. Among the Myriad Races, I’m the first!”
 “This world shouldn’t be ruled by humans. Instead, it should be ruled by the Myriad Races. The Primordial God Mountain shall be the tomb digger of this era and shatter the glory of the Human Race.”
 “The Human Race’s Yuhua God Dynasty should be destroyed!”
 When King Heaven appeared, he said words that shook the world.
 With an extremely terrifying aura, he announced to the world that it was time for the Yuhua God Dynasty to be destroyed. It was time for the Human Race’s dream to rule the world to dissipate.
 The nine terrifying ancient beasts that appeared first were also roaring at this moment.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!!
 They pulled an ancient war chariot and stepped across the sky. The sound they made was like the divine drums of the ancient Heavenly Courts beating. It reverberated through the clouds and spread throughout the world, shocking everyone.
 These nine False Immortal-level ancient ferocious beasts could only pull the carriage in front of King Heaven.
 The ancient bronze war chariot was pulled over. King Heaven sat in it and looked sharply in the direction of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 “Go. I want to slaughter the world. I want to use a rain of blood to announce the decline of the Human Race and the rise of the Myriad Races.” King Heaven instructed coldly, showing no mercy. He opened his mouth and immediately talked about slaughtering the humans in the world.
 Boom!
 The nine ancient ferocious beasts started moving. They pulled the ancient war chariot with a rumbling sound. It broke through the clouds and headed for the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Such an appearance was shocking, making one’s body turn cold and their hair stand on end.
 The ancestor of the Primordial God Mountain, King Heaven, didn’t stay for a moment in the Primordial God Mountain. Instead, he rode a war chariot and headed straight for the Yuhua God Dynasty, wanting to slaughter the people of the world. Wasn’t this too ferocious?
 Countless people in the world witnessed this terrifying scene.
 In the distant horizon, the nine ancient ferocious beasts were each more ferocious than the other. Demonic aura surged, and they were all at the False Immortal Realm. Moreover, they were at least at the third stage of the False Immortal Realm, the Aspect Golden Body Realm.
 In any faction, they would be very powerful existences, but in front of King Heaven, they were just tools to pull the chariot.
 Behind the nine ancient beasts, huge divine chains flickered with a cold light. These were Chains of Order.
 A portion of the shattered Chains of Order was grabbed by King Heaven and tied to this ancient war chariot.
 The war chariot was covered in blade scars and arrow holes. King Heaven stood on it like a demonic god, suppressing the entire world until it seemed to be about to collapse. Wherever he passed by, the void collapsed and a chaotic aura lingered.
 This shocking scene made one’s scalp turn numb.
 The hearts of everyone from the Human Race clenched. This was too terrifying. Would the Yuhua God Dynasty be able to defend against such an existence?
 Ordinary people couldn’t see the specific scene, but they could feel the terrifying aura. Breathing was difficult as if doomsday had arrived.
 At this moment, they could only secretly pray that the Yuhua God Dynasty could stop this person.
 They prayed that Great Emperor Jiufeng would once again display his might and save the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Compared to the anxiety of the Human Race, the Myriad Races were excited.
 The people of Dreamcloud Lake who had been driven out of the Hundred Thousand Mountains by Lin Jiufeng were watching excitedly.
 “King Heaven came into being in advance and broke free from the Chains of Order to kill his way to the Yuhua God Dynasty. This is simply great.”
 “Since King Heaven can escape, that means that our old ancestor can also escape very soon. This world ultimately belongs to the Myriad Races. The humans must be wiped out. But letting King Heaven take action personally is already being too kind to them.”
 “There’s no need to worry. After King Heaven’s massacre, the humans won’t be able to be completely wiped out. There are too many of them. It’s just that the Yuhua God Dynasty will be wiped out. No matter how powerful that Great Emperor Jiufeng is, he won’t be a match for King Heaven.”
 “That’s for sure. King Heaven is a powerhouse from the era of the Myriad Races, the ancestor of the Primordial God Mountain. He has walked to the end of the False Immortal Realm, the fake Great Emperor Jiufeng wouldn’t be able to resist him at all.”
 “I’ll watch from here and see how the humans are killed. Only then can the hatred in my heart lessen a little.”
 The monsters of Dreamcloud Lake spoke one after another with hatred in their eyes. They couldn’t wait for Lin Jiufeng to be killed, the Yuhua God Dynasty to be wiped out, and the Human Race to be slaughtered.
 Other factions such as the Barbarians of the Northern Region and the Valley of Gods were watching the commotion with malicious intentions.
 The Ancient Kunlun Mountains.
 In the Nest of 10,000 Dragons, the conversation between Huang Xian’er and Big Sister Divine Silkworm was still going on.
 “The Yuhua God Dynasty probably won’t be able to withstand it this time. King Heaven is too powerful,” Huang Xian’er said.
 “I think so too.” Big Sister Divine Silkworm agreed with Huang Xian’er, which was rare.
 Huang Xian’er was overjoyed.
 “But a voice in my heart is telling me that the Yuhua God Dynasty can withstand it and that King Heaven will suffer a loss.” Big Sister Divine Silkworm’s words changed, causing Huang Xian’er to look at her in surprise.
 “That’s King Heaven, a powerhouse from the era of the Myriad Races. He’s not an ordinary False Immortal. He has at least walked seven steps in the False Immortal Realm!” Huang Xian’er said solemnly as she refuted Big Sister Divine Silkworm.
 “I also know that King Heaven is very powerful, but I still believe in the Yuhua God Dynasty and that they can resolve this crisis. I wonder if it’s because I’m too confident in the Yuhua God Dynasty or because the Yuhua God Dynasty has given me too much confidence?” Big Sister Divine Silkworm laughed at herself and said.
 “Sister thinks so highly of the Yuhua God Dynasty?” Huang Xian’er didn’t understand.
 “Because there has never been a God Dynasty like the Yuhua God Dynasty. I actually don’t want the Yuhua God Dynasty to be wiped out now. I hope that they will continue and create countless miracles,” Big Sister Divine Silkworm said faintly.
 She didn’t meet Lin Jiufeng, nor did she meet Emperor De, but she was so confident in the two of them. This was something that Huang Xian’er couldn’t understand.
 “Sister, watch carefully. Now that King Heaven is making a move, he will definitely overthrow this world. He’s full of anger now,” Huang Xian’er said confidently.
 Big Sister Divine Silkworm said softly, “I’m watching.”
 Boom!
 As soon as Big Sister Divine Silkworm’s words fell, something happened. A small ancient city far away at the borders of the Yuhua God Dynasty was now empty. The common people had long been moved away.
 There was only one person here.
 A young man leaned against the opened city gate and watched as the terrifying ferocious beast pulled a chariot and passed by. The terrifying aura they brought seemed to be able to instantly turn the city into dust.
 This person was Bai Tiandi.
 After accepting the immortal artifact, God-Killing Rod, he had never let down his guard in the past few years. He worked hard in his cultivation and was crazily mastering the immortal artifact. His cultivation level had shot to the sixth stage of the False Immortal Realm, the stage of Breathing of Immortal Energy.
 Every stage of the False Immortal Realm was completely different from the other stages. From the initial Opening of the Three Flowers to the Forming of the Five Energies, then the Aspect Golden Body, the Heaven’s Heart and Will, the Wind and Fire Tribulation, and the Breathing of Immortal Energy.
 Bai Tiandi’s cultivation speed was even faster than the little white cat’s. It could be seen how talented and hardworking he was.
 Now that King Heaven was passing by, Bai Tiandi raised his head and grinned.
 “I accepted Mr. Lin’s immortal artifact, and the person I love the most is in the Yuhua God Dynasty, how can I let you slaughter humans of the world?”
 As Bai Tiandi spoke, he took out the God-Killing Rod and struck the air ruthlessly.
 Boom!
 Suddenly, a world-shattering sound rang out. The God-Killing Rod let out a resplendent golden light. At this moment, it streaked across the vast land from the ancient city. It resonated with the Heavenly Dao and rushed into the sky, instantly killing the nine ferocious beasts pulling the war chariot.
 Rumble!
 At this moment, the power of the God-Killing Rod shocked the entire land.
 The resplendent golden light was like an eternal divine radiance that illuminated the mountains and rivers, entering King Heaven’s eyes.
 His pair of Yin and Yang eyes revealed boundless sharpness. “God-Killing Rod!”
 King Heaven recognized the immortal artifact that once belonged to him. His expression was cold as he looked at Bai Tiandi high up in the sky.
 “Hand over the God-Killing Rod, and I can take you in as my godson and make you the successor of the Primordial God Mountain.” King Heaven ignored the deaths of the nine ferocious beasts and stared fixedly at Bai Tiandi and the terrifying God-Killing Rod.

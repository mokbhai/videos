Chapter 161 Only a Pi  “They are… using our vitality and magic power as energy to help them open the spatial passageway.”
 “They are trying to let the Devil Immortals in!”
 “It’s over, it’s over!” Everyone was shocked. They were not ready to die. However, if these Devil Immortals were allowed to open the passage, the group of holy land experts believed they deserved death.
 Yet, they were currently restrained by the Devil Immortal’s domain and suppressed and devoured by the demonic black line.
 They could not resist at all. In fact, the holy land experts could not even self-destruct.
 They could only allow themselves to be manipulated like a marionette as they watched a spatial circle appear in the black vortex and slowly expand.
 More demonic aura surged out from the point.
  At this moment, they finally understood why the Lingtian Mystic Realm had become a wasteland or even abandoned.
 It was probably related to the Devil Immortals. “We shouldn’t have entered this Immortal Court, and we shouldn’t have broken through that restriction!”
 Everyone was filled with regret, but it was clearly too late.
 Their vitality and magic power were dissipating. Amongst the group, the weaker ones had already begun to faint.
 As for Perfected Tian Hui, Perfected Biyao, Perfected Qing Xiao, and the other stronger experts. They were struggling to hold on. They waited in despair for death to arrive.
 They knew they could not hold on for much longer, and they had committed a grave sin today.
 They had cultivated for hundreds or thousands of years. They had painstakingly built up their powers, but they had failed to subdue the demons to defend their Dao. Instead, they had helped in the Devil Immortal’s invasion.
 This was more painful than killing them.
 Soon, Perfected Taiqing fell into a coma. Perfected Tian Hui, Perfected Biyao, and Perfected Qing Xiao were also on the verge of death.
 In their blurry vision, terrifying devils flew in from the spatial passageway.
 They knew that their mistake had been made!
 However, just as Perfected Tian Hui, Perfected Biyao, Perfected Qing Xiao, and the others were about to close their eyes in despair and fall into the endless darkness and chaos, a figure appeared in front of them.
 A blurry figure descended from the sky, accompanied by a sword light.
 Boom!
 The roars of the devils and the loud booms became the last thing they heard.
     

 In their blurry vision, they seemed to have seen the bodies of the Devil Immortals falling while the spatial passageway collapsed.
 They did not know if it was all a final illusion or a miracle had really occurred.
 Nonetheless, their brains could no longer distinguish or think.
 They were soon unconscious. “No!” The furious roars of the devils echoed through the hall.
 The spatial gate that had just opened was destroyed by a single strike from Li Yu.
 Li Yu did not expect to end up here after falling into the shattered space of the Demon God Palace.
 When he saw the figures of Perfected Taiqing and Perfected Wan Chu, he was sure that he had returned to the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 The scene in front of him immediately made him realize the danger of the situation. Therefore, he did not hesitate to attack the moment he appeared.
 A serious strike slashed through the void.
 The newly opened spatial passageway and the devils that flew out collapsed under Li Yu’s sword.
 The surrounding area collapsed directly too.
 This world shook as circles of ripples appeared in space. The three Devil Immortals that had opened the spatial door roared as they charged at Li Yu, but they were also reduced to dust by Li Yu’s sword.
 As for the demonic energy in the hall, it was devoured by the Demon Spirit Pearl again.
 “Ding… successful collection of three paragon bones!”
 “Ding… successful collection of Ancestral Demon Di Jiang’s Soul Essence!” “Ding… successful collection of White Tiger Blood Soul!”
 The system’s voice kept sounding, and Li Yu had obtained many precious treasures again.
 However, what made him the happiest was not collecting these treasures but his rapidly soaring experience points.
 “Holy shit, did I just wipe out the Devil Immortals? They gave me so many experience points!” Li Yu was excited.
 When he saw his experience bar change from 7.07% to 3.1415926% away from becoming invincible, Li Yu immediately felt the pleasure of slashing 999 damage.
 He was now only short of a ! “They’re still breathing!” Li Yu checked everyone’s condition one by one. Other than the few elders who were already coming of age had no vitality in them, the others were still alive.
 Although Li Yu did not know most of them, he could roughly guess.
 They were probably the top experts of the human orthodox sects and the Holy Lords of the Holy Lands.
 Li Yu took out some Immortal Spring water from the system space for them to drink. As the Immortal Spring water entered their stomachs, their vitality slowly recovered, and their auras stabilized. They should have no problem staying alive.
 “The Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s treasure is nearby!” Li Yu realized that his target was nearby when he checked the system’s mission interface.
 He did not expect to arrive beside the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s treasure just like that.
     

 Li Yu did not have the time to care about Perfected Taiqing and the others. In any case, they should not die after drinking the Immortal Spring He followed the system’s directions and headed for the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s treasure alone.
 In the end, he found a damaged token in the ruins of the Immortal Court. It would have been difficult to notice it without the system’s
 Li Yu studied it for a long time and did not know how to use this token, so he took out the Mi Lu Immortal Palace and brought Ye Qiu out. “Help me study this token.” Li Yu handed the token to Ye Qiu.
 If Ye Qiu was a fated person in the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s treasure trove, he might have a way to activate this token.
 “Oh!” Ye Qiu took the token and looked at it carefully, feeling somewhat puzzled.
 He was already curious when Li Yu brought him out alone. Now that he saw this broken token, he was even more puzzled.
 Regardless, he studied the token carefully. There were complicated words engraved on it, but it seemed to have the words ‘Ancient Emperor.’ Ye Qiu studied it for a while and quickly thought of a method to use blood essence.
 Sure enough, a miracle happened after his blood entered the title plate.
 The token automatically flew up and grew in the wind. In the end, it turned into a large door that slowly opened from the middle.
 Ye Qiu looked at the door in surprise, then looked at Li Yu.
 “Let’s go. This is an opportunity that belongs to you!” Li Yu said with a smile before bringing Ye Qiu to approach the door.
 In the Great Zenith Domain, the Divine Firmament Holy Land. A bloody battle had just ended.
 Like the Primordial Dao Holy Land, the Divine Firmament Holy Land’s defense was breached after Young Master Qing Ye’s arrival.
 After the earth-shattering battle, although the demons suffered heavy losses, the Divine Firmament Holy Land had fallen into the hands of the demons.
 Meanwhile, the Violet Palace Holy Land was still struggling on the verge of defeat. As for the news that the Primordial Dao Holy Land, the Divine Firmament Holy Land, and the Violet Palace Holy Land had been invaded by the demons, the word finally spread.
 It was like a meteorite falling into the sea, causing a mighty uproar and panic among the various factions of the Great Zenith Domain.
 The elders of the Divine Pool Holy Land, the Grand Primordium Holy Land, and the Million Swords Holy Land quickly gathered the various large sects and factions of the Great Zenith Domain to discuss a strategy.
 After all, this was a war between humans and demons, and humans should be united in life and death. If the demons really occupied the various Holy Lands, the human cultivators in the Lingtian Mystic Realm would never return.
 Therefore, the various Holy Lands, cultivation families, eternal empires, and large sects rapidly gathered their strength and took the initiative to attack.
 They quickly gathered at the Primordial Dao Holy Land as they prepared to fight the demons and reclaim it.
 However, as the orthodox cultivators of the human race were engaged in an intense battle with the demons in the Primordial Dao Holy Land…
  The top of the Demon Sons of Heaven Rankings changed hands again. The Nine-Headed Lion race’s prodigy, Xin Ba, who had been pushed to second place by Long Yue, suddenly returned to first place again.
 His cultivation level had also reached the initial stage of the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 “Hahahaha, my son, Xin Ba, has also broken into the Immortal Spirit Realm!” Lion King Xin Teng, who was leading the allied army of the demons to the battlefield of the Divine Firmament Holy Land, was delighted.
 This also boosted the morale of the Nine-Headed Lion race.
 However, while he was happy, Lion King Xin Teng was still somewhat worried.
 After all, Li Yu should be inside the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm. This fellow was ridiculously monstrous, and he hoped that his son would not encounter Li Yu.
 Furthermore, Gu Yuqi, who was ranked second on the Human Race’s Sons of Heaven Rankings, and the people from the Qingyun Sect were like thorns on their backs.
 Over the past few days, new names from the Qingyun Sect climbed onto the rankings, while the cultivation levels and placings of those already on it had been increasing rapidly.
    
Chapter 162 The One Who Saved the World was Li Yu  After Li Yu and Ye Qiu entered the door formed by the token, they discovered that it was another sealed space. Looking at the structure, it was like an underground palace.
 After they entered, the door slowly closed and transformed into an intact token that automatically fused into Ye Qiu’s body.
 At the same time, complicated golden runes suddenly surfaced in the void of the hall, turning into golden lights that flew into Ye Qiu’s body.
 Ye Qiu looked surprised, but he quickly sensed that the runes turned into an abundance of information that fused into his memories.
 This was the legacy!
 Ye Qiu immediately sat cross-legged on the spot and closed his eyes to meditate. His body was bathed in golden light, and his aura kept rising
 Before long, a golden light shot out from the roof and entered Ye Qiu’s body. That golden light also emitted an impactful magic power fluctuation.
  Under the infusion of the golden light, Ye Qiu’s cultivation began his breakthrough, and his body was transforming at a visible speed.
 His aura grew stronger, and his skin seemed to turn golden.
 Time continued to pass. Under the baptism of the golden light and those inscriptions, Ye Qiu’s transformation continued.
 Li Yu could only become a supporting role this time since there was nothing else to do in this enclosed space.
 However, Li Yu guessed that if Ye Qiu was not the reincarnation of Ancient Emperor Qing Cang, he must be a descendant of Ancient Emperor Qing Cang. He must have obtained exclusive recognition of the bloodline.
 Therefore, only Ye Qiu could open the treasure and obtain the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s succession.
 Based on Ye Qiu’s current changes, this inheritance could probably help Ye Qiu catch up to Gu Yuqi.
 Over a day later, the golden light finally dissipated, and the hall returned to peacefulness.
 Ye Qiu also awakened from his meditation. At this moment, he had already undergone a tremendous change. His aura was extremely powerful, and his appearance and bearing were even more extraordinary.
 ance a  ere      

 His skin seemed to be plated with a layer of golden light, but as Ye Qiu opened his eyes, the golden light slowly disappeared.
 “How is it, Junior Brother?” Li Yu asked impatiently. “I obtained the cultivation technique inheritance of Ancient Emperor Qing Cang’s Firmament Tyrant Body Art and the magic power infusion he left behind. I now have the Firmament Tyrant Body, and my cultivation has stepped into the late stage of the Mahayana Realm!” Ye Qiu reported excitedly. “Very good! Haha! I didn’t expect you to have such a great opportunity, kid!” Li Yu patted Ye Qiu’s shoulder happily. His sect now had another heaven-defying freak.
 “Isn’t this all thanks to senior brother? How did you know that I could unlock this place?” Ye Qiu finally asked his burning question.
 “I can understand the workings of heaven! Haha!” Li Yu joked, naturally not explaining to Ye Qiu.
 “You’re my Senior Brother for a reason! I admire you as a junior!” Ye Qiu knew that Li Yu was joking.
 However, he knew that Li Yu never made wild guesses. Li Yu must have known something. “Are there any other treasures here?” Li Yu changed the topic.
 “Well, yes. Senior Brother, follow me!” Ye Qiu had obtained the inheritance, so he naturally knew everything here.
 He used the token to open a passage and walked up the stairs to the first floor. Many treasures, cultivation technique manuals, immortal jade and crystals, and other precious items were stored there.
 Ye Qiu wanted to donate all these treasures to Li Yu and the sect.
 However, Li Yu refused. He had already accumulated a ton of wealth from the Demon God Palace, so everything here was not as valuable in his eyes.
 “You can just contribute the cultivation technique manuals to the sect. You can have the rest for yourself!” Li Yu said.
 “Alright, then thank you, senior brother!” Ye Qiu did not stand on ceremony.
 In the Immortal Court, Perfected Tian Hui, Perfected Qing Xiao, Perfected Biyao, Perfected Taiqing, and the others had already awakened.
 Although their cultivation had been damaged and their lifespan had been reduced considerably, they were still alive.
 After a day of adjustment, their magic power had recovered by 70-80%.
 Everything that had happened yesterday was like a dream, but they were well aware that it was all real.
 The corpses of the Devil Immortals and the demonized god statue indicated everything.
 They had almost committed a grave mistake and almost brought disaster to everyone.
 They were curious who had stopped the invasion of the Devil Immortals and saved them.
 “Before I fell unconscious yesterday, I vaguely saw a godly figure descend from the sky and destroy the Devil Immortals’ spatial gate with a single move!”
 “Did you see that person clearly?”
     

 “No, my vision was blurry, and I was already losing consciousness. I didn’t even know if what I saw was an illusion!”
 “Who could it be? Could it be some powerful restriction in the Immortal Court has been activated, and it has transformed into a sword god to stop all of this!?”
 “It’s possible. Back then, in order to prevent the Devil Immortals from making a comeback, the Immortal Court must have had a plan!” Someone guessed. “No, I think that’s a person, a living person!” Perfected Tian Hui asserted with certainty.
 “Perhaps there are sword immortals who survived in this Immortal Court back then?”
 “It can’t be! Aren’t the three people we saw earlier the only survivors? They have clearly been breached by the demonic thoughts and turned into Devil Immortals!”
 “It can’t be one of us, right? To be able to kill such a terrifying devil, I really can’t think of anyone in our Great Zenith Domain who can do it! Plus, why would he suddenly appear and leave without a word!”
 “I thought of someone. Although I’m not sure, I keep feeling that it might be him!” the Grand Elder of the Grand Primordium Holy Land, Perfected Wan Chu, suddenly remarked.
 “Who is it?” Everyone looked at him curiously.
 “Li Yu!”
 “Li Yu?” Everyone was filled with disbelief, but the eyes of the Grand Primordium Holy Lord, Perfected Chu Yang, and the Clear Void Holy Lord, Perfected Taiqing, brightened slightly.
 Perfected Chu Yang had previously heard from Perfected Wan Chu that Li Yu had killed Emperor Tianyun.
 However, as he did not see it with his own eyes, he could not experience the shock that Perfected Wan Chu had felt and Li Yu’s power.
 “Does Elder Wan Chu have any basis?” Everyone asked.
 “I once saw with my own eyes that this child killed Tian Yunzi and destroyed the grand array formation that was enough to trap and kill immortals in one slash! Just one casual strike that did not have any magic power fluctuations destroyed Tian Yunzi and that powerful grand array formation!”
 Perfected Wan Chu recalled seriously. Thinking back to the scene then, he was still incomparably shocked.
 Everyone was shaken by his words, and they felt that it was highly possible.
 “Soon after, I thought about what his unknown cultivation level represented. It might be a ridiculously high cultivation level!” Perfected Wan Chu continued.
  Everyone could not calm down for a long time.
 Perfected Taiqing added, “Li Yu declared he cultivated a self-created system. Although I don’t know if it’s true or not, it should have a lot to do with his unknown cultivation. I think what Elder Wan Chu mentioned is highly possible. Li Yu is indeed unfathomable. If the person who saved us yesterday was really someone from our Immortal Martial World, then Li Yu is definitely the most likely one!”
 “This child created his own cultivation system?” Perfected Taiqing’s analysis shocked the Holy Lords of the various Holy Lands.
 “Yes, and he was the one who spoke the Great Dao mantras earlier!” Perfected Taiqing added. If not for the fact that Li Yu was likely their savior, Perfected Taiqing would not be willing to take the initiative to mention Li Yu’s glorious achievements.
 “Those Great Dao mantras were spoken by Li Yu!” The shock in everyone’s hearts could not be any greater. The information they received in this short time was more shocking than the previous
 However, various signs seemed to outline the truth.
 Yesterday, this person destroyed the spatial passageway and killed those Devil Immortals.
 The hero who saved everyone was none other than Li Yu!
    
Chapter 163 Everyone Becomes Immortal  After Ye Qiu obtained the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s treasure, Li Yu brought Ye Qiu to the Misty Immortal Island again.
 Over the past few days, his junior brothers and sisters had spent money on cultivation, and their cultivation levels had increased significantly.
 This also comforted Li Yu. He was confident that he could have at least five or six immortals after they left the Lingtian Mystic Realm this time.
 With the many treasures he possessed now, it was not a problem to nurture a few Immortal Spirit Realm cultivators.
 It might even involve everyone!
 “Junior Brother Yu Qi has already reached the peak of the Mahayana Realm yesterday. He drank the Dao Comprehension Tea brewed from the Immortal Spring and is in seclusion comprehending the Great Dao. He should be able to break through soon!” Tang Chi reported excitedly.
 Seeing that Gu Yuqi was about to enter the immortal level, Tang Chi seemed to see his future touching on the path to immortality that he had never dared to think about.
  He was the only person who had witnessed such a miracle.
 In just a few months, with the help of Li Yu, he leaped from ordinary trash to a top genius.
 Now, his cultivation realm was already comparable to the top prodigies of the various Holy Lands.
 He would have a chance for a carp to leap through the dragon’s gate to become an immortal in the future.
 Tang Chi felt excited, and just thinking about it made him feel as if he was dreaming.
 After returning from this trip, he planned to return home to visit his aged parents.
 He could also let those who looked down on him in the past admire his new life.
 As they spoke, the Heaven and Earth powers of the Misty Immortal Island suddenly fluctuated violently. Then, the Great Dao aura transformed into a dragon-like airflow that gathered towards Gu Yuqi’s seclusion.
 Everyone was delighted to see this.
 “Gu Yuqi has broken through!” Li Yu revealed a look of joy, even though he had never witnessed someone becoming an immortal.
 Such a phenomenon did not require much thought to know that Gu Yuqi must have broken through to the Immortal Spirit Realm and was about to become an Immortal.
 “Elder Nie, is this the phenomenon of stepping into the Immortal Spirit Realm?” Ji Qinglan inquired.
 Old Nie’s remnant soul appeared and nodded. “Yes, that’s right!”
     

 Hearing the confirmation from Elder Nie, everyone from the Qingyun Sect was thrilled, but they did not disturb Gu Yuqi’s breakthrough
 Li Yu took out the Red Lotus True Flame from the system space and handed it to Wu Chang. “Wu Chang, this is the true fire I got somewhere. Take it and fuse with it. Also, this immortal pill should be enough for you to attempt to break through to the Immortal Spirit Realm. If you can enter the Immortal Spirit Realm and develop an immortal body and Dao fetus, I have a few drops of the blood essence of the Ancestral Demon, Zhurong!”
 Upon seeing the Red Lotus True Flame, Wu Chang was so ecstatic that flames burst out of his eyes.
 As a natural oddity, he could cultivate to improve his cultivation and strength.
 However, if he wanted to change the limits of his life and improve his cultivation and strength in the fastest way, fusing more powerful fire-type monsters was the best option.
 Therefore, the Red Lotus True Flame was the same as Wu Chang as Long Yue obtained the Azure Dragon Bloodline. They were both methods to defy the heavens and change fate.
 As long as he fused with this Red Lotus True Flame. He could advance to True Fire. That was a qualitative transformation.
 Moreover, Li Yu had given him the Red Lotus True Flame on par with the Life Spirit Flame. It was one of the best True Fire.
 However, Li Yu’s remarks shocked Elder Nie to the extreme.
 His focus was different from Wu Chang’s. He was shocked by the Ancestral Demon Zhurong’s blood essence that Li Yu had mentioned.
 “Li Yu, you actually obtained the blood essence of an Ancestral Demon!” Old Nie exclaimed. Perhaps others did not know what the blood essence of an Ancestral Demon signified, but he knew very well that it was a priceless treasure, far more precious and valuable than the True Fire.
 That was the way to obtain the power of an Ancestral Demon. It was a power that truly belonged to a god.
 In the past, when he was in the immortal realms, the blood essence of the Ancestral Demon was enough to cause wars between countries and factions.
 It was said that only the top fellows in the Immortal Domain possessed the blood essence of the Ancestral Demons.
 He did not expect Li Yu’s fortune to obtain such blood essence. Furthermore, he was too generous to give it to Wu Chang directly.
  Even Elder Nie was a little envious and wished he could make Li Yu his master.
 As long as he clung to Li Yu’s thigh, becoming an immortal was entry-level treatment. Becoming a true god was not a dream!
 “Oh, right. Is this Ancestral Demon’s blood essence very precious?” Li Yu was curious after he saw Elder Nie’s reaction.
 He had obtained a lot of divine beasts and Ancestral Demon blood essence in a row this time, and he had even collected the Soul Essence of the Ancestral Demon Di Jiang.
 Therefore, after obtaining too many treasures at once, it gave him the illusion that they were not too valuable.
 Although Li Yu knew that the blood essence should be valuable, he could not gauge how precious it was.
 “Of course, this is the blood essence of an Ancestral Demon!” Elder Nie began to explain the value of the blood essence to Li Yu and the Qingyun Sect disciples.
 Everyone was surprised as well. Only then did Li Yu understand how precious this blood essence was.
 The treasures he obtained from the demon god and the Devil Immortals were really powerful!
     

 I could just give the Di Jiang Soul Essence to Dad. I’ll develop my father into the strongest person in the world besides me! “Another question, Elder Nie. What level is that paragon bone?” Li Yu asked. “A paragon bone? You obtained a paragon bone?” Elder Nie was shocked again.
 “Yeah, roughly over ten!” Li Yu added.
 “More than ten?” Elder Nie felt that his soul was about to be scattered by the shocking amount of information.
 This was the first time he had heard of someone obtaining more than ten paragon bones.
 Li Yu must have destroyed the few big shots at the top of the Immortal Domain!
 Or did he directly kill a Sovereign?
 It had to be known that even for a Sovereign realm expert, condensing a single paragon bone was not an easy task.
 “The paragon bone is a priceless treasure comparable to the Ancestral Demon blood essence. In fact, the value of a single paragon bone far surpasses a drop of an Ancestral Demon blood essence. This is a bone condensed from the Great Dao’s nomological power and one’s own blood essence. Its power and value are even greater than a paragon artifact!”
 Elder Nie began to explain ceaselessly.
 “This magic treasure is divided into Spirit Artifacts, Immortal Artifacts, Dao Artifacts, and Ancient Saint Artifacts. Ancient Saint Artifacts are already extremely precious in the entire Immortal Domain, and they are like phoenix feathers and Qilin horns. As for Paragon Artifacts, they are treasures that are superior to Ancient Saint Artifacts. So if you take a closer look, how precious is this Paragon Bone!? To be able to fuse with a single Paragon Bone is basically invincible in the same realm.”
 After hearing what Old Nie said, the disciples of the Qingyun Sect felt their breathing quicken.
 How many treasures did my Eldest Senior Brother gather in one go?
 Compared to the Ancestral Demon’s blood essence and the Paragon Bones, the various spirit herbs and immortal pills seemed like appetizers.
 “Hmm, looks like I really obtained a lot of treasures this time!” Li Yu finally realized how many precious items he had obtained from the Demon God Palace.
 Wu Chang happily took the treasure bestowed by Li Yu and entered seclusion to cultivate. He was now grateful for his wise choice.
 “Ye Qiu, this immortal pill and Dragon Origin Fruit are for you. You should try to break through to the Immortal Spirit Realm too! In a while, I’ll give you another supreme bone to fuse with!” Li Yu took out another supreme bone and handed it to Ye Qiu.
 Ye Qiu had obtained the most treasures in the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s treasure vault, saving him a lot of resources.
 Therefore, he decided to reward Ye Qiu with a sovereign bone.
 “Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother!” Ye Qiu was also thrilled. He immediately took the immortal pill, the Dragon Origin Fruit, and the paragon bone and went into seclusion to cultivate.
  “Tang Chi, this sacred medicine is for you, but you can only consume it when you reach the Mahayana Realm. Take this Paragon Bone and nine drops of divine beast Chao Feng’s blood essence for refinement. Then, use the Dragon Origin Fruit and the immortal pill to break through to the Mahayana Realm and eventually break through to the Immortal Spirit Realm with the holy medicine!”
 “Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother. You’re the best!” an agitated Tang Chi hugged Li Yu.
 He did not expect his dream to become a reality that easily.
 Nor did he expect Li Yu to treat him so well either.
 Not only did Li Yu give him the sacred medicine, but he also gave him the blood essence and paragon bone of an Ancestral Demon.
 He was going to forcibly turn himself into a peerless genius like Gu Yuqi.
 He could not help but recall Li Yu’s words back then. “Even if you’re a pig, I’ll make you soar into the sky.”
 Yep! If possible, I want to continue being Li Yu’s pig. Uh, his junior brother in my next lifetime!
    
Chapter 164 Dao Seeking Tower, the Clamor of the Nine-Headed Lion Race   “Junior Brother Ji, I’ll give you one set too. Go into seclusion. I’ll give you an even greater fortune later!” Li Yu gave Ji Qinglan the Dragon Origin Fruit and the Paragon Bone.
 Although Ji Qinglan’s journey into the sect resulted from a bet, he was still his junior brother, so Li Yu would naturally treat him equally.
 Of course, the main reason was that the system reminded him that Ji Qinglan’s Pan Emperor Immortal Abode mission was about to begin. Li Yu felt that Ji Qinglan might not need his sacred medicine to enter the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 Thus he would save this sacred medicine for other juniors, who needed it more for the time
 being.
 “Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother. Thank you!” Ji Qinglan was endlessly grateful as he bowed deeply.
 He was very grateful to Li Yu because he knew that he could not compare with Ye Qiu and Tang Chi in terms of initial relations.
  He was touched that Li Yu could treat him equally. He was even more glad to become a Qingyun Sect disciple through a freak combination of factors during his bet with Li Yu. Otherwise, how could he have his current achievements?
 “Go on, you may begin your seclusion!” Li Yu smiled.
 Ji Qinglan cupped his hands again and went into seclusion to cultivate.
 “Li Yu is really generous. Qinglan, with this Paragon Bone, you can probably compare with the peerless geniuses of those top orthodox sects in the Immortal Domain!” Elder Nie remarked.
 “Mm, I was right to listen to Elder Nie back then. It’s my fortune to enter the Qingyun Sect! It’s a pity that my Ninth Brother separated from us for some reason. If he was here, he might have been able to receive Eldest Senior Brother’s reward. Sigh…” Ji Qinglan thought of Ji Wanjie again.
 However, the Blood Spirit Monarch had just flown out of the Blood Ancestor’s immortal abode. He was in high spirits and filled with ambition.
     

 His aura had undergone a tremendous change.
 “Immortal Spirit Realm. I, the Blood Spirit Monarch, have finally become immortal. Haha! From now on, I don’t have to be afraid of that Li Yu anymore. I don’t have to hide my identity anymore!” The Blood Spirit Monarch laughed confidently.
 His solo venture into the Lingtian Mystic Realm was filled with danger.
 Although he entered the Blood Ancestor’s immortal abode, he was almost possessed by the remnant soul of the Blood Ancestor. Fortunately, the backlash from the Demonic Blood Body caused the Blood Ancestor to fail.
 He had also fused with a portion of the Blood Ancestor’s blood power and obtained the supreme opportunity in the immortal abode.
 He transformed from a cocoon into a butterfly and stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm, entering the realm he had always yearned for.
 Now that he had become a true immortal, he became more confident and fearless.
 He believed that no one was his match in the Lingtian Mystic Realm, not even Li Yu.
 He was so confident that he simply wanted to conquer the Lingtian Mystic Realm!
 Gu Yuqi’s entry into the Immortal Spirit Realm caused a stir in the entire Immortal Martial World, giving countless human cultivators another shot of confidence.
 Most importantly, Gu Yuqi was still only ranked second after stepping into the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 This also proved that the unknown cultivation behind Li Yu might be beyond everyone’s imagination.
 Of course, with Li Yu and Gu Yuqi around, the panic brought by Xin Ba’s entry into the Immortal Spirit Realm lessened significantly.
 It gave the terrified human world some support and comfort because of the war between the demons and the Holy Land.
 However, the flames of war between the demons and humans were still burning.
 The alliance formed by the Grand Primordium Holy Land, the Jade Pool Holy Land, the Million Swords Holy Land, the Clear Void Holy Land, and other human factions had failed to retake the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 Instead, the various Holy Lands were about to face the threat of Young Master Qing Ye and the unthinkable outcome of being occupied by the demons.
     

 Young Master Qing Ye’s name had already spread throughout the world, and many rumors about him had spread.
 Some said that he was the young master of a large faction in the Immortal Domain.
 Some said that he was an old monster who had been sealed for millions of years.
 Some said he was from the Lingtian Mystic Realm and the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm.
 Regardless of where he came from, one thing was certain. He was exceedingly powerful. He would bring an unprecedented calamity to the humans of the Immortal Martial World.
 In the Qingyun Sect of the Great Xia Dynasty.
 Li Qingyun had naturally heard about the Great Zenith Domain. He heard that the Primordial Dao Holy Land, the Divine Firmament Holy Land, and the Violet Palace Holy Land had already been occupied by the demons. The remaining four Holy Lands were also in danger. The human race was about to face an unprecedented crisis and calamity.
 Li Qingyun was also shocked when he first heard the news.
 He mourned for the Divine Firmament Holy Land for a long while. Although he was chased out of the sect, that was still a place he spent his youth, a land he once called home.
 If he had Li Yu’s capability, he would definitely rush over immediately to save the Divine Firmament Holy Land.
 It was a pity that he did not have that ability
 now.
  However, he did not panic by any means. It was not because he had Li Yu as his backing.
 He knew better than anyone that the human race was not that easy to suppress and destroy. He felt that the so-called Young Master Qing Ye was either a young master from the Immortal Domain who had nothing better to do, who had come to the lower realm to abuse his power and make his presence known. Or he was a guy in the late stage of middle school syndrome.
 Since ancient times, it had always been a struggle between the races. No race had ever actually ruled this world.
 In the past, when the human race was at its peak, they did not entirely rule this world. The demon race could still compete with the human race.
 Did Qing Ye assume that there was no one left in the human race and the seven Holy Lands?
 Which family did not have some backing to become a Holy Land that had stood firm for countless years? Even if the demons occupied the seven Holy Lands, it was a pipe dream to rule this world.
 Of course, there was another possibility that Li Qingyun felt was the most likely.
 This person called Qing Ye definitely did not intend to help the demons rule this world.
    
Chapter 165 Dao Seeking Tower, the Clamor of the Nine-Headed Lion Race (2)  Qing Ye’s main objective was the seven Holy Lands, the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 As for what he wanted to do, only time would tell.
 …
 In the Lingtian Mystic Realm, Li Yu rested on the Misty Immortal Island and enjoyed himself for a few days.
 Seeing that the Pan Emperor Immortal Palace mission had begun, he left Misty Immortal Island again to find the Pan Emperor Immortal Palace according to the system’s guidance.
 On the way, he encountered people from the Jade Pure Dao Sect.
 “Elder Li, why are you alone?” Perfected Yu Hua was concerned. “Oh, my junior brothers are all in seclusion, inside a secret immortal abode.” Li Yu explained briefly. Perfected Yu Hua heaved a sigh of relief. He thought that they had encountered a mishap and got separated.
  “Elder Li, the Dao Seeking Tower has appeared. I heard that the disciples of the various families had rushed over. Would you like to travel there together?” Perfected Yu Hua offered.
 Dao Seeking Tower?
 Li Yu’s eyes flashed. He had heard his father mention this name before.
 He recalled that it was located in the Lingtian Mystic Realm’s Heavenly Pivot Domain, an excellent area for training and obtaining opportunities.
 At the time, Li Yu had thought of bringing it to the Qingyun Sect to train his disciples.
 “Alright, let’s go together!” Li Yu nodded.
 As Li Yu followed Perfected Yu Hua to the Dao Seeking Tower, many cultivators from the various Holy Lands and sects had arrived near the Dao Seeking Tower in succession, waiting for its official opening.
 It was the fixed area in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 Every time the Dao Seeking Tower opened, it would attract many human cultivators to come and train.
     

 After all, there was no danger to their life here. They could also better their combat experience and improve strength. They could also obtain generous rewards.
 Many cultivators had already gathered in front of the Dao Seeking Tower.
 Other than the people from the various large sects and cultivation families, everyone from the Divine Firmament Holy Land, the Clear Void Holy Land, and the Violet Palace Holy Land had arrived.
 “Congratulations, Brother Chen. Your cultivation has improved significantly!”
 “Congratulations to you too! Brother Wu seems to have obtained good fortune! Your cultivation should be on par with mine, right?”
 The Holy Sons and young geniuses of the various Holy Lands gathered and conversed.
 “I heard that Senior Brother Chu of the Primordial Dao Holy Land has already entered the Mahayana Realm!”
 “Hmm, Senior Brother Chu is indeed the son of destiny. We can’t compare ourselves to him. I believe that Senior Brother Chu will probably surpass Night Whisper after leaving the Lingtian Mystic Realm this time!”
 “Hey, look, disciples from the Primordial Dao Holy Land are here!”
 A group of people flew over from the sky. They were from the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 A commotion broke out among the crowd as many people went forward to welcome them.
 After all, Chu Yunhe was the Eldest Senior Brother of the sect. No matter where he went, he would be the center of attention, and the people from the various Holy Lands would take the initiative to greet him.
 It was no exception this time.
 “We welcome our Eldest Senior Brother Chu!” The young elites of the various families said in unison.
 “Junior Brothers and Sisters, greetings!” Chu Yunhe was polite as he returned the greeting with a warm smile.
 “Congratulations, Senior Brother Chu. You’re indeed the Eldest Senior Brother of our orthodox sect with such extraordinary fortunes. It’s only been a while, and you’ve already entered the Mahayana Realm!” Wu Qian walked forward and flattered him with a smile.
 “Indeed, you have really left us in the dust!” someone added.
 “Senior Brother Chu is already at the late stage of the Mahayana Realm!” A young disciple of the Primordial Dao Holy Land announced proudly.
 The moment he said it, everyone exclaimed in amazement.
     

 Chu Yunhe was still in the Tribulation realm before entering the Lingtian Mystic Realm. They did not expect him to step into the late stage of the Mahayana Realm directly.
 He might even encounter a great opportunity to directly ascend to the Immortal Spirit Realm and truly become an immortal in a few more days.
 “He’s already at the late stage of the Mahayana Realm! Senior Brother Chu’s luck is really breathtaking!”
 “Congratulations, Senior Brother Chu! You’ll definitely get the top spot in the Dao Seeking Tower this time. You might even become an immortal directly with the rewards!”
 “Indeed, indeed! With Senior Brother Chu’s luck and talent, he definitely has such a chance!” Everyone echoed.
 “Everyone, you’re too kind. I was simply lucky enough to obtain some opportunities!” Chu Yunhe replied humbly.
 “Mwahahaha! This place is quite lively!!!”
 A burst of arrogant laughter suddenly sounded from above. It was like rolling thunder that resounded through the entire sky.
 The thousands of human cultivators in front of the Dao Seeking Tower looked over to see a large group of figures flying toward the tower from afar.
 These figures were tall and mighty. They had golden hair and brown or golden eyebrows. Upon seeing this group of figures, all the human cultivators present revealed startled expressions.
 They gasped in unison!
 Nine-Headed Lion race?
 Why are the demons here?
 Everyone was shocked.
 The Lingtian Mystic Realm should be filled with human cultivators. It did not even have any fiend sect cultivators around.
  How did these demons get in?
 “Tsk tsk, this must be the Dao Seeking Tower!”
 A young man in golden armor with a striking demeanor looked at the Dao Seeking Tower as he hovered in the air.
 Pr
 He was the number one prodigy of the demon race, the young master of the Nine-Headed Lion race, Xin Ba.
 Upon seeing Xin Ba, the expressions of the senior elders of the Violet Palace Holy Land, Divine Firmament Holy Land, and the others turned ugly, and they were even more shocked inside their minds.
 They realized that Xin Ba’s aura was unfathomable and seemed more powerful than anyone present. “Why are you here?” A human elder questioned coldly.
 However, the Nine-Headed Lions sneered and did not answer.
    
Chapter 166 Dao Seeking Tower, the Clamor of the Nine-Headed Lion Race (3)  “Oh yes, is that human Li Yu here?” Xin Ba asked instead of answering as he swept his gaze across the crowd.
 In the end, it stopped on Chu Yunhe, who had an extraordinary appearance and bearing. “You’re Li Yu?”
 “I’m Chu Yunhe from the Primordial Dao Holy Land!” Chu Yunhe replied solemnly. “Hmph, does the number one prodigy of the human race, Li Yu, dare to come out and compete with me, Xin Ba?” Xin Ba had an arrogant face as he looked down at the crowd below.
 At the moment he said it, another commotion broke out among the crowd below.
 They believed he was the number one prodigy of the demon race, Xin Ba.
 No wonder he looked so condescending.
 Everyone looked at each other. Most did not know much about Li Yu and did not know if he was here. At this moment, Zhou Yu of the Clear Void Holy Land replied, “Li Yu isn’t here!” “Hmph, how boring. If you see Li Yu, let him know I’m waiting for him here. Don’t be a coward. I want him to understand who the number one prodigy in the Immortal Martial world is!” Xin Ba roared.
  He had always been brooding over the additional reward given to Li Yu by the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 Now that he had stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm and obtained a tremendous fortune, he had already become a true lion divine beast, the Suan Ni.
 His power level was already worlds apart from before.
 In his opinion, even ten Li Yu was not his match.
 However, he must defeat Li Yu in public.
     

 Only then could he eliminate the dissatisfaction and unwillingness in his heart.
 “Alright, you can scram now. This place belongs to us Nine-Headed Lions now!” Xin Ba added.
 The crowd below became agitated and cursed once he said it.
 “Damn demons, what are you being so arrogant for!”
 “Hmph, did I hear that correctly? You should be the ones getting lost!”
 “Who did this ignorant fellow think he is? Do you think this is the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm? How dare you tell us to scram!”
 “You shit-eating fellow who comes to our territory only to show off!”
 Everyone rubbed their fists as they scolded.
 Since the humans controlled the Lingtian Mystic Realm, how could the demons be allowed to be arrogant here?
 However, no one dared to act rashly despite the anger in their hearts.
 “Senior Brother Chu, go teach this guy a
 lesson!”
 “Yeah. You’re at the late stage of the Mahayana Realm now. You’re definitely better than him. Let him witness the power of our human elites!”
 “Hey, you guys should be the ones getting lost!”
 “That’s right, demons, get out of our Lingtian Mystic Realm!”
     

 “Get lost!” Everyone vented their emotions angrily. After all, they felt that they had the advantage in numbers. Why would they be afraid of the Nine-Headed Lion race?
 As he heard the angry shouts of the human cultivators, Xin Ba frowned as a cold glint flashed in his eyes.
 A powerful Immortal Spirit Realm pressure immediately poured out as if the sky was pressing down, instantly enveloping everyone below.
 The human cultivators below went silent in an instant. And their expressions changed drastically.
 Some weaker ones could not withstand the terrifying pressure and kneeled on the ground with pale faces.
 Even Mahayana Realm cultivators found it difficult to breathe under the pressure of the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 “Xin Ba has already stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm!” An elder of the Holy Land exclaimed
 The human cultivators looked at Xin Ba with fear. They did not expect Xin Ba to have already stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 No wonder he was so arrogant and condescending.
 “It seems like you want to do this the hard way. Since you won’t bother to scram, you shall die!” Xin Ba waved his hand, and massive magic power smashed down like the might of the heavens.
 The people below were stunned. The elders and top experts of the various families immediately attacked together to block Xin Ba’s attack.
  Boom boom boom boom boom…
 The humans worked together to resist, but they could not thoroughly block Xin Ba’s attack.
 Dozens of human cultivators were severely injured, and a few were even killed on the spot.
 “Young Master, this is human territory after all. It’s better not to kill too much!” A Nine-headed Lion elder reminded.
 “Hmph, what’s there to be afraid of? So what if the Holy Lords of the various Holy Lands come? They’re still not my match!” Xin Ba sneered. Xin Ba was already arrogant. After he had obtained a great opportunity and transformed into the divine beast, the Suan Ni. He became even more imperious with his newly gained extraordinary strength. “How did demons come to our territory to misbehave!” At this moment, a voice boomed from the sky.
 Everyone looked over and saw a group of people flying from the sky.
 “It’s Li Yu!” Zhou Yu recognized the voice and the group flying over.
 They were Li Yu and the members of the Jade Pure Dao Sect.
    
Chapter 167 The Genius Excellence Ranking Is Simply Toxic! (1)  The Primordial Dao Holy Land, the Violet Palace Holy Land, and the Divine Firmament Holy Land.
 The Azure Dragon Race, the Nine-Headed Lion Race, the Holy Ape Clan, the Golden Feather Race, and the other demon alliance armies were regrouping. They were prepared to attack the Million Swords Holy Land, the Grand Primordium Holy Land, and the Jade Pool Holy Land.
 At this moment, the information of the latest person on the Genius Excellence Rankings in the sky was updated. Excellence Rankings # 22: Xin Ba
 Identity: Eighth Prince of the Nine-Headed Lion Race
 Origin: Demon Race’s Nine-Headed Lion Race
 Upon seeing Xin Ba on the rankings, a commotion broke out among the various demons. They all wanted to see the graceful bearing of the second demon to enter the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 However, Lion King Xin Teng had mixed feelings.
  On the one hand, he was happy and proud that his son was ranked 22nd on the Genius Excellence Rankings.
 On the other hand, what happened during Long Yue’s Elegance Exhibition left a shadow in Xin Teng’s heart.
 It made him feel uneasy and worried.
 Soon, Xin Ba’s Elegance Exhibition appeared in the sky.
 As a former member of the Immortal Domain, the Nine-Headed Lion race’s appearance and aura were naturally extraordinary.
 Xin Ba, who had stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm, was even more so. He was handsome and mighty. His golden hair and tall body gave him a different charm from those immortal-like cultivators of the human race.
 Xin Ba’s introductory scene was displayed. It was the scene of him suppressing thousands of human cultivators with a single palm in front of the Lingtian Mystic Realm’s Dao Seeking Tower.
 Upon seeing this, everyone watching the Genius Excellence Rankings was shocked.
 “Xin Ba actually appeared in the Lingtian Mystic Realm?”
 “How did he enter the Lingtian Mystic Realm!”
     

 “This is bad! Xin Ba has entered the Lingtian Mystic Realm. Wouldn’t our human cultivators be in danger!”
 The human cultivators were shocked, especially after seeing Xin Ba suppress the human cultivators alone.
 This made the human cultivators, who were terrified because the demons had declared war on the humans, feel even more miserable and fearful.
 The disciples of the various Holy Lands were also worried as they looked at the names of their disciples on the Heavenly Dao Rankings nervously.
 They were afraid that their names would turn gray in the next second.
 On the other hand, the demons had mocking expressions when they saw it.
 Li Yu had defeated Long Yue and made her his mount, bringing shame to the demons.
 They hoped that Xin Ba could reclaim their glory today and make the human cultivators in the Lingtian Mystic Realm taste the power of the demons and the fear of being dominated by them.
 Lion King Xin Teng heaved a sigh of relief. His son had entered the Lingtian Mystic Realm while Li Yu was in the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm.
 The two of them should not meet again.
 In that case, Xin Ba would surely not encounter something as embarrassing as Long Yue on the rankings today.
 The Azure Dragon Race had already lost all face. The Nine-Headed Lions did not want to follow in their footsteps.
 “Congratulations, Your Majesty!”
 “Congratulations!”
 “Today, we will use Young Master Xin Ba’s glory to take down the remaining four Holy Lands in one go!”
 ance on  “That’s right. Once we triumphed, we’ll celebrate Young Master Xin Ba’s appearance on the rankings!” The various demon elders and demon kings congratulated Lion King Xin Teng
 However, the introductory display in the sky ended, and the screen switched to a live broadcast. The scene was still the same-Dao Seeking Tower.
 At the same time, Xin Ba’s voice sounded. It was like a basin of cold water was poured on Lion King Xin Teng’s face.
     

 “You’re Li Yu?”
 Li Yu was not too surprised to see the nine-headed lion race here.
 Since he could enter the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm by mistake, it was not surprising for demons to enter the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 Furthermore, he had a nagging feeling that the Lingtian Mystic Realm and the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm were a little strange this time.
 With the appearance of such powerful devils in succession, the situation in these two mystic realms was likely changing.
 Furthermore, what his father speculated might happen soon. The two mystic realms were about to combine again.
 “You’re Li Yu?”
 Zhou Yu’s exclamation naturally could not escape Xin Ba, who was at the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 He carefully sized up Li Yu, and the arrogance on his face was slightly restrained. Li Yu was indeed extraordinary.
 Furthermore, there was no magic power fluctuation on his body. He was like a mortal without any cultivation, but his aura gave off an unfathomable feeling. Although he was still confident that he was stronger than Li Yu, he could not underestimate Li Yu.
 However, it was not only Xin Ba. The thousands of human cultivators below were also sizing up Li Yu in surprise.
 Other than Zhou Yu, Duan Tianming, Qin Yueheng, and a few others from the Clear Void Holy Land who had seen Li Yu before.
 Everyone else had only heard of him, but they had never seen Li Yu before. They had always been curious.
 Therefore, when they saw Li Yu, they could not help but be stunned by his appearance. They recognized that this child should be the number one prodigy of the human race.
 So this is Li Yu! He is truly peerless!
 As expected of the number one prodigy of our human race, he’s indeed otherworldly!
  Everyone exclaimed in their hearts.
 Li Yu had clearly surpassed Chu Yunhe, and each of them had their own style.
 Chu Yunhe looked more refined, while Li Yu looked more elegant and otherworldly.
 People could not help but sigh that this boy should only exist in the heavens! “The beauty in high places stood like jade, while the handsome young man was unmatched. Young Master Li is worthy of the number one prodigy of our human race!”
 “He’s so handsome and extraordinary!”
 Some young female disciples’ eyes sparkled as their hearts raced.
 Li Yu seemed to be the center of that world.
 He stood there without saying or doing anything. Yet, there was as if thousands of dazzling lights were gathering around him.
    
Chapter 168 The Genius Excellence Ranking Is Simply Toxic! (2)  Compared to him, it was as if the world had dimmed. As if everything around him was reduced to nothingness.
 And he was the only one in sight.
 “He’s Li Yu!” Chu Yunhe stared at Li Yu intently.
 He suddenly felt a sense of loss.
 He was the main character here and the center of attention not long ago.
 However, with Li Yu’s appearance, he instantly became a green leaf and became a spectator like everyone else.
 Furthermore, Li Yu’s vibe made him feel ashamed of his inferiority.
  However, Li Yu, who was the focus of the thousands of cultivators, examined the system interface that popped up in front of him carefully.
 It was similar to when he first saw Long Yue. It was an introduction to Xin Ba.
 This fellow had actually gained the inheritance of the divine beast’s blood soul and transformed from a nine-headed lion into a divine beast, the Suan Ni.
 “Divine beast, Suan Ni? Hmm, another potential mount!” Li Yu ignored Xin Ba and spoke to himself.
 His comments made Xin Ba frown. He was furious and shocked that Li Yu could see through his background.
 Other than a few elders, no one knew that he had obtained the divine beast, Suan Ni’s bloodline.
 The cultivators below were also shocked. They did not expect Xin Ba to have already transformed into the divine beast, Suan Ni. No wonder he’s so strong!
 However, Li Yu’s comments made them look forward to a good show.
 As expected of the number one prodigy of the human race, he is arrogant enough to say that Xin Ba is a potential mount!
 What he said was really cocky and satisfying! Many people present had no idea of Li Yu’s capability. However, since Li Yu dared to speak like this, he must have his trump card.
     

 Furthermore, his unknown cultivation and his additional reward are testaments to how extraordinary he was.
 Hence, everyone looked forward to seeing Li Yu bring glory to the human race and teach this Nine-Headed Lion a lesson.
 It could also be considered justice for the cultivators who had just died.
 “You’re seeking death!” Xin Ba squeezed out the words through gritted teeth.
 He did not expect that Li Yu was actually cockier than him. Li Yu deserved a beating for spouting such nonsense.
 As he spoke, his magic power surged out. His golden hair fluttered without wind, and his eyes were as cold as blades.
 The powerful aura sent chills down the spines of everyone below, and their expressions turned grim again. Xin Ba attacked first.
 His figure transformed into a golden stream of light that sped towards Li Yu.
 A powerful aura and magic power tore through the void, emitting a loud rumble that shook the area.
 However, in the next second…
 Boom!
 As soon as the golden stream of light arrived before Li Yu, it flew back at an even faster speed.
 It instantly smashed into the group of Nine-Headed Lions behind.
 Like a bowling ball, it sent the entire group of Nine-Headed Lions flying.
 In the end, Xin Ba crashed into the distant mountain.
 A cloud of dust soared into the sky, and the mountain collapsed with a bang. Trees fell, and sand and stones flew as loud rumbling sounded.
 Silence rang out.
 Everyone fell silent as they looked at the scene in the air in shock.
 The power of Li Yu’s punch was too terrifying. In fact, the space around his fist was twisting and fluctuating like a water surface that had been hit.
 “You think you’re worthy of clamoring in our human territory with this little ability?” Li Yu snapped coldly. “Gasp!”
     

 After a brief moment of silence and shock, the human cultivators below instantly cheered like a tsunami.
 At the same time, countless humans in the entire Immortal Martial World cheered almost at the same time.
 Li Yu’s punch had not only sent Xin Ba flying, but it had also shattered the face of the Nine-Headed Lion race and dispersed the pressure and gloom that the demons had brought to the human race over the past few days.
 Long Yue had been defeated by Li Yu and knelt down to become his mount.
 Xin Ba of the Nine-Headed Lion race would not escape the fate of becoming Li Yu’s mount today.
 “Haha, well done, well done!”
 “I don’t care if you’re a demon beast or a divine beast. You’re only fit to be Li Yu’s mount!”
 “Hahaha, this is too awesome. This is how it’s done!” The people immediately felt satisfied.
 Meanwhile, Lion King Xin Teng and the Nine-Headed Lions in the Divine Firmament Holy Land had ugly expressions.
 They could even see Long Yue’s fate repeating on Xin Ba.
 And the situation might be worse.
 “How could this be!” Xin Teng gritted his teeth so hard that they were about to break. Whatever he was afraid of had come true. Wasn’t Li Yu in the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm? How did he suddenly return to the Lingtian Mystic Realm? Maybe he could travel between two mystic realms freely?
 And how could it be a coincidence that he could meet Xin Ba just in time for the Genius Excellence Rankings to be updated?
 Did the Heavenly Dao Rankings do it on purpose?
 Xin Teng’s heart ached.
  And his face hurt even more.
 At that moment, it was not only the Nine-Headed Lions who went silent. The Holy Ape Clan and the Demon Ox Clan beside them were also silent.
 The battle between Xin Ba and Li Yu represented the confrontation between the number one prodigies of the human race and the demon race.
 Thus, when Li Yu sent Xin Ba flying, they felt ashamed as demons.
 They recalled the last time when Long Yue had just entered the Immortal Spirit Realm and got defeated by Li Yu in public after ascending the Genius Excellence Rankings. And as a result, she became Li Yu’s mount.
 Now it was Xin Ba’s turn.
 The Genius Excellence Ranking is simply toxic!
 As the dust slowly dissipated, a giant figure appeared on the screen.
    
Chapter 169 The Genius Excellence Ranking Is Simply Toxic! (3)  It was Xin Ba in the form of the divine beast, the Suan Ni.
 He lay flat on the gravel with his limbs facing the sky. His mouth was half-open, and his tongue was drooping as he foamed at the mouth.
 He had already fainted!
 Lingtian Mystic Realm, in front of the Dao Seeking Tower.
 The Nine-Headed Lions got up from the ground in a sorry state. Some had bloodstains on the corners of their mouths as they looked at Li Yu in the air in panic.
 They wanted to escape, but they were quickly surrounded by human cultivators. “Hmph, you think you can leave after killing our people!” Everyone glared. Xin Ba had killed and severely injured many people with a single strike.
 Previously, they were afraid of Xin Ba’s power and did not dare to speak up.
  However, now that Xin Ba had been defeated by Li Yu, they naturally did not have to tolerate it anymore. They would settle the new and old scores together.
 “W-what are you doing?” The Nine-Headed Lions roared.
     

 Faced with several times their number, they were naturally afraid.
 After all, the humans present were not weak, and some were from the Holy Lands. If they really attacked, they would be doomed.
 “Hmph, a life for a life! Your Young Master killed my junior brother. You shall atone for his sins!”
 “That’s right, a life for a life!”
 “Today, we will enforce justice on behalf of the heavens and eliminate you monsters!”
 The suppressed anger of the humans was vented as they unleashed their auras with killing intent.
 Someone attacked first, and it instantly ignited the battlefield.
 The humans immediately fought the Nine-Headed Lions.
 The sound of magic power colliding echoed instantly, shaking the grounds.
 There were many human experts. Although the Nine-Headed Lion race did have quite a few experts, it was still too difficult for two fists to fight four hands.
 Even if they had nine heads, they could not deal with the siege of nine human experts at once.
 Furthermore, apart from the few clan elders with the strongest cultivation who could grow nine heads, the others only had four to five heads at most, and it was not enough to deal with the human cultivators.
     

 Therefore, after only a short while of confrontation, more than half of the Nine-Headed Lions were dead or injured, and the rest were struggling to survive.
 Li Yu looked at the crowd below and did not interfere. After all, Xin Ba had killed many humans earlier and angered everyone.
 They were the ones who sought death. They could not blame anyone else. They could only blame Xin Ba for killing just now.
 Li Yu flew to the collapsed mountain peak alone and walked before Xin Ba’s enormous head.
 Compared to Xin Ba’s enormous head, Li Yu seemed tiny.
 “Hey, wake up!” Li Yu kicked Xin Ba’s head, causing it to sway.
 No matter what, Xin Ba was already a divine beast, Suan Ni. His body was firm, and his self-healing ability was remarkable.
 Although he had just taken a 30% hit from Li Yu and fainted, his injuries had essentially recovered. Hence, he seemed to have regained consciousness after a few kicks from Li Yu.
  He retracted his tongue, and his eyelids twitched.
 Soon, it slowly opened its eyes the size of Li Yu’s head.
 “You really can’t take a punch. Merely one punch, and you’re wasted!” Li Yu complained.
 Xin Ba’s eyes were disoriented at first, but he quickly returned to his senses and jumped up, attempting to run.
 Its enormous body was extremely agile and fast. It was as if it had teleported. In the blink of an eye, it was beyond a thousand kilometers away.
 I think I got rid of…
 However, before he could finish his sentence, a figure suddenly appeared behind him. After a step, Xin Ba’s body could not withstand Li Yu’s terrifying strength and knelt on the ground with a bang.
 “Are you sure you still want to escape? Be my mount obediently from now on!” Li Yu offered with a smile.
    
Chapter 170 Dao Seeking Tower Has a New Owner? (1)  On the Genius Excellence Rankings, Xin Ba, who had transformed into a Suan Ni, knelt on the ground under Li Yu’s foot and could not even stand up.
 At the same time, Li Yu’s voice sounded. “Are you sure you still want to escape? Be my mount obediently from now on!”
 At this point, Xin Ba’s Elegance Exhibition ended. The screen in the sky instantly disappeared.
 It left people with endless imagination!
 The world seemed to fall silent for a moment.
 However, countless people watching the rankings could not calm down for a long time.
 The human cultivators were excited and secretly satisfied.
  The demons were shrouded in gloom. They kept feeling that Li Yu was like a sharp blade hanging above their heads that struck fear into their hearts.
 Long Yue, who had transformed into a True Dragon, had been taken as Li Yu’s mount. Xin Ba, who had become a divine beast, was probably about to follow in Long Yue’s footsteps. Otherwise, he might not even be able to stay alive.
 on race  The two strongest prodigies of the demon race had actually fallen in the hands of Li Yu, and such matters were made known to the world by the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 They kept feeling that the Heavenly Dao seemed to be reminding them of something.
 “Your Majesty, our race…!” An elder of the Nine-Headed Lion race grieved.
 Although the Genius Excellence Rankings had ended, there was a silent massacre on the Demon Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 Those descendants of the Lion King who were on the same rankings as Xin Ba, along with the names of the other elites of the Nine-Headed Lion race.
     

 They had all turned gray, and the words ‘deceased’ were displayed at the back.
 Lion King Xin Teng closed his eyes in grief as he felt his heart bleed.
 Their Nine-Headed Lion race might die off without offspring! When he saw Xin Ba meet Li Yu, he had a bad feeling
 Xin Ba had previously killed a human cultivator. If he was defeated by Li Yu, the human race would definitely annihilate all their clansmen.
 Indeed, as he watched the young elites of the Nine-Headed Lion race die one by one on the Sons of Heaven Rankings, Lion King Xin Teng felt sharp blades stabbing into his heart.
 Although his favorite son, Xin Ba, was still alive. Xin Liu and Xin Shiyi, whom he doted on, were dead.
 It was a massive blow!
 At the moment, Young Master Qing Ye, who was in the hidden villa, looked at the disappearing scene in the sky with a complicated expression.
 “Young Master, Li Yu might ruin our grand
 plan!”
 A beautiful woman in a seven-colored immortal dress exclaimed.
 Qing Ye looked away and said nothing.
 “Should we do something to control the Qingyun Sect first?” the woman asked. “Master ordered that we can’t do anything to harm the Qingyun Sect!” Qing Ye said after a moment of silence.
 “Time should be enough. Our goal should be achieved before Li Yu comes out of the Lingtian Mystic Realm!” Qing Ye asserted.
 “Alright!” The woman nodded slightly.
 In the Lingtian Mystic Realm, the intense battle between the human cultivators and the Nine-Headed Lion race finally ended.
 The humans had killed half of the Nine-Headed Lions with lower cultivation levels at the price of a few injuries.
 The remaining ones who took the initiative to submit were all planted with slave seals. They were reduced to the mounts of the elders of the Holy Lands.
 After Xin Ba was taught a lesson by Li Yu, he finally submitted and followed in Long Yue’s footsteps.
     

 Although he was also unwilling, there was nothing he could do.
 He did not want to miserably die before he could touch the higher realm and become stronger, especially after becoming a divine beast.
 He wanted to wait for an opportunity to witness Li Yu’s death with his own eyes and wait for the day he could break free from Li Yu.
 Meanwhile. On the top floor of the Dao Seeking Tower.
 An elder sighed with a sympathetic expression. “Sigh, many have died. Why fight to the death!”
 “Boring! I thought they would kill every lion, but it’s over just like that. I’m so disappointed with this. I’m not in a good mood today. I’ll make sure to torture these guys later!” Another elder at the side scoffed coldly with a resentful expression.
 res  If anyone else was here, they would definitely be able to tell at a glance that the two elders looked almost identical.
 Except for their gazes and expressions, even the split hair strands were the same.
 They were the artifact spirits of the Dao Seeking Tower.
 In fact, the Dao Seeking Tower only had one artifact spirit originally. In the past, the Dao Seeking Tower used to be extremely lively.
 Every day, immortal disciples would enter to train and take on the challenges here. There was never a moment of silence.
 But ever since this Immortal Realm became a wasteland and was abandoned, the Dao Seeking Tower was left behind.
 The artifact spirit of the Dao Seeking Tower was already used to such a lively life.
  The artifact spirit could not withstand the sudden loneliness of countless years.
 Therefore, he cultivated himself to the point where he could split his personality! He had split into two different versions of himself.
 It was lively to quarrel with oneself every day. However, they would fall into a deep sleep every now and then, for some reason.
 The Dao Seeking Tower would either become hidden or closed.
 The Dao Seeking Tower only reopened after they woke up naturally.
 “You’re a wicked old man. Why must you make things difficult for these people? It’s not easy for them either!”
 “Hmph, this is the only way to hone their willpower and combat experience! On this topic, that human brat just now was pretty powerful. I have to pay more attention to him today!”
 “Don’t go overboard. It’s been a long time since we’ve encountered such a powerful guy. Maybe he can come to our level! I’m suddenly looking forward to it!”
    
Chapter 171 Dao Seeking Tower Has a New Owner? (2)  “Then we’ll see if he has the capability. Alright, there are enough people. They should be getting impatient. Let’s activate it!”
 Clang!
 Clang! Clang!
 Bell rings suddenly echoed from the Dao Seeking Tower.
 At the same time, circles of magic power fluctuations spread out, and the Dao Seeking Tower emitted a gentle halo.
 “The Dao Seeking Tower is about to open!” The crowd was buzzing as they looked in the direction of the Dao Seeking Tower with eager expressions.
 The two artifact spirits in the Dao Seeking Tower looked at the expressions of the people outside and revealed different smiles.
  “I like their expectant and urgent expressions! It’ll be fun today!”
 “Haha, our Dao Seeking Tower can be lively for a long while again!”
 “Alright, it’s time for us to get down to business!” The two artifact spirits retracted their senses from the outside and opened the door of the Dao Seeking Tower.
 Everyone was excited to see the Dao Seeking Tower’s door open and was about to enter to begin the training.
 Li Yu rode Xin Ba on his return from afar and landed in front of the Dao Seeking Tower. Upon Li Yu’s return, everyone’s gaze instantly shifted from the Dao Seeking Tower to Li Yu.
 Immediately, they surrounded him like stars surrounding the moon.
 Previously, they would probably only praise Li Yu in their hearts since Li Yu was on top of the Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 However, they had just witnessed Li Yu’s god-like strength.
 After confirming from the people from the Clear Void Holy Land and the Jade Pure Dao Sect that Li Yu was the person who had spoken the mantras of the Great Dao, Those from the various Holy Lands, sects, dynasties and aristocratic families not only admired and respected him from their hearts, they even wanted to worship Li Yu.
 Li Yu was no doubt the number one expert of the human race!
 Furthermore, he was so young, and his future was limitless.
 It was not easy to have the fortune to meet such a godly figure.
 How could they not try to befriend him? It was good enough to become acquainted.
 For a period, Li Yu was more attractive than the Dao Seeking Tower.
 “I’m Elder Tian Xingzi of the Primordial Dao Holy Land. Greetings, Young Friend Li Yu. I’ve heard your name for a while. It is truly my pleasure meeting you today!”
 “I’m Elder Xuan Xiaozi of the Divine Firmament Holy Land. Greetings, Young Friend Li Yu!”
 “I’m Elder…
 The elders of the various Holy Lands, sects and aristocratic families greeted Li Yu on behalf of their families.
 “I’m Chu Yunhe from the Primordial Dao Holy Land. Greetings, Immortal Master!” Chu Yunhe walked in front of Li Yu and kowtowed.
 His action shocked everyone.
 They immediately sighed as they understood Chu Yunhe’s move was too clever!
 As expected of the Holy Son of the Primordial Dao Holy Land, his mind is brilliant, and his words are distinctive.
 He addressed Li Yu as Immortal Master.
 The name sounded high-class.
 This form of address instantly stood out, and it probably made Li Yu remember him.
 Bravo!
 I’m impressed!
 “Thanks to the teachings of Immortal Master’s Great Dao mantras, I, Yun He, was fortunate enough to comprehend deeper into the Great Dao. It helped my cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds! It’s a pity that Yun He never knew who Immortal Master was. Now that I’m finally fortunate enough to meet you, Yun He can finally express his gratitude and respect to you in person!”
 Chu Yunhe continued with a sincere expression.
 His words enlightened everyone.
 Many people had heard about Chu Yunhe breaking through to the Tribulation realm directly after hearing the mantra of the Great Dao at the Prodigy Convention.
 In that case, it was only natural for Chu Yunhe to address him as an immortal master.
 After Chu Yunhe started this form of address, the various elites followed to call Li Yu immortal master.
 They also expressed how the teachings and enlightenment of Li Yu’s Great Dao mantras had benefited them.
 At the moment, the Dao Seeking Tower seemed like a large-scale teacher-honoring venue.
 Meanwhile, in the Dao Seeking Tower. The artifact spirits, who had already set up new checkpoints for the various levels, were dumbfounded. “What’s going on? What are these guys doing? The door is already open. Why aren’t they coming in?” After a long while, the young elites of the various families began entering the Dao Seeking Tower to commence their challenge.
 Meanwhile, in the Dao Seeking Tower. The artifact spirits, who had already set up new checkpoints for the various levels, were dumbfounded. “What’s going on? What are these guys doing? The door is already open. Why aren’t they coming in?” After a long while, the young elites of the various families began entering the Dao Seeking Tower to commence their challenge.
 As the cultivators streamed into the Dao Seeking Tower, names began to surface on the stone tablet beside the door.
 “Master, what’s the use of that stone tablet?” a young cultivator asked his master curiously.
  “In a while, it will be like the Heavenly Dao Rankings, displaying the rankings of the challengers and the final level they stopped at!” an old man explained.
 “Oh, Master, how many floors does this Dao Seeking Tower have?”
 “I’m not sure either. As of now, the fifth floor seemed to be the maximum for those who had entered! However, this Dao Seeking Tower definitely has more than five floors! Alright, you should enter too. Let yourself loose and fight. Enjoy battles that surpass the limit of life and death to your heart’s content. You won’t really die inside! This is a rare opportunity to gain experience!”
 “Yes, Master!” The young cultivator cupped his hands and followed those in front into the Dao Seeking Tower.
 Soon, all the young human cultivators entered the Dao Seeking Tower and began their respective challenges.
 The space in the Dao Seeking Tower was unique. Everyone would be in an independent room with no other challengers around. Everyone fought and cleared the levels in their own spaces without interfering with each other.
 The order of the names on the tall stone tablet at the entrance of the Dao Seeking Tower rapidly changed.
 The elders of the various Holy Lands, sects, and families waiting outside surrounded the stone tablet to observe the results and rankings of their disciples.
Chapter 172 Dao Seeking Tower Has a New Owner? (3)  In addition, everyone was paying attention to another name— Li Yu.
 “Li Yu reached the fifth level so soon!”
 “With his ability, the first few floors are surely not difficult!”
 “I guess we’ll be fortunate enough to witness the clearing of every floor of this Dao Seeking Tower today!”
 “Hmm, Li Yu might really have the ability to reach the top. I wonder how many levels there are exactly?” Everyone was looking forward to it.
 Over the years, the best of geniuses who had entered this place had only at most reached the fifth level, so no one knew how many floors there were in the Dao Seeking Tower.
 As everyone spoke, Li Yu had already arrived at the seventh level.
  In the Dao Seeking Tower. When Li Yu reached the seventh floor, he realized that it seemed to be the peak of a mountain.
 An immortal-like person with fluttering clothes stood with his hands behind his back on the mountain peak.
     

 Seeing Li Yu appear, the immortal’s gaze was indifferent as he said calmly, “It’s been a long time since anyone came…
 Blast!
 Before the immortal could finish his sentence, he was punched into smoke by Li Yu and dissipated.
 “Still too weak! Boring!” Li Yu withdrew his fist and remarked with a bored expression.
 He suddenly understood One Punch Man’s distress.
 When nothing could withstand a punch from him, every fight felt the same. He would no longer feel any sense of accomplishment or the thrill of victory.
 It was a dull feeling.
 Boom!
 The surroundings spun as space shifted, and Li Yu’s figure appeared in a brand new location…
 “This little kid is so outstanding. We’ve waited for countless years, and there is finally hope!”
 The artifact spirit at the top floor exclaimed excitedly. “Where is the limit of this guy’s power level? That was a phantom comparable to the peak of the Perfected Immortal realm. He was also defeated with a single punch!”
 “Young man, keep it up. Hurry up and defeat us, and you can have us!”
 “Another punch. The phantom on the eighth level lost too!”
     

 “Hahaha, here we go! Someone is finally here on the ninth floor!”
 Outside the Dao Seeking Tower, everyone witnessed Li Yu passing through the levels in a few breaths to arrive at the ninth level in the blink of an eye.
 Everyone was shocked again. According to previous challenges, the fifth level was roughly equivalent to the peak of the Mahayana Realm. In that case, Li Yu’s strength was at least three to four major realms above the Mahayana Realm.
 He was at least a Perfected Immortal or even a Golden Immortal. He could be considered an absolute expert in the Immortal Domain.
 More importantly, he was too young. If he were a hundred years old, perhaps no one would be that shocked.
 At that moment, on the ninth floor of the Dao Seeking Tower. Li Yu looked at the two elders, who looked identical but had different expressions.
 One was smiling slyly, while the other face seemed capable of killing. There’s actually a twin on the ninth level?
 The old man with the despicable smile suddenly spoke, “Little child, I’ve finally waited for you. It’s been a long time. It’s been so long since anyone came to our floor. It’s been so long that I almost forgot who I am…
  Swoosh!
 Before the artifact spirit could finish its sentence, it was slashed into a wisp of smoke by Li Yu. Rumble!
 At this moment, the realm shook. Golden light manifested from the surrounding void and instantly entered Li Yu’s body.
 Immediately, it transformed into many pieces of information that fused into Li Yu’s mind. It was the description of the Dao Seeking Tower’s usage.
 “Young man, congratulations on successfully passing the test of the ninth level after countless difficulties and obtaining the recognition of the Dao Seeking Tower. From now on, you are the master of this Dao Seeking Tower!” An ethereal voice echoed in Li Yu’s mind.
 Li Yu smiled. He was still thinking about how he could transport the Dao Seeking Tower back. He did not expect the Dao Seeking Tower to automatically recognize him as its master after he had cleared the ninth level.
 It was way simpler than he had imagined.
 Compared to the boredom of clearing the level and fighting, the joy of obtaining the Dao Seeking Tower was not too bad.
    
Chapter 173 Bloodline and Physique Rankings (1)  Outside the Dao Seeking Tower. Li Yu’s name suddenly disappeared from the stone tablet, causing an uproar. “What’s going on? Did Li Yu fail on the ninth level?”
 “That’s not right. Even if one fails, the name shouldn’t disappear!”
 As everyone was wondering, the names on the stone tablet disappeared one after another.
 At the same time, the Dao Seeking Tower began to tremble slightly, creating circles of energy ripples.
 Soon after, the young cultivators who had entered the Dao Seeking Tower not long ago flew out of the door.
 “What’s going on? What happened?” The elders hurriedly pulled their disciples over and asked.
 “The Dao Seeking Tower has just announced the end of the challenge. Everyone must leave immediately!”
  “Why did it end so suddenly? What happened?” Everyone was puzzled.
 At that moment, a line of words suddenly appeared on the stone tablet beside the Dao Seeking Tower.
 (Li Yu has completed all the challenges in the Dao Seeking Tower. Reward: Dao Seeking Tower]
 Reward? Dao Seeking Tower?
 Huh?
 The Dao Seeking Tower gave itself to Li Yu as a reward?
 Everyone was in an uproar when they saw this line of words.
     

 Everyone knew that the Dao Seeking Tower gave out various rewards to challengers.
 However, no one expected the Dao Seeking Tower could do such a thing, to treat itself as a reward for Li Yu.
 This meant the Dao Seeking Tower had recognized Li Yu as its master and became his personal item.
 While everyone was in a commotion, the Dao Seeking Tower suddenly began shrinking.
 In the end, it turned into a small tower that landed in Li Yu’s palm.
 Everyone had complicated expressions when they saw this.
 The Dao Seeking Tower had been in the Pivot Domain for countless years.
 It had become a landmark here. Every time the Lingtian Mystic Realm opened, the young would continue to visit this place.
 Now, the landmark building was taken by Li Yu just like that.
 It made everyone feel a sudden emptiness.
 Li Yu held the miniature Dao Seeking Tower like he was Li Jing, the Heavenly King carrying the pagoda. “Congratulations, Immortal Master, for obtaining the Dao Seeking Tower!”
 “Immortal Master is indeed blessed with extraordinary luck and strength. He actually made this Dao Seeking Tower acknowledge him as its master!”
  “Congratulations, Immortal Master!” Although the surrounding people were slightly disappointed, they did not forget to take the opportunity to flatter Li Yu.
 Li Yu smiled and responded, “My apologies. I didn’t expect to acquire the Dao Seeking Tower’s recognition after completing the challenge on the ninth floor. Don’t worry, everyone. In the future, I’ll place the Dao Seeking Tower in our Qingyun Sect and open it to the public. If any of the disciples want to come and train, you’re welcome at any time!”
 Despite saying that, Li Yu was already calculating the charging standard for the Dao Seeking Tower.
 Hearing Li Yu’s words, everyone’s disappointment instantly vanished into thin air, and they were thrilled.
 If Li Yu brought the Dao Seeking Tower back and opened it for everyone, wouldn’t they be able to enter the Dao Seeking Tower to train at any time in the future?
 With this in mind, it was good news that Li Yu had obtained the Dao Seeking Tower’s recognition.
     

 The Forsaken Immortal Realm, one of the Nine Heavens Immortal Realms. The Primordial Dao Immortal Sect.
 This was the origin of the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 As for the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect. It had countless Holy Land branches in the three thousand worlds of the lower realm, but they belonged to the same lineage.
 The current Deputy Hall Master of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect’s Hall of Justice was once a Holy Lord of the Immortal Martial World’s Primordial Dao Holy Land who had ascended to this Immortal Realm.
 In the eyes of those in the Forsaken Immortal Realm, the Immortal Martial World was also called the Jingxing Realm.
 “What are your thoughts on our Primordial Dao Holy Land in the Jingxing Realm?” In the immortal sect, the elders in charge of the affairs of the branches of the lower realm were gathered to discuss the Primordial Dao Holy Land
 “Right now, we can’t confirm what happened in the Jingxing Realm. I suggest sending a few disciples to the lower realm to investigate and confirm what happened and who the enemy is before we determine the next move!”
 “Hmm, alright. I’ll get the deputy hall master of the Hall of Justice, Yan Zi, to bring a few disciples to the lower realm to investigate. He’s from the Primordial Dao Holy Land in the Jingxing Realm and is more familiar with that place. His cultivation is at the Upper Immortal Realm. It’s best to have him take on this mission!”
 “Alright, I’ll inform Yan Zi!”
 On Zi Qing Peak of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect, after learning that something had happened to the Primordial Dao Holy Land, Dao Yanzi was anxious.
 He had ascended to this Immortal Realm and left the Jingxing Realm for more than ten thousand years.
 However, that was once his home, after all. As the former Holy Lord, the Primordial Dao Holy Land bore significant meaning and feelings in his heart.
 “Junior Brother Dao Yan, let Yu Fan and Yu Chen follow you to the lower realm!” said Lu Fanchen, the Master of Ziqing Peak and the Hall of Justice.
  He had a good relationship with Dao Yanzi, even though Dao Yanzi was over ten thousand years older than Lu Fanchen.
 Furthermore, one was born and raised in the Forsaken Immortal Realm, while the other had ascended from the lower realm.
 However, the two were like-minded and became good friends despite their age difference.
 Therefore, when he heard that something had happened to the Primordial Dao Holy Land, Lu Fanchen immediately brought his two sons over and requested them to follow Dao Yanzi to the lower realm.
 Lu Yufan and Lu Yuchen were both the cream of the crop among the younger generation of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect. They were already in the Upper Immortal Realm.
 “Senior Brother, I appreciate your kindness. I don’t know what happened in the Jingxing Realm, so it’s better not to put your two nephews in danger!” Dao Yanzi said solemnly.
 “It’s fine. I’m letting the two follow you to gain experience!” Lu Fanchen was not bothered by Dao Yanzi’s concern.
 “That’s right, Uncle-Master. Let us follow you. We’re not afraid of danger. We do need more experience!” Lu Yufan asserted, his eyes flashed with anticipation.
    
Chapter 174 Bloodline and Physique Rankings (2)  Lu Yufan had never been to the lower realm.
 Although it was said that the lower realm was far inferior to the Immortal Realm, as long as there was no father or master, it was his heaven. “Just let the children follow. Having more people will give you more help! Besides, if there’s really any danger, we still have you!” Lu Fanchen assured.
 Although Dao Yanzi was also in the Upper Immortal Realm, he had long reached the peak of the Upper Immortal Realm and was half a step into the Perfected Immortal Realm.
 In terms of comprehension of the Great Dao and Dao attainments, it was definitely not something these two young juniors who had just entered the Upper Immortal Realm could compare with.
 Furthermore, Dao Yanzi had cultivated for tens of thousands of years. His solid foundation was not something those immortals in the Immortal Realm, blessed by the heavens and piled up with various resources, could compare themselves with.
 “Then I’ll have to trouble the two of you to follow me to the lower realm!”
 “Not at all, not at all! Uncle-Master Dao Yan’s matters are our matters!” Lu Yufan grinned.
  He thought to himself that he could finally go out and have fun. He could finally escape from his father and master’s control!
 He could not wait to set off. He was simply too excited.
 At that moment, the power of heaven and earth suddenly fluctuated, and profound echoes sounded in the sky.
 Dao Yanzi, Lu Fanchen, Lu Yufan, and Lu Yuchen looked into the sky together.
 Two new rankings appeared on the Heavenly Dao Rankings: the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings and the Heavenly Physique Rankings.
 At the same time, a row of golden words appeared below, annotating the rankings.
 [This ranking only includes the best physique and bloodline in the universe.]
     

 [Each ranking would only select the top 50.]
 [After a month, the names of the corresponding physiques and bloodline owners will be announced while rewards are given.]
 Dao Yanzi, Lu Fanchen, and the others were no longer surprised by the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 A month ago, the Immortal Realm’s Heavenly Dao Rankings appeared and announced the rankings of the prodigies of the Forsaken Immortal Realm.
 Therefore, they were not too surprised to see the new rankings.
 However, they were somewhat interested.
 The Heavenly Bloodline Rankings? The Heavenly Physique Rankings?
 Interesting!
 There were three thousand Great Dao in the universe and many extraordinary physiques and bloodlines.
 Not many in the Immortal Realm dared to say that they knew all the special physiques and bloodlines.
 No one could comprehensively determine the strength of these physiques and bloodlines.
  Even though the various large factions in the Immortal Realm had once ranked the known special physiques in the world, such rankings were ultimately one-sided and subjective.
 Therefore, they wanted to see what the bloodline and physique rankings announced by the Heavenly Dao were like.
 “There are 3000 kinds of physiques in the universe, but only the top 50 owners are shown. It looks difficult to get on the rankings!” Lu Fanchen sighed.
 “Dad, your Great Expanse Dao Body will definitely be on the rankings!” Lu Yufan smiled.
 “Dad will definitely be fine. Second Brother, your Divine Thunder Dao Body should be on the rankings too!” Lu Yuchen chipped in.
 “It’s a little difficult,” Lu Fanchen shook his head. “If it’s exclusively our Forsaken Immortal Realm’s ranking. We can definitely get on it. However, it’s hard to say for getting into the universe ranking!” Just as Lu Fanchen and his sons were chatting.
     

 The first name on the Heavenly Dao Rankings was announced. Physique Rankings # 50: Great Expanse Dao Body
 “Haha, this is great! Dad, your physique is really on the rankings!” Lu Yufan cheered excitedly.
 Delight surfaced on Lu Fanchen’s face. He did not expect his physique to be on the rankings.
 According to the explanation of the Heavenly Dao Rankings, all those with physiques on the rankings should be rewarded. He could also obtain the Heavenly Dao’s reward this time.
 At the same time, Kong Jia, the divine son’s servant of the Gongshu family, one of the five top ancient families of the Forsaken Immortal Realm, was equally delighted.
 “Kong Jia, I remember that you have the Great Expanse Dao Body.”
 On the Immortal Platform. A handsome young man with peerless looks stood proudly. He looked at the Heavenly Physique Rankings in the sky calmly and spoke to his servant.
 “My lord, I do have the Great Expanse Dao Body!” Kong Jia bowed and cupped his hands. Then, he hurriedly said, “The top spot on the Heavenly Physique Rankings this time will definitely be my lord’s Chaos Divine Body!”
 This young man was the current Divine Son of the Gongshu family, ranked first on the Forsaken Immortal Realm’s Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 He was also one of the most dazzling star prodigies in the Immortal Realm, Gongshu Qitian.
 Gongshu Qitian’s expression remained calm as he looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings with no response.
 It was not that he was old-fashioned or modest.
  Since he believed what Kong Jia said was the undisputed truth, he was naturally calm.
 At the moment, the entire Gongshu family’s immortal estate was bustling with noise and excitement.
 The young disciples of the Gongshu family were discussing the new rankings.
 They believed that the divine son’s Chaos Divine Body was the strongest physique in the universe.
 Therefore, they were looking forward to the moment his Chaos Divine Body reached the top of the rankings.
 Of course, among the young disciples of the Gongshu family, besides Gongshu Qitian, there were also many peerless geniuses whose names shook the Immortal Realm.
 For example, the ten sequences of the Gongshu family basically possessed special physiques and powerful bloodlines. Their physiques and bloodlines also had a chance of entering the rankings. In addition, there were many people with terrifying physiques and bloodlines in the older generation of the Gongshu family.
 Physique Rankings # 48: Misfortune Dao Body
    
Chapter 175 Bloodline and Physique Rankings (3)  Physique Rankings # 47: Divine Thunder Dao Body
 Physique Rankings # 46: Taiyin Dao Body
 Physique Rankings # 45: Life Spirit Dao Body
 Physique Rankings # 44: Taiyang Dao Body “Haha, Big Brother, our physiques are on the rankings! Your Taiyang Dao Body is actually ranked 44. Impressive!” Lu Yufan cheered. “I wonder how the Heavenly Dao Rankings measure the strength of one’s physique. Logically speaking, my physique should be ranked behind Second Brother!” Lu Yuchen pondered.
 The Divine Thunder Dao Body was indeed stronger in terms of combat power.
 Furthermore, the Divine Thunder Dao Body was publicly acknowledged as stronger than the Taiyang Dao Body in the Immortal Realm.
 “Yes, in terms of combat strength, the Divine Thunder Dao Body is powerful. But, the Heavenly Dao Rankings might not only evaluate one’s physique based on combat strength. It must also involve comprehensive calculations in other aspects! For example, your Taiyang Dao Body can suppress evil spirits and ghosts. The Divine Thunder Dao Body can’t compare with it in terms of purification and nurturing the soul!” Lu Fanchen explained. “Alright, you two brothers should hurry up and prepare. Prepare to follow your uncle-master to the lower realm later! Before you leave, don’t forget to bid farewell to your mother!” Lu Fanchen added.
  “Don’t worry, Dad. I’ll say goodbye to my mother!” Lu Yufan said with a smile.
     

 “Okay, go ahead!”
 The two brothers left Dao Yanzi’s residence together. Lu Yuchen suddenly said, “Second Brother, I’ll bid farewell to my master first before going to mother’s place!”
 Lu Yuchen and Lu Yufan were not biological brothers. To be precise, Lu Yuchen was a child Lu Fanchen picked up. That year, Lu Yufan was just born, and the two were five years apart.
 Lu Fanchen treated him like his own son, and he was no different from younger brother Lu Yufan and younger sister Lu Li.
 Their mother treated him very well, but there was still a biological difference.
 He believed they could never be as intimate as biological children.
 Therefore, to avoid awkwardness, he did not want to bid farewell to his mother together with Lu Yufan so that his mother could speak to Lu Yufan alone.
 “Okay!” Lu Yufan did not think much about it and flew straight to his mother’s residence.
 Under the ancient tree in the courtyard, a young girl sat by a jade table, munching on immortal fruits while swinging her feet.
 She was Lu Yufan’s younger sister, Lu Li.
 Seeing Lu Yufan fly over, Lu Li asked casually, “I heard you’re going to the lower realm with Uncle-Master Dao Yan?”
 Lu Yufan was slightly displeased to hear Lu Li speak to him so rudely without calling him brother.
     

 His younger sister always gave him a headache. She had been spoiled by her parents from the day she was born and was always rude to him.
 Most importantly, he could not beat or scold her.
 It was infuriating!
 His sister Lu Li seemed to have some unknown bloodline.
 Her power level was ridiculous. Although she was only in the Immortal Spirit Realm, it was not difficult for her to defeat him even though he was at a higher level!
 “Gasp… You brat, why are you still so rude? How many times do I have to tell you that adding a title before talking to me is basic courtesy!” Lu Yufan snapped.
 Lu Li glanced at Lu Yufan expressionlessly and responded, “Title? I heard that you’re going to the lower realm with Uncle-Master Dao Yan?”
  Lu Yufan was speechless.
 “I can’t be bothered with you!” Lu Yufan did not answer and walked into the room.
 Lu Li snorted and took a big bite of the fruit. Then, she followed Lu Yufan into the room and closed the door.
 The moment the door closed, a talisman was pasted to it.
 At the same time, an invisible light screen instantly enveloped the entire house.
 After a moment, the door opened again. The talisman transformed into a stream of light that flew into the room. Afterward, Lu Yufan walked out while biting a fruit in his mouth and the unconscious Lu Yufan on his shoulder.
 Then, he walked into Lu Li’s room and placed the unconscious Lu Yufan in it.
 “Second Brother, stay at home and accompany Dad! Big Brother and I are going to the lower realm to play!” The Lu Yufan with the fruit laughed.
    
Chapter 176 Forsaken Immortal Realm Wrecked by a Human Body (1)  The appearance of the Heavenly Physique Rankings and the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings attracted the attention of the various factions in the entire Forsaken Immortal Realm.
 Other than ordinary sects like the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect. The top five families—are the Gongshu family, Qin family, Mo family, Ye family, and Situ family. And the Dragon King Hall, Sun God Mountain, Phoenix Ancient Cave, and other ancient royal families.
 Swen  Many top factions were also paying attention to these two rankings.
 Everyone wanted to see what the 50 best special physiques and bloodlines in the universe were.
 What kind of ranking could their own family’s physique and bloodline rank?
 The Qin family was an ancient powerhouse. Today was the Qin family’s ceremony to confer the title of the Divine Son. The entire 19 cities of the Qin Clan were celebrating.
  The scene in the Qin family’s Heavenly Star Palace was unprecedented.
 The various sects and factions controlled by the Qin family, and those aristocratic families with close ties to the Qin family, were all present to participate in this grand ceremony.
 Even the head of the Situ family, Situ Nan, led his elders and young elites to participate.
 The Gongshu family and the Ye family also sent their representatives to congratulate.
 The new son of the Qin family-Qin Fengwas the fifth son of the Qin family’s master.
 He was only 20 years old, but he was already in the Golden Immortal realm. He was also ranked third on the previous Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 Actually, Qin Feng was already quite famous before he was born. On the day of his birth, his name became well-known.
 It was said that his mother was pregnant for eighteen years before giving birth to him.
     

 Der  Furthermore, on the day of delivery, there was a natural phenomenon. Auspicious signs filled the air, and the sound of the Great Dao resounded through the world. Numerous godly phantoms were present in the sky.
 Many people felt that Qin Feng must be born to be different.
 Perhaps only a reincarnated God-King or someone with a special physique and bloodline could cause such a phenomenon.
 Furthermore, although Qin Feng was only ranked third on the Sons of Heaven Rankings, he was only 20 years old.
 While the first place, Gongshu Qitian, and the second place, Dragon King Hall’s number one prodigy, Ao Ying, were over a hundred years old.
 Therefore, many knew that Qin Feng had tremendous potential.
 He might even surpass Gongshu Qitian and Ao Ying in the future.
 Of course, many were curious about Qin Feng’s powerful physique and bloodline.
 Physique Rankings # 19: Earth Saint Body
 Physique Rankings # 18: Stellar Saint Body
 Physique Rankings # 17: Emperor Flame Saint Body
 Physique Rankings # 16: Heavenly Dragon Saint Body
  “It’s announced up to the 16th place. I’ve never heard of most physiques on the rankings. I wonder what kind of physique our Divine Son has?”
 “Our Divine Son’s special physique is definitely in the top five. It might even be stronger than Gongshu Qitian’s physique!”
 “Yeah, his physique is definitely number one!”
 “That’s right. Since the Divine Son is so extraordinary, the physique he possesses must be extraordinary as well. The rankings will give us the answer this time!”
 “It’s a pity that the owners of the various physiques will only be announced in a month. It’s really whetting my appetite!”
 “True, but I’m also looking forward to it!”
     

 Many Qin Family disciples discussed as they observed the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 The Divine Son they mentioned, Qin Feng, was currently standing on the high platform in the center of attention. He had a breathtaking extraordinary immortal-like appearance.
 He had just completed the appointment ceremony for the Divine Son and was staring at the Heavenly Dao Rankings in the sky.
 The appearance of the Heavenly Physique and Bloodline Rankings had brought about a small interlude in today’s appointment ceremony.
 However, Qin Feng was thrilled because he always wanted to know what kind of physique and bloodline he possessed.
 Clearly, the Heavenly Dao Rankings could give him an answer.
 He had heard of numerous names of physiques on the rankings, but many were never heard of.
 Like the Emperor Flame Saint Body, the Heavenly Dragon Saint Body, and others.
 However, he could roughly eliminate some of them through the physique name. Furthermore, he was confident that his physique should be among the top.
 “Qin Feng’s future is limitless. In the Forsaken Immortal Realm, only Qin Feng can compete with Gongshu Qitian!” Situ Nan smiled and congratulated Qin Feng’s father, Qin Jingyun.
 “Brother Situ, you flatter me. Your daughter doesn’t lose to Feng’er either. Oh yes. If I remember correctly, Shuiyue has a Connate Saint Body, right?” Qin Jingyun asked with a smile.
 The Situ family’s power and foundation were on par with the Qin family as an ancient family.
 Situ Nan’s daughter, Situ Shuiyue, was also a peerless prodigy.
 Ranked fifth on the Sons of Heaven Rankings, her power level was similarly extraordinary.
 Despite that, the competition between the elites was often only a hair’s breadth away. If they really fought, it was still unknown who was better.
  After all, there were many external factors that determined the performance of a battle.
 Hence, even if Situ Shuiyue was ranked fifth, it did not mean that she was weaker than Qin
 Feng.
 Furthermore, she had perfectly inherited her parents’ strengths. She had even surpassed her parents in capability and beauty.
 She was definitely a renowned beauty in the entire Forsaken Immortal Realm, the goddess in the hearts of many young men in the realm.
 “Indeed, my daughter has the Connate Saint Body! My daughter is too competitive. After the announcement of the Sons of Heaven Rankings, she was not satisfied with her ranking and had been in seclusion during this period. Otherwise, I would have brought her to participate in this grand ceremony today!” Situ Nan smiled.
 In fact, he fancied Qin Feng a lot and even wanted to matchmake the two children.
 Although Situ Shuiyue was ten years older than Qin Feng, immortals had particularly long lifespans. Compared to their lifespan, ten years was an insignificant age difference.
    
Chapter 177 Forsaken Immortal Realm Wrecked by a Human Body (2)  Moreover, Qin Feng had been in his mother’s womb for 18 years.
 If the past 18 years were included, Qin Feng was actually older than Situ Shuiyue.
 “Haha, as expected of your daughter. She inherited your temper from back then!” Qin Jingyun laughed.
 As the two of them chatted, the Physique Rankings had already been announced to 10th place.
 Physique Rankings # 10: Connate Saint Body
 “This… Connate Saint Body is only ranked tenth?” Qin Jingyun was quite surprised.
 He was actually surprised.
  They had knowledge of those top-notch special physiques. In their opinion, even if they conservatively estimated that this Connate Saint Body was not in the top five, it should at least be in the seventh or eighth place.
 “This is the Heavenly Physique Rankings. There should be many powerful physiques that we have never heard of!” Although Situ Nan was a little disappointed, he could understand.
 After all, there was always someone better. The Forsaken Immortal Realm was only one of the nine immortal realms.
 Furthermore, apart from the Immortal Realm, there were also those unknown forbidden areas, mysterious worlds hidden in the chaos, and worlds opened up by powerful Saint Lords and Supremacies.
 It was possible to create unbelievable special physiques and living beings.
 Physique Rankings # 9: Void Divine Body
 Physique Rankings # 8: Firmament Tyrant Body
     

 “The Firmament Tyrant Body? This is the powerful physique cultivated by the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor, right?” Qin Jingyun asked.
 Although he had heard of the Firmament Tyrant Body, it only existed in legends.
 This physique was known only because of the reputation of the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor.
 It was said that this was a physique exclusive to the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor.
 As for the legend of the Firmament Tyrant Body, it was gradually drowned in the river of time with the disappearance of the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor.
 If not for this day’s Heavenly Dao Rankings, many people would have probably forgotten about this special physique.
 “Hmm, to be ranked ahead of the Connate Saint Body and the Void Divine Body, this physique seems as powerful as the legends say!” Situ Nan sighed.
 “For the Firmament Tyrant Body to be on the rankings, could it be that the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor did not die?” Qin Jingyun pondered.
 “Hmm, that’s possible. We will have to wait a month for the answer to be revealed!” Situ Nan seemed a little excited.
 As the Heavenly Dao Rankings began to announce the top ten physiques, the attractiveness of the rankings skyrocketed.
 After all, everyone wanted to see what the top ten physiques in the universe were.
 Physique Rankings # 7: Desolate Saint Body
  Physique Rankings # 6: Eternal Divine Body
 Physique Rankings # 5: Primordial Divine Body
 “The Desolate Saint Body is indeed the strongest among saint bodies. It’s actually ranked higher than the Void Divine Body and the Firmament Tyrant Body!”
 “It’s a pity that it’s been a long time since such a powerful physique has appeared in our Forsaken Immortal Realm. I wonder which Immortal Realm’s expert this Desolate Saint Body belongs to?”
 “Eternal Divine Body? Primordial Divine Body? I’ve never heard of these two physiques! But the names sound extraordinary!”
 “The top six should be divine bodies now!”
     

 “The Divine Son of the Gongshu family might really have the strongest physique in the universe!”
 “Hmm, that’s possible! The Chaos Divine Body is the physique possessed by our Forsaken Immortal Realm’s Immortal Emperor Zong Tian. Anyway, I’ve never heard of anyone stronger than this physique!”
 Countless people from the Forsaken Immortal Realm discussed as they held their breaths and focused on the Heavenly Dao Rankings, waiting for the top five to be announced.
 “Brother Qin, it seems like your son’s physique is among the remaining few!” Situ Nan smiled and commented.
 Qin Jingyun stroked his beard and replied, “It’s hard to say. Perhaps Feng’er has an Eternal or Primordial Divine Body!”
 Despite saying that, Qin Jingyun was also looking forward to it. He even had a feeling that his son’s physique should be in the top three.
 It should be only inferior to the Chaos Divine Body or even surpass it.
 Qin Feng was also looking at the Heavenly Dao Rankings with anticipation. He even felt inexplicably nervous. He had taken a closer look at the Eternal Divine Body and the Primordial Divine Body.
 Although he had never heard of these two physiques, his intuition told him they were not his.
 Therefore, he was also looking forward to the top four physiques and whether they would fit his own.
 Physique Rankings # 4: Phoenix Overlord Body
 Physique Rankings # 3: Grand Ancestral Divine Body
 “Phoenix Overlord Body, Grand Ancestral Divine Body. Another two physiques I’ve never heard of!” Situ Nan frowned as he pondered.
  He could roughly guess that it was the physique of a certain old phoenix in the Phoenix Ancient Cave.
 Meanwhile, the Grand Ancestral Divine Body seemed to be related to the Ancestral Demon.
 This piqued his interest.
 “It’s probably some kind of powerful physique of the Ancestral Demon! Interesting. We’ve heard of other Ancestral Demon bloodlines before, but this is the first time we’ve heard of this one! I wonder who this owner is!” Qin Jingyun remarked.
 “Yeah. Eh, could this physique be Qin Feng’s physique? On the day he was born, those god phantoms surfaced in the sky. Perhaps they’re the legendary Ancestral Demons!” Situ Nan gave his opinion.
 However, Qin Jingyun shook his head. “I don’t think so. I have a trace of the Ancestral Demon bloodline. If it really appeared that day, I should have sensed it!”
 “Then the answer lies in the remaining two!” said Situ Nan.
 Standing on the high platform. Qin Feng’s pupils were slightly constricted as he clenched his fists involuntarily. He also felt that one of the top two might belong to him.
    
Chapter 178 Forsaken Immortal Realm Wrecked by a Human Body (3)  The other should be Gongshu Qitian’s Chaos Divine Body.
 At the moment, everyone from the Gongshu family was focused on the Heavenly Physique Rankings.
 “There are only the top two left. The Divine Son’s Chaos Divine Body must be number
 one!”
 “Haha, that’s right. The Chaos Divine Body is definitely the strongest physique now!” The Gongshu family was filled with anticipation. As for the Gongshu family’s master, Gongshu Jin, he was also smiling. According to the current situation, there was a high chance that the Chaos Divine Body would be number one.
 CU
 ce   At least in the long river of time, they had never heard of a physique that could surpass the Chaos Divine Body.
 Gongshu Qitian was still expressionless, and his gaze was peaceful.
     

 He believed that his Chaos Divine Body would become the first.
 He was curious about the second place’s physique.
 In any case, the top physiques he knew were already on the rankings. The second place should be a new physique.
 It was worth his attention.
 At this moment, the second-ranked physique was announced on the Physique Rankings.
 Physique Rankings # 2: Chaos Divine Body “Gasp!”
 The entire Gongshu family’s cities and the Heavenly Imperial Palace were stunned.
 “The Divine Son’s Chaos Divine Body is only ranked second!”
 “How is this possible? There is a physique stronger than the Chaos Divine Body!”
 “There’s actually a physique stronger than our Divine Son’s? I must see what kind of physique it is!”
 The members of the Gongshu family were shocked and disappointed.
 As for Gongshu Jin and the elders of the Gongshu family, they frowned and eyed each other, unable to believe what they had just witnessed.
 On the other hand, Gongshu Qitian only frowned slightly. The disappointment in his eyes quickly disappeared before he calmed down again.
 Then, his pupils constricted as he stared at the spot where the top spot was about to appear.
     

 He wanted to see what kind of physique was above his Chaos Divine Body and rank top.
 At the moment, it was not only the Gongshu family. In fact, countless families and factions in the Forsaken Immortal Realm were more or less surprised at the outcome.
 After all, the Chaos Divine Body was the publicly acknowledged strongest physique. They did not expect there to be an accident. “The Chaos Divine Body is actually ranked second. Haha, Brother Qin, Feng’er’s physique is incredible. It looks like the first place is your son’s special physique!” Situ Nan exclaimed in surprise. Thinking of how extraordinary Qin Feng was when he was born, his physique was really something to look forward to.
 was  “Haha, I hope so. Still, it’s unexpected that the Chaos Divine Body is ranked second!” Qin Jingyun could no longer conceal the joy in his heart.
 Many elders of the Qin family were equally happy as their hearts began beating violently. They were somewhat nervous and excited since the first place might really be Qin Feng’s physique.
 He had a powerful physique that no one knew about, and the other was stronger than the Chaos Divine Body.
 What is it?
  At this moment, countless living beings in the entire Forsaken Immortal Realm were staring at the top of the rankings together, waiting for a name they had never heard of.
 “It’s here, it’s here. The first place is about to be announced!”
 “What is this strongest physique?”
 Physique Rankings # 1: Human Body
 In an instant, the entire Immortal Realm fell silent.
 Everyone seemed to have stopped at this moment, even their breathing and heartbeat.
 They even thought they had seen it wrongly.
 The best physique in the universe was actually… the human body?
    
Chapter 179 Dumbfounded Faces  Human body???
 Gongshu Qitian’s eyes widened slightly, and a glimmer of surprise surfaced in his calm eyes.
 Even when he saw himself in second place, he did not feel as emotional as now.
 The strongest physique in the universe, which surpassed the Chaos Divine Body, was actually the human body?
 It was as if the heavens were playing a prank on everyone.
 The Qin Family’s Heavenly Star Palace was silent.
 Everyone looked baffled.
  As for Qin Feng, standing on the platform. He carefully looked at the two words at the top of the rankings. He was also perplexed.
 Obviously, the physique at the top did not belong to him.
 Furthermore, he could not understand what kind of physique this human body possessed.
 It could not be the literal meaning, right?
 “Brother Qin, do you think there’s something deeper about this final physique?” Situ Nan could not understand it. He naturally did not think that this human body was really just a human body.
 A physique that could surpass all kinds of Divine Bodies was definitely not the most ordinary human body.
 “I don’t understand either. What kind of physique is this type of human body?” Qin Jingyun shook his head and smiled bitterly. He was once looking forward to the top spot until such an unforeseen and unbelievable physique was revealed.
 At the moment, countless people from the various large families and factions of the Forsaken Immortal Realm were dumbfounded and filled with questions.
 “The first place is too strange. The top 20 already have various Saint Bodies and Overlord Bodies. The top five basically have divine bodies. Yet, the human body suddenly appeared at the top.”
 “Yeah, is the Heavenly Dao telling us that the human body is the strongest physique in the universe?”
 “It can’t be, right? This shouldn’t be the literal meaning of the human body. Moreover, the Heavenly Dao Rankings said that the owners of the physique would be announced and rewarded. If it’s really the ordinary human body. Wouldn’t every human be rewarded?”
 “Hmm, you have a point. Perhaps there’s another meaning. I really wonder who the owner of the top physique is. This makes me really curious all of a sudden!”
 “That’s right. This human body must be something else to be ranked ahead of the Chaos Divine Body. I wonder if this person is in our Immortal Realm or another Immortal Realm? We can only wait for the Heavenly Dao Rankings to announce the owner of the physique to find out!”
 As the Heavenly Physique Rankings ended, the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings began to be announced.
 The first place on the Heavenly Physique Rankings in the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect made everyone in the sect discuss it for a while.
     

 However, they could not exactly figure out what the words ‘human body’ meant.
 The simple words seemed to have become an eternal, unsolved mystery.
 It was as if it was the Great Dao that no one could fully comprehend.
 At the moment, Dao Yanzi brought three Immortal Spirit Realm disciples along with Lu Yuchen and Lu Li, who had taken Lu Yufan’s appearance. There were a total of six people.
 They arrived at a forbidden area of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect to meet Lu Fanchen. They prepared to activate the spatial teleportation array here to open the spatial barrier to the lower realm.
 “Junior Brother, be careful. Fan’er, Chen’er, take good care of your uncle-master!” Lu Fanchen instructed.
 Dao Yanzi cupped his hands.
 Lu Yufan and Lu Yuchen nodded as well.
 On the side, more than ten elders of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect activated the spatial teleportation array together, using their magic power to maintain the stability of the spatial passageway.
 “Alright, please set off!” An elder said.
 It was extremely tricky to maintain the spatial passageway. The group had to enter it quickly while it was stable.
 Dao Yanzi and the others immediately flew into the teleportation array and disappeared into the spatial passageway.
 In the Lingtian Mystic Realm. After Li Yu acquired the Dao Seeking Tower’s recognition, he quickly headed to the Pan Emperor Immortal Abode.
 It was a valley with majestic and beautiful scenery. According to the system’s instructions, the immortal abode should be under the valley.
 “Xin Ba, is your Nine-Headed Lion race good at digging holes?” Li Yu turned to ask the human-form Xin Ba beside him.
 “I’m not good at it!” Xin Ba replied expressionlessly.
  “Sure, you’ll be good at it after today. Go, dig a tunnel down from here!” Li Yu ordered.
 II
 11
 “What’s the matter? Do you need me to do it myself?” Li Yu raised his hand, and Xin Ba immediately moved swiftly and transformed into the divine beast Suan Ni.
 Its two front hooves were like two giant shovels of an excavator as it began to dig the ground crazily.
 Rumble!
 The ground shook as soil flew. Before long, a huge hole appeared.
 “And you say you’re not good at it? Your digging technique is already better than a mole!” Li Yu remarked.
 III
 After some time, Xin Ba and Li Yu found the underground cave. They discovered a gate in the cave, and the two words carved on it were still clearly visible.
     

 “Sword Sect!” Li Yu looked at the two words on the mountain gate in surprise.
 Clearly, this was the entry gate of a sect in the Immortal Realm, and this sect was called the Sword Sect.
 It was concise, but it revealed an inexplicable dominance.
 It was like a true expert who never needed fancy stuff to defeat his enemy in one move.
 It seemed like an ordinary strike, but it possessed the most lethality.
 Mm, yep, that’s me.
 Furthermore, this ‘Sword Sect’ might have a different interpretation. On the surface, it was a sect that cultivated the Sword Dao.
 However, other than sect, the word ‘sect[1]’ also had the meaning of ancestors, purpose, and origin.
 As the saying goes, all changes are bound to the same source. The Sword Sect seemed to have the source of the Sword Dao in the world, the true meaning of the Sword Dao.
 A sect that dared to use those two words seemed extraordinary enough.
 That’s it from the system’s guide, but there doesn’t seem to be anything else besides the entry gate here.
 Li Yu thought as he carefully looked at the system’s guide.
 Based on his experience in the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s treasury, fortune and fate were required to enter the immortal abode.
 Since this immortal abode belonged to Ji Qinglan’s fortune and opportunity, he might have the correct way.
 Therefore, Li Yu brought out the Mi Lu Immortal Palace again to bring Ji Qinglan out.
 Upon seeing the Mi Lu Immortal Palace, Xin Ba’s eyes suddenly lit up. With his divine sense, Xin Ba could naturally tell that this Immortal Palace was extraordinary. Li Yu’s luck was incredible to obtain such an Immortal Palace.
 “Follow me!” Li Yu called.
 Xin Ba was curious about what was in the Immortal Palace. Hearing Li Yu’s instructions, he immediately followed Li Yu into the Immortal Palace excitedly.
 “Greetings, Master!” The guardian spirit of the Immortal Palace appeared and knelt on one knee.
 Li Yu nodded casually and walked towards the teleportation array. Meanwhile, Xin Ba looked around curiously.
 When he followed Li Yu through the teleportation array to the Misty Immortal Island, he saw the fairyland-like island, and the fearsome Qilin addressed Li Yu as its master.
  Xin Ba could not be more shocked when he saw the group of fairies address Li Yu as their master.
 He believed that he was knowledgeable and blessed with luck. He had seen many immortal ruins in the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm.
 Yet, it was still an eye-opener today.
 Especially when he saw Ye Qiu and Gu Yuqi, he felt even more frustrated when he realized that their cultivation levels were also at the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 Previously, he thought that he was the only one who could obtain a great opportunity and leap into the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 Little did he know that Li Yu’s two junior brothers had already stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 His fortunes and opportunities seemed to have become worthless all of a sudden.
 [1] Refers to the Chinese character, Zong (5) with multiple meanings
    
Chapter 180 Ji Qinglan’s Opportunity  “Divine beast Suan Ni? Master, is this your friend?” The Qilin Beast, General Guo, sized up Xin Ba curiously.
 As the knowledgeable divine beast, he could recognize what kind of divine beast Xin Ba was.
 “A new mount!” Li Yu replied.
 The divine beast Qilin immediately revealed an excited expression. “So it’s Master’s mount. This is great. I finally have a companion from now on!”
 A divine beast like the Qilin was usually born from heaven and earth. Unlike the Nine-Headed Lions, Azure Dragons, and other demons with a considerably large race.
 Therefore, divine beasts were usually lonely and had no siblings, and meeting people of the same kind was an extravagant hope.
 Although the Suan Ni was rumored to be the son of the Divine Azure Dragon, it was actually similar to a Qilin and was considered a close relative.
  Hence, since they were both divine beasts, the Qilin felt that it had met its own kind today.
 “Congratulations on becoming my master’s mount!” General Guo said with a big smile.
 Xin Ba forced a smile. If not for the fact that he sensed that this Qilin was much stronger than him, he would definitely ignore him.
 Congratulations? What’s there to celebrate?
 “He hasn’t been fully tamed yet. And you can help me train him well and teach him how to be a qualified mount!” Li Yu smiled.
 “Understood, Master. Leave it to me!” General Guo patted his chest.
 Xin Ba’s lips twitched as an ominous feeling arose.
 While Xin Ba was dragged away for training by General Guo, Li Yu arrived at Ji Qinglan’s seclusion spot. Coincidentally, Ji Qinglan had finished refining the Paragon Bone.
 At this stage, he had already stepped into the late stage of the Mahayana Realm with the Dragon Origin Fruit and the Paragon Bone.
 “Junior Brother Ji, I promised to give you a great fortune. Follow me!”
 Ji Qinglan was thrilled and surprised, and he followed Li Yu out of the Misty Immortal Island with anticipation.
 They arrived at the entry gate of the Sword Sect.
 “This is a place of opportunity I discovered. You have the Connate Sword Body. Perhaps this Sword Sect has a great fortune that belongs to you!” Li Yu introduced.
 The moment Ji Qinglan saw the entry gate, he was stunned as if he had been struck by lightning
 A storm suddenly brewed in his mind, and countless memory fragments sealed in the depths of his soul suddenly surfaced.
 Those memory fragments were in a mess, and the massive amount of information was like countless lightning bolts that bombarded Ji Qinglan’s mind.
 It gave him a splitting headache as he knelt on the ground and groaned in pain.
 Li Yu was quite surprised to see this. It seemed that Ji Qinglan was indeed somewhat related to the Sword Sect.
 However, Ji Qinglan’s reaction was a little unexpected. He seemed to be in pain.
 Elder Nie’s remnant soul flew out as well. He looked at Ji Qinglan worriedly before transforming into a wisp of light that shot into Ji Qinglan’s body. The pain on Ji Qinglan’s face eased.
 Immediately, he sat cross-legged on the spot and meditated. A ball of faint golden light enveloped his body, and his expression slowly recovered.
 After a long while, Ji Qinglan opened his eyes, and his gaze changed significantly.
 It was as if he had gone from a young child to an old man who had experienced the vicissitudes of life.
 Although the eyes were still youthfully bright and sharp, they were also deep and steady.
 “Elder Nie, thank you. Are you alright?” Ji Qinglan was concerned.
 Fortunately, Elder Nie had used his soul energy to assist Ji Qinglan in linking those broken memories.
 Otherwise, those sealed memory fragments would probably severely injure his already weak soul again.
 “I’m fine. It’s just that I’ve used up too much soul power. I have to rest first!”
 Elder Nie’s remnant soul phantom flew out of Ji Qinglan’s body. It had become even more transparent, and his voice was incomparably weak.
 He flew into the Reverse Scale Immortal Sword again and disappeared.
 “Junior Brother, are you alright? What happened just now?” Li Yu asked. He was unsure of the exact situation despite making some speculations.
 “I remember something about my previous life. Thank you for bringing me here, Senior Brother. You’re right. I’m indeed related to this place, and I do have an opportunity here!” Ji Qinglan looked at the entry gate again and talked in a deep voice.
 There was a sense of reminiscence and sorrow in his gaze.
  ane
 However, it instantly became calm and collected.
 Li Yu nodded. It was close to his guess, but he was still clueless about Ji Qinglan’s relationship with the Sword Sect.
 However, he did not ask further. If Ji Qinglan wanted to tell him, he would naturally tell him.
 Everyone had their own past and secrets.
 Ji Qinglan looked into the entry gate. The stone walls suddenly began to tremble violently, and rumbling sounds were heard.
 The next second. A stream of light broke through the stone wall and shot out. It instantly landed in Ji Qinglan’s hand. It was a sword hilt.
 Soft hums sounded from the sword hilt as if a family was cheering after reuniting with their loved ones.
 Right at this moment, the stone wall suddenly let out cracking sounds as if it had been blown up by a bomb.
 Streams of light shot out from the shattered stone wall, turning into sword shards that gathered at the hilt in Ji Qinglan’s hand.
 In the end, the shards combined into an intact sword.
 Damn, Thousand Demon Daggers!
 Li Yu could not help but yell a name in his heart.
 As the sword fragments flew off, a massive tunnel was exposed on the stone wall.
 “Senior Brother, follow me!” Ji Qinglan said and led the way into the tunnel.
 Forsaken Immortal Realm, Primordial Dao Immortal Sect.
 Not long after the spatial passageway connecting the Jingxing Realm closed, yelling sounded from afar. “Dad! Dad! Wait, wait!”
 SO
 A trace of surprise flashed through Lu Fanchen’s eyes when he heard this voice, and he immediately frowned.
 He was all too familiar with this voice. It was his son, Lu Yufan.
 Indeed, he looked over and saw Lu Yufan running over anxiously.
 Lu Fanchen and the elders looked at each other in surprise. They had just sent Lu Yufan, Dao Yanzi, and the others off.
 Why did Lu Yufan suddenly appear here?
 “Fan’er? You, what’s going on? Didn’t you just…” Lu Fanchen was also a little dumbfounded.
 “Dad, Lu Li, that kid Lu Li knocked me out and used an Illusion Talisman to transform into my appearance and aura. The one who descended with Uncle-Master and Big Brother wasn’t me. It was Lu Li!” Lu Yufan huffed angrily.
 “What? The one who just descended with your Uncle-Master Dao Yan was Lu Li?” Lu Fanchen’s expression changed.
 “That’s right. This brat’s cultivation has already entered the Upper Immortal realm. I was caught off guard and got tricked by her!” Lu Yufan was furious as he thought of what had happened not long ago.
 was
 It was not easy for him to obtain the chance to leave the immortal sect and visit the lower realm, and it was snatched away by Lu Li.
 He was now depressed.
 “This girl is simply messing around!” Lu Fanchen’s face was filled with worry. He did not know what was going on in the Jingxing Realm. If anything happened to his precious daughter, it would simply be cutting off his flesh.
 “Hold on, did you just say that Lu Li has already stepped into the Upper Immortal Realm? Is that true?” Lu Fanchen suddenly asked.
 “Yes, that’s right. She is in the Upper Immortal Realm. Otherwise, why would I be knocked out by her!” Lu Yufan puffed.
  “That’s good. No, I’m still worried. Elders, please open the spatial passageway again. I’m going down to bring my daughter back!” Lu Fanchen declared.
 “Dad, I’ll go. You can stay at home. I promise to bring Lu Li back safe and sound!” Lu Yufan pleaded.
 “I’ll be more worried if I let you go!”
 “Hall Master Lu, you can’t open the spatial passageway at any time. It has only just closed. It will only open after at least two hours!” an elder reminded Lu Fanchen.
 Two hours. That would be at least two to three days in the lower realm. Sigh, I hope this girl isn’t in any danger!
 Lu Fanchen murmured in his heart.
 At the moment, the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings in the sky had already been announced to the 35th place.
 Bloodline Rankings # 35: Suan Ni Bloodline
Chapter 181 What Kind of Bloodline Is Type A? (1)  In the Lingtian Mystic Realm, Li Yu followed Ji Qinglan through the tunnel and arrived at another underground cave.
 The cave was bone-chilling.
 In the middle of the cave stood a giant ice block that looked like a crystal.
 Runes were faintly discernible on the surface of the ice block, emitting a faint halo.
 A figure could be vaguely seen frozen in the ice block.
 “Senior Brother, can you help me break through this ice block?” Ji Qinglan requested.
 “Who is inside?” Li Yu asked.
  “It’s me, me from my previous life!” Ji Qinglan replied.
 Li Yu came to a realization and did not say anything else. He raised his hand and punched. With a bang, the ice block shattered.
 At the same time, the frozen figure inside shattered.
 Ji Qinglan sat cross-legged and formed hand seals. He tapped his glabella, and a golden thread shot out.
 It instantly dashed into the shattered figure. Immediately, the wisps of remnant souls were guided by the golden threads to fly back into his body and enter his glab After a long while, Ji Qinglan opened his eyes again, and his gaze became brighter and more in-depth. “Thank you, Senior Brother! Elder Nie once said that my soul was incomplete. Now, it’s finally complete!”
 Li Yu smiled without a word and looked at Ji Qinglan with a ‘Please tell me your story.’ expression.
 Ji Qinglan roughly described his previous life.
 The story was not complicated. Ji Qinglan was the strongest Sword Immortal in the Sword Sect during his previous life. Later on, the Sword Devil invaded, and the sect was in danger.
 No divine power or technique could do anything to the Sword Devil.
 Therefore, Ji Qinglan, in his previous life, remembered that he had once seen an ancient forbidden technique from a secret manual.
 He used a portion of his soul as a sacrifice and used a forbidden technique to suppress the terrifying Sword Devil and seal it in the Sword mountain.
 The price of using this forbidden technique was that his body was poisoned by the blood curse poison.
 This poison could not be cured. If Ji Qinglan’s body was corroded completely, he would become the most terrifying Devil.
 It would also spread the poison of the blood curse to others.
 Therefore, Ji Qinglan sealed himself into ice in his previous life.
 After hearing Ji Qinglan’s story, apart from lamenting the tragedy of that previous life, Li Yu suddenly thought of a problem.
 The story seemed unrelated to the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode mentioned in the mission.
 Instead, the Pan Emperor’s Life Dagger he had pulled out of the demon god’s head sounded more related to the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode.
 However, Li Yu was in no hurry. Since Ji Qinglan’s opportunity was the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode, there must be a way to enter.
 After explaining his past, Ji Qinglan recalled a place, so he quickly brought Li Yu along a tunnel in the cave to another underground cave.
 “In my previous life, this was the forbidden area of the Sword Sect. I was fortunate enough to come here once. There’s a sword here. No one knows where it came from or its name, but it’s said that this sword is cursed. Anyone who touches this sword will instantly age, and their lifespan will be greatly reduced!” Ji Qinglan explained.
 “Have you touched that sword in your previous life?” Li Yu asked curiously.
 “No, my master forbade me from touching it. My master didn’t even touch it! But when I saw that sword that time, I felt a voice in my heart calling for me. However, I couldn’t disobey my master’s orders, so I didn’t attempt to touch that sword.” Ji Qinglan added.
 Li Yu’s eyes flickered slightly, and he sensed that this might be the key to continuing the Pan Emperor Immortal Palace mission.
 The two passed through a long tunnel and finally arrived at another cave. This place was also protected by a powerful restriction.
 However, any restriction was useless in front of Li Yu.
 After breaking through the restriction, Li Yu saw a rusty black sword hilt with a white blade stuck in the cave.
 At this moment, the system interface popped up in front of Li Yu again…
 A trace of surprise flashed through Li Yu’s eyes when he saw the information.
 “Pan Emperor’s Time Sword!”
 This name immediately reminded Li Yu of the Pan Emperor’s Life Dagger he had previously obtained.
 It was clear that these two swords were related, and it was definitely linked to the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode in the mission.
 Li Yu quickly took out the Pan Emperor’s Life Dagger. Indeed, the two swords instantly triggered a reaction.
 The Pan Emperor’s Time Sword stuck in the ground immediately buzzed. The sword shook, and the rust faded, revealing the jade-like sword body inside.
 It emitted a faint halo as the rocks on the ground slowly cracked.
 Ji Qinglan was pleasantly surprised to see this.
 He was curious about this sword and supposed that it did not seem to be the legendary cursed sword.
 It might be waiting for its master, and now its wait seemed to be over.
 “Qinglan, draw that sword.” Li Yu ordered.
  Ji Qinglan looked at Li Yu and saw the certainty in his eyes. He immediately walked forward and grabbed the sword.
 In an instant, the Pan Emperor’s Time Sword hissed. The world shook as boundless energy surged.
 The sword was instantly pulled out.
 At the same time, the ground and the surrounding stone walls cracked open, and golden light shot out from the cracks.
 It was like the morning sun parting the dark clouds, making one feel extremely comfortable.
 Rich immortal power instantly filled the entire cave, and the cracked stones turned into dust that dissipated. The original cave had turned into a dazzling immortal hall with carved railings.
 Looks like this is the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode!
 Li Yu thought.
Chapter 182 What Kind of Bloodline Is Type A? (2)  Li Yu did not expect the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode to be hidden in the forbidden area of the Sword Sect, and the Pan Emperor’s Time Sword was the key to entering the Immortal Abode.
 Perhaps the rumors were accurate. Ordinary people might suffer a backlash from touching the Pan Emperor’s Time Sword, reducing their lifespan.
 However, it was not the case for those who were fated. Ji Qinglan was clearly the fated person of the Pan Emperor Immortal Abode.
 “Welcome to the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode!” A voice sounded.
 Immediately, a wisp of green smoke rose from a lamp.
 Then, it transformed into a translucent figure.
 A Genie?
  Li Yu’s eyes brightened.
 “I’m surprised there are two fated people!” said the translucent figure.
 “Let me introduce myself first. I’m the lamp god and butler of this immortal abode. I have been waiting for the arrival of the fated person on behalf of my master…
 The lamp god rambled on. Li Yu almost wanted to kill him with one strike.
 Fortunately, he suddenly summoned a crystal coffin from the ground, reigniting Li Yu’s curiosity.
 “Since you are my master’s successor, you must help him take care of his child. This is his lifelong regret!” the lamp god continued.
 Take care of his child?
 Li Yu and Ji Qinglan sized up the figure in the crystal coffin curiously. It looked like a middle-aged man.
 His face was rosy, and his breathing was calm. He was still alive.
     

 “My master was invincible all his life. He even comprehended the three supreme Great Daos, life, time, and the void. And stood at the top of the world. Still, sadly, he was unable to save his child.
 “This child was born without a soul, but he can grow like a normal person. Moreover, according to my master, his child also possesses an extremely rare and powerful physique…
 A body without a soul? And a powerful physique?
 Upon hearing this, Ji Qinglan and Li Yu looked at each other almost in sync and saw through each other’s thoughts-Elder Nie.
 Elder Nie’s remnant soul needed a physical body so that he could really revive.
 They could not believe that they had found a suitable body here.
 A body without a soul and a rare and powerful physique.
 “No problem. Don’t worry. We’ll definitely take good care of this child. We’ll even help him live in this world like a normal person!” Li Yu smiled.
 “Hmm, very good. I hope you won’t disappoint my master. Alright, I don’t have much time left. Fortunately, the mission my master gave me is finally completed…
 The lamp god suddenly became illusory.
 “Oh yes, what kind of physique does this child have?” Li Yu asked.
 “I can’t remember. I only remember that it was some kind of Ancestral Divine Body,” The lamp god replied, “It’s time, fated ones, accept the gift from my master!”
 After saying that, the lamp god turned into a wisp of green smoke and returned to the
 lamp.
 The lamp suddenly went out after a slight flicker.
 At the same time, countless golden runes manifested from the void and fused into Ji Qinglan’s body.
 It instantly transformed into majestic energy to nourish his body. At the same time, it transformed into information that fused into Ji Qinglan’s memories.
 Li Yu was not surprised by all of this. Clearly, Ji Qinglan was the fated person who met the Pan Emperor’s requirements.
 It had nothing to do with him, but Li Yu did not mind. After all, these inheritances were useless to him.
     

 Ji Qinglan sat on the ground again and began to digest and absorb those inheritances.
 Li Yu strolled around the immortal abode. However, at this moment, a mountain outside the valley suddenly shook as if there was an earthquake. The mountain shook, the trees fell, and sand, stones, and dust flew.
 Not only that, but the mountain kept rising as if it was about to leave the ground and fly into the air.
 Before long, the verdant mountain became a bare stone mountain.
 Countless swords had been stuck in the mountain. Some had half their bodies exposed, while others only had their handles exposed.
 The entire Stone Mountain was like a hedgehog
 Hum— Hum— Hum
 Countless swords shook in unison, emitting sword hums that resounded through the world.
 Boundless energy transformed into a gigantic sword shadow that pointed into the sky above the mountain.
 The loud noise and phenomenon immediately attracted the nearby cultivators. Group after group of cultivators flew towards the Sword Mountain.
 In the Forsaken Immortal Realm, Lu Fanchen paced around the courtyard anxiously, waiting for the elders to help open the passageway to the lower realm again.
 Meanwhile, Lu Yufan held his chin and stared at the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings in the sky. At this moment, the rankings had already been announced to the top 20.
 Bloodline Ranking # 18: White Tiger Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 17: Vermillion Bird Bloodline
 The Vermillion Bird bloodline is ahead of the White Tiger bloodline!
  Lu Yufan murmured in his heart.
 To him, these special bloodlines were unrelated to him, and he could only watch.
 In their Primordial Dao Immortal Sect, only the sect master and the Grand Elder possessed a trace of the Fire Qilin bloodline and Chao Feng’s bloodline. As for the others, they did not seem to have any special bloodlines.
 The first on the Physique Rankings is the human body. What will the first on the Bloodline Rankings be? Could it be another existence that subverts my understanding?
 Lu Yufan thought and looked forward to it even more.
 At the same time, in the Phoenix Ancient Cave in the eastern region of the Forsaken Immortal Realm.
 The new Ancient Cave Phoenix Emperor, Huo Wu, stood on top of the Myriad Brilliance Tower and stared at the rankings.
 She was the only person in the entire Phoenix Clan who had the Vermillion Bird bloodline. Not only that, but she also possessed the Phoenix Overlord Body that few knew about.
    
Chapter 183 What Kind of Bloodline Is Type A? (3)  Huo Wu was only ranked fourth on the entire Forsaken Immortal Realm’s Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 However, in terms of power level, she was confident that she might not lose to Ao Ying and Gongshu Qitian.
 In fact, if she used the Phoenix Overlord Body’s forbidden technique, even Gongshu Qitian might not be her match.
 Furthermore, even without the Sons of Heaven Rankings, she was once part of the three elites of the Immortal Domain, along with Gongshu Qitian and Ao Ying.
 She was the most dazzling existence among the geniuses of the Immortal Realm’s younger generation.
 If I’m not wrong, the Three-legged Crow bloodline should be on the rankings. I wonder who the owner of this bloodline is?
 To her, the bloodline she yearned for the most was the Golden Crow bloodline.
  She was confident that she could become the number one prodigy in the Immortal Realm.
 Bloodline Ranking # 16: Divine Azure Dragon Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 15: Roc Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 14: Responding Dragon Bloodline
 In the Dragon King Hall, the current prodigy of the dragon race, Ao Ying, frowned slightly. “I didn’t expect that my Responding Dragon’s bloodline could only rank 14th!”
 “If I’m not wrong, there should be the bloodline of the twelve Divine Ancestral Demon ahead!” The current Dragon King, Ao Ye, remarked.
 “Father, does our dragon race have a bloodline that can surpass the Ancestral Demons?” Ao Ying asked.
 “Of course, the Ancestral Dragon Bloodline!” Ao Ye replied.
 “Ancestral Dragon Bloodline?” Ao Ying looked yearning. “If only I could obtain it!”
     

 “The Ancestral Dragon Bloodline has long been lost. It has even become a legend. I’m afraid that it might not even be on the Heavenly Dao Rankings this time!” Ao Ye remarked.
 10n  “See? As expected, the Ancestral Demon bloodlines are all in front.”
 Bloodline Rankings # 13: Ancestral Demon Fu Zi’s Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 12: Ancestral Demon Xuanming Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 11: Ancestral Demon Gonggong Bloodline
 Bloodline Rankings # 10: Ancestral Demon Zhu Rong’s Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 9: Ancestral Demon Gou Mang’s Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 8: Ancestral Demon Qiangliang’s Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 7: Ancestral Demon Candle Dragon Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 6: Ancestral Demon Di Jiang Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 5: Three-legged Crow Bloodline
  Bloodline Ranking # 4: Nine Heavens Dark Lady Bloodline
 In the Qin Family’s Heavenly Star Palace. After the Son of Heaven’s appointment ceremony ended, the banquet was scheduled to begin.
 However, all the guests and the Qin family were focused on the Bloodline Rankings.
 Several top experts in the Qin family had once obtained some divine beast blood essence.
 Qin Jingyun and the Qin family’s Patriarch had even obtained a trace of Ancestral Demon blood essence.
 Therefore, they wanted to know what kind of ranking the corresponding bloodline they obtained was.
     

 “There are only eight Ancestral Demon bloodlines on the rankings?”
 “Hmm, that should be the case. Looks like four more Ancestral Demon blood essence have yet to be obtained by anyone!”
 “It’s already shocking enough to have eight Ancestral Demon blood essence. Ancestral Demon blood essence is so precious that it can only be encountered by chance!”
 “The Three-legged Crow bloodline and the Nine Heavens Dark Lady bloodline have actually appeared. Incredible! And there are three more bloodlines in front of them!”
 “Could it be that even the bloodlines of Pangu and Nuwa are coming up?” Everyone in the Qin family discussed animatedly.
 The third and second place on the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings were announced.
 Bloodline Ranking # 3: Ancestral Dragon Bloodline
 Bloodline Ranking # 2: Nuwa’s Bloodline
 “Oh heavens. There really is the Nuwa bloodline!”
 “The Ancestral Dragon Bloodline has also appeared. Who could have it? Could it be someone from the Dragon King Hall?”
 “This is unbelievable. Looks like the first place must be the Pangu bloodline. With the Pangu and Nuwa bloodlines appearing together, something big is probably happening in the universe!”
 “Hmm, the appearance of the Heavenly Dao Rankings itself indicates something!”
 Everyone knew that only the Pangu bloodline could rank ahead of the Nuwa bloodline in the universe.
 In the Dragon King Hall, Ao Ying’s eyes brightened when she saw the third-ranked Ancestral Dragon Bloodline.
 “Father, the Ancestral Dragon Bloodline does exist. It has appeared!” Ao Ying exclaimed.
  As long as the Ancestral Dragon Bloodline was on the rankings, it meant that someone possessed it.
 However, he did not know if the owner of this bloodline was an enemy or a friend. Or if he had the chance to obtain such a coveted bloodline?
 “This Bloodline Rankings has just exposed a lot of unreal bloodlines. Even the Nuwa bloodline has emerged! Looks like the first place must be the Pangu bloodline!” Ao Ye lamented in surprise.
 Suddenly.
 Under the gaze of countless living beings in the Immortal Realm, the information of the first place slowly appeared on the Bloodline Rankings.
 Bloodline Ranking # 1: Type A
 ???
 What kind of bloodline was Type A?
    
Chapter 184 Interpretation of Type A (1)  Bloodline Ranking # 1: Type A
 In the entire Forsaken Immortal Realm.
 The various ancient families, royal families, eternal factions, eternal orthodoxies, and countless other races. Their faces were filled with confusion and surprise.
 The top on the Physique Rankings had already overturned their understanding once and improved their ability to accept new and unknown things.
 However, when they saw the top of the Bloodline Rankings, they were still stumped and shocked.
 Tere  This… What kind of bloodline is Type A?
  And, what kind of ugly and strange symbol is that? And what did it mean?
 Everyone was dumbfounded. Everyone had thought that only the Pangu bloodline could rank ahead of the Nuwa bloodline.
 However, they did not expect that the top of the Bloodline Rankings was actually a bloodline that they knew nothing about.
 “This number one bloodline is not as easy to understand as the top of the Physique Rankings. At least I can understand the words ‘human body,’ but I’m clueless on this!”
 “Could it be… that ‘A’ is some kind of supreme Great Dao symbol?”
 “Perhaps it’s some unknown bloodline!”
     

 “This symbol looks like the tip of a sword, and it’s a little similar to the character ‘human.’ Could this bloodline be related to the top human on the Physique Rankings?”
 “That’s possible. The first place on both rankings is so weird. They might even belong to the same person!”
 “So what if it’s the same person? We still don’t understand what this bloodline is!”
 Countless people discussed and speculated, feeling an unsolved mystery had emerged.
 They were filled with curiosity, but they could not arrive at the truth. Everyone could only scratch heads and speculate the possibilities.
 “Father, what bloodline is this?” Ao Ying looked at Ao Ye in confusion.
 Ao Ye shook his head with a similar confused expression. He felt that the first on the Physique Rankings and the first on the Bloodline Rankings were likely to become the unsolved mystery of the universe.
 If anyone wanted to know the answer, he might have to wait until the Heavenly Dao Rankings announced the owner of the bloodline and physique and find the owner of ‘Type A’ and the ‘Human Body.’
 “This ranking is really whetting my appetite! I’m looking forward to the Heavenly Dao Rankings announcing the owners. I wonder who the owner of the human body and Type A bloodline is?”
 At the moment, countless people are equally curious about the top of the rankings as Dragon King Ao Ye.
 Moreover, it was not only the Forsaken Immortal Realm. There were also countless factions in the other immortal realms like the Profound Heaven, the Luo Heaven, and the Nether Heaven. The experts were incomparably curious.
 However, it was clear that they could only wait for a month before the Heavenly Dao Rankings revealed the answer.
 In the Night God Realm, the Heavenly Physique Rankings and Bloodline Rankings were hung high in the starry night sky.
 The Realm Master, the Evernight Heavenly Venerable, sat on the white jade lotus. His deep eyes looked at the Bloodline Rankings with slight surprise.
 “The world is vast, and the universe is endless. Humans are like a grain of rice in the vast ocean. Even though I’ve lived for tens of millions of years, I’ve still never heard of such a bloodline or physique! There are indeed too many extraordinary things in the universe!”
 The Evernight Heavenly Venerable sighed to himself. He thought that he had understood the Great Dao and everything in the world.
 However, today’s Heavenly Physique Rankings and Bloodline Rankings made him realize that there were still limitations to what he knew. What he knew was still only the tip of the iceberg of the universe.
     

 The Heavenly Dao was the Heavenly Dao, after all. He was still a bird that could not break free from its cage.
 Forsaken Immortal Realm, Human Immortal Sect.
 As one of the eternal orthodoxies of the Forsaken Immortal Realm, the power of the Human Immortal Sect was on par with the various ancient families and royals.
 The main reason was that they were the source of mainstream ideology and orthodoxy in the Forsaken Immortal Realm. Their sect’s ideals and Dao techniques had educated and influenced countless people in the Immortal Realm.
 Many disciples were scattered throughout the various Immortal Realms and even the entire universe.
 Immortal sects like the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect were inseparably linked to the Human Immortal Sect.
 Many large family clans, large factions, and even members of the ancient families were once disciples of the Human Immortal Sect.
 Hence, it was even above the ancient families and royals in foundation and prestige.
 Today was the day of the debate between the Human Immortal Sect and the Heaven and Earth Sect, both eternal orthodoxies.
 The two sects had always had many differences and collisions in philosophy and ideas.
 The Human Immortal Sect focused on humans, while the Heaven and Earth Sect focused on everything in the world. It was like the difference between idealism and materialism.
 Therefore, the debate between the two sides was intense and impossible to determine a winner.
  Coincidentally, the top of the Physique Rankings happened to be the human body.
 The Human Immortal Sect Master had an idea and used the topic to analyze and interpret this ‘Human Body.’
 He argued that the human body was the literal meaning and the idea they advocated. The human heart was the universe, the consciousness was the sky, and the body was the ground.
 This ideology explained why the Heavenly Dao Rankings ranked the human body as the strongest physique in the world.
 With the number one human body on the Physique Rankings, the debate of the Human Immortal Sect had the upper hand. After all, the Heaven and Earth Sect could not understand the reality of this human body becoming the strongest physique in the world.
 After all, they would not dare to question the authority of the Heavenly Dao.
 However, the Human Immortal Sect Master did not expect that the first place on the Bloodline Rankings had given him another riddle to solve.
 “Heavenly Human Saint Lord, you interpreted the first place on the Physique Rankings wonderfully just now. I wonder how you would interpret the top of the Bloodline Rankings?” The Heaven and Earth Sect Master questioned.
    
Chapter 185 Interpretation of Type A (2)  The sect master of the Human Immortal Sect, the Heavenly Human Saint Lord, looked at the Type A blood with melancholy. He also wanted to know what the hell this bloodline
 was.
 He did not even recognize that strange symbol and did not know how to decipher it. How could he interpret it?
 In an instant, the Heavenly Human Saint Lord felt a few strands of his hair turn white, and billions of brain cells died.
 He looked at the first place on the Bloodline Rankings with calm eyes, but he was frantically organizing his thoughts.
 He had already made a good start and finally gained the upper hand. He could not give up so easily.
 After all, many spectators were watching. The debate today would definitely spread throughout the Immortal Realm.
  “To surpass Nuwa, this bloodline must be above the gods.
 “I don’t think anyone here has seen that strange symbol before, but I’m suggesting that it must be some sort of particularly ancient text. “Everyone, please take a closer look. It should not be difficult to tell that the shape of this word is extremely similar to the word ‘human.’ However, it is straight and unyielding, and the top is sharper like the tip of a sword.
 “There is a horizontal line in the middle representing the ground under our feet.
 “I’m not knowledgeable enough, so I boldly speculate that this symbol represents a person standing between the heavens and the earth with his feet rooted to the ground. His aura is like a sword pointing at the sky. He doesn’t submit or bend. He naturally has the bravery to conquer the heavens.
     

 “And I believe that I don’t need to read too much into the word ‘Type.’ It might be a type of law, a type of idea. It doesn’t represent a single individual but a group phenomenon.
 “In conclusion, I believe that the top of the Bloodline Rankings should be similar to the top of the Physique Rankings.
 “The Heavenly Dao wants to tell the world that if the human heart is powerful, it can carry the world, protect everything, surpass the gods, and control all techniques…
 The Heavenly Human Saint Lord’s words seemed to have enlightened everyone. They instantly saw the light to solve the mystery.
 Immediately, the place cheered. Everyone nodded and clapped in praise. Even many from the Heaven and Earth Sect expressed approval.
 As for the Heaven and Earth Sect’s Heavenly Connection Saint Lord. He was also a little speechless.
 This old fellow is simply a genius!
 Of course, the current Heavenly Human Saint Lord also felt the same. He was even convinced by his wild guess and believed he had really explained the heavenly secrets.
 Still, what he said was only speculation, so he pondered for a moment before saying, “Of course, this is only my speculation for the time being. After this debate is over, I’ll flip through the ancient books to see if I can find this ancient word to verify it.”
 “Zi Zhong, immediately lead your junior brothers to check the ancient books and see if you can find any evidence!” The Heavenly Human Saint Lord looked at the disciple beside him.
 “Yes, Master!” The young man named Zi Zhong bowed with cupped hands. Soon, he quickly left with his junior brothers to check the ancient books.
 In the Pan Emperor Immortal Abode. The Type A blood and human body owner-Li Yu —was completely unaware of how much confusion and commotion the immortals of the Nine Heavens Immortal Realm were experiencing when he casually filled in his particulars for physique and bloodline back then.
 He could not know how many brain cells they had lost or that they could not understand what it meant.
 In order to understand this physique and bloodline, many flipped through ancient books and almost dug up their ancestor’s graves to find the answer.
 At the moment, he was happy for Ji Qinglan to enter the Immortal Spirit Realm. Indeed, a junior brother who came with his own opportunities saved him a lot of resources.
     

 Ji Qinglan had also successfully stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm. Tang Chi would probably enter the Immortal Spirit Realm in a few days.
 Including Gu Yuqi, Wu Chang, and Ye Qiu, the Qingyun Sect would soon have five immortals.
 Of course, if Ji Wanjie was included, it would be six.
 Li Yu had already known Ji Wanjie had entered the Immortal Spirit Realm through the system, which he did not expect.
 Since Ji Wanjie could rely on his fortune to enter the Immortal Spirit Realm. It seemed that his luck was indeed extraordinary.
 Meanwhile, the Blood Spirit Monarch was less than three kilometers away from Li Yu’s group.
 The sudden appearance of Sword Mountain attracted a large number of human cultivators. Countless sects and families gathered here, and even the people from the seven Holy Lands were present.
 After all, there were countless immortal swords stuck into the sword mountain, and there were even many Dao Artifact-level immortal swords.
 The entire mountain was simply a divine weapon treasure vault that was incomparably alluring.
 The entire Sword Mountain was bustling with noise and excitement for a time.
  Everyone flew into the Sword Mountain and tried to pull out those swords.
 However, those immortal swords seemed bound to the mountain by a special domain power. Most could not pull them out at all.
 It required immense magic power or even the cooperation of many to suppress the domain and remove the immortal swords.
 However, some people were lucky enough to obtain some immortal swords that recognized them as their masters, or some were not restrained by the special domain power to receive their immortal swords.
 “It’s a dao artifact. Senior Brother Chu’s luck is indeed remarkable!”
 Seeing that Chu Yunhe had obtained the recognition of a Dao Artifact-level flying sword, the Holy Land elites were filled with envy.
 “Look, the Holy Daughter of the Jade Pool has also obtained a Dao Artifact!” someone shouted.
 Many people went over to congratulate, and the Violet Palace Holy Son, Wu Qian, took the lead. “As expected of Junior Sister Yao Xi to obtain the recognition of a dao artifact so easily!”
    
Chapter 186 Interpretation of Type A (3)  Yao Xi smiled but did not speak.
 “Senior Sister, please let me have a look. This sword is beautiful!” The female guardian disciple beside Yao Xi asked enviously.
 She was Yao Xi’s guardian disciple and had followed her for a long time and had risked her life for her protection.
 The two of them were as close as kins. Seeing that the junior sister liked it, Yao Xi handed the sword to her. “If you like it, I’ll give it to
 you!”
 “Really? Thank you, Senior Sister. Thank you!” The female guardian disciple thanked them gratefully.
 “Come, we’ll take a look over there!” Yao Xi brought her junior sisters and quickly flew into the distance.
  “Hahaha, I’ve obtained the recognition of this immortal sword!”
 “Congratulations, Uncle-Master!”
 “Junior Brother, that sword isn’t good enough. Try another one!”
 “Everyone, work harder. We’re about to succeed. This is a dao artifact. We must not give up!” Thousands of cultivators displayed their abilities on the Sword Mountain, seeking their own opportunities.
 The entire Sword Mountain was bustling with noise and excitement.
 At the top of the mountain, an enormous ancient sword stood out like a crane in a flock of chickens. It was extremely eye-catching.
     

 The ancient sword was clearly extraordinary, and the aura it emitted was much stronger than all the swords on the Sword Mountain.
 The top experts and elites of the various Holy Lands tried, but no one could pull out the sword or obtain its recognition.
 “This ancient sword is probably the legendary Ancient Saint Weapon.”
 “Hmm, that’s possible! If we can obtain this sword. It’ll definitely be a heavenly opportunity!”
 “It’s a pity that we’re not strong enough to control this sword!”
 “Perhaps it’s waiting for someone fated!” People from the various Holy Lands gathered on the mountaintop and discussed.
 At the moment, many people were still attempting to pull out the ancient sword, but they all failed. Some were even injured by the backlash of the ancient sword.
 “A bunch of overconfident fellows. You mortals think you can control such an extraordinary divine weapon? You must be dreaming!”
 The Blood Spirit Monarch watched quietly among the crowd as everyone attempted to draw that sword. He could not help but sneer.
 “Let me give it a try!” An elder of the Million Swords Holy Land announced.
 Immediately, he flew to the ancient sword and began his attempt to pull it out. However, the ancient sword did not move at all after some effort.
 “Looks like we’re not fated!” The elder smiled helplessly.
 “Move!” The Blood Spirit Monarch yelled. Immediately, he released his aura and flew towards the ancient sword.
 Sensing the formidable aura emitted by the Blood Spirit Monarch, the expressions of everyone present changed. “Immortal Spirit Realm!” Everyone was shocked and instinctively spread out of the way.
 Their gazes gathered on the Blood Spirit Monarch, but no one knew him.
 “Who is this person? He has already entered the Immortal Spirit Realm!”
     

 “Looks like another one with great luck. I wonder if he can pull out that ancient sword!” Everyone discussed softly.
 The Blood Spirit Monarch was in high spirits as he circulated his magic power. Under the gazes of everyone, he grabbed the ancient sword.
 Rumble!
 The ancient sword suddenly shook, and even the entire mountain began to tremble.
 Everyone was shocked by the view.
 Could this person have a chance of pulling out this sword?
 The Blood Spirit Monarch injected magic power into the ancient sword and tried his best to pull it out.
 The ancient sword shook more and more violently, and its powerful aura transformed into circles of ripples that spread out.
 The entire Sword Mountain began to tremble as if there was an earthquake. Even the countless swords stuck in the mountain started to vibrate.
 Everyone looked at each other nervously while observing the enormous ancient sword rising in its aura.
 Suddenly, a loud bang sounded across the entire Sword Mountain. Then, a terrifying power erupted from the mountain.
  It transformed into an incomparably powerful shockwave that forced everyone on the Sword Mountain to retreat. Even the Blood Spirit Monarch was forced to step back.
 At the same time, the swords on the Sword Mountain began to vibrate as if they were controlled by a certain power.
 The next second…
 Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
 The gigantic ancient sword was the first to rise from the ground. Immediately, the countless swords flew up and left the sword mountain.
 At the same time, red lights flew out of the mountain and rapidly gathered at the top. They slowly transformed into a man with an evil face wearing a black robe with red patterns.
 Upon seeing this, the expressions of everyone present changed as they knew the situation was dire.
 They seemed to have gotten into trouble.
    
Chapter 187 Eldest Senior Brother, I Miss You So Much (1)  Rumble!
 Thunder seemed to rumble from afar as a terrifying pressure emitted from the evil man like the might of heaven.
 At the same time, the countless flying swords that flew up from the Sword mountain seemed to be guided by a specific force.
 They flew towards the evil-looking man’s head and circled him in the center like a school of fish.
 Not only that but the flying swords in everyone’s hands were also pulled out by the unknown power and flew towards the sea of swords above the evil-looking man’s head.
 Even the flying swords in their storage magic treasures flew out towards the giant vortex formed by the flying swords.
 This scene shocked every cultivator present as they looked at the evil man in horror.
  What kind of terrifying and powerful sword intent was that? What kind of top Sword Dao realm could snatch all of their swords?
 It even ignored the restrictions on the storage magic treasures.
 Yao Xi frowned in shock as she watched her intrinsic flying sword, the Alkaid sword, being snatched away.
 The Alkaid Sword was an intrinsic magic treasure nurtured by her Essence Soul and blood essence. It was connected to her bloodline and heart, almost like a part of her body.
 The Alkaid Sword was now controlled by an even more powerful and terrifying will, causing her to lose control of her sword.
 Yao Xi was not alone. Many cultivators present also possessed Intrinsic Flying Swords.
 This was especially true for the elders who had lived for hundreds or thousands of years. Their Intrinsic Flying Swords had been nurtured for their entire lives and were about to grow into their bodies.
 However, they were still unable to resist that terrifying will.
 In fact, due to the deep connection with their flying swords, even their divine sense was almost affected. And they were forced to follow their swords.
 It was clear that the sinister man’s realm in the Sword Dao and cultivation far surpassed theirs.
 “Is this the Sword God?” someone exclaimed.
 “No, this is the Sword Devil, the true Sword Devil!” an elder replied.
 They could sense the aura emitted by the evil man and the horrific demonic mind contained in his will
 Rumble rumble rumble rumble…
 Countless flying swords gathered in the air to form a giant metal vortex that stirred up space and shook violently.
 The mighty sword intent and sword might gathered by the tens of thousands of flying swords seemed capable of tearing apart the heavens and the earth.
 One could still sense the bone-chilling sword might even from a thousand feet away.
 Everyone retreated far away. Even though the swords had been snatched away, their lives were more important.
 It was clear that the evil man in front of them was someone they could not match.
 In fact, as long as he was willing, he could kill all of them with a wave of his hand.
 “Elder, what should we do?”
  “Let’s see what he wants to do. If he wants to start a massacre, we might be dead the moment he appears!”
 “This Sword Devil should be sealed in that Sword Mountain! We shouldn’t have pulled out those flying swords and provoked such a terrifying fellow!”
 “What should we do now!” Everyone was filled with regret.
 Not only had the flying sword they had just obtained from Sword Mountain been snatched away, but even their own flying sword had been taken away.
 It was a double loss.
 Most importantly, they had released the Sword Devil.
 This fellow had probably triggered a calamity in the Ancient Immortal Domain in the past.
 Furthermore, not many could deal with him.
 Otherwise, he should be dead and not sealed.
 If this Sword Devil really started a massacre, they would probably not escape death sooner or later even if they escaped from this place. It might even implicate the Immortal Martial World.
 “Damn it, I thought I could show off my might in front of this group of cultivators today! Why did such a guy suddenly appear to steal my limelight and even snatch my flying sword? This bastard!” The Blood Spirit Monarch felt stifled.
 It was not easy for him to enter the Immortal Spirit Realm. Before he could show off, he was ruined by this Sword Devil.
 At this moment, the evil man ignored the surrounding people, who were like ants to him.
 His wicked and cold gaze was still on a mountain peak not far from Sword Mountain. He slowly raised his right hand and formed a sword finger.
 Rumble!
 The world shook as the giant vortex formed by countless flying swords suddenly rushed into the sky. The sword lights condensed into a gigantic sword shadow that tore through the sky and swept away the clouds.
 In the next second, his raised right hand slashed down.
 Boom!
 The giant sword condensed from countless flying swords slashed down from the sky. The monstrous sword might tore through space as if splitting the heavens and the earth apart, instantly striking the mountain peak.
 In an instant, the towering mountain peak was flattened.
 The entire mountain turned into sand that blotted out the sky, carried away by the airwaves formed by the aftershocks of the sword might.
  After the dust dissipated, a majestic Immortal Palace appeared where the mountain had been.
 Four words were written on the plaque: Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode.
 The golden light screen enveloped the outside of the Immortal Palace and blocked the aftershock of the Sword Devil’s attack.
 At the moment, two figures stood by the Pan Emperor Immortal Palace’s entrance. They were Li Yu and Ji Qinglan, who had just exited the Immortal Palace.
 Ji Qinglan had just sensed that the Sword Devil sealed with his Life Soul in his previous life had broken out of the seal.
 He was the devil who had once brought calamity to the Ancient Immortal Domain and the Sword Sect.
 Now that he had broken out of the seal, the first person he would seek revenge on was Ji Qinglan himself.
 “Li! Cang! Lan!” The Sword Devil spat out three words. His voice was almost a roar, and every word seemed to contain dense killing intent.
Chapter 188 Eldest Senior Brother, I Miss You So Much (2)  Li Canglan was Ji Qinglan’s name in his previous life.
 Although he had reincarnated and his appearance had changed completely, his soul had not.
 The Sword Devil, who had been sealed away by Li Canglan’s soul power for countless years, could naturally sense it.
 He attacked because he sensed Li Canglan’s location nearby.
 “It’s Li Yu?” The cultivators watching from afar recognized Li Yu.
 Other than the cultivators who were not present at the Dao Seeking Tower previously and did not know Li Yu. Almost everyone knew Li Yu.
 After all, they were all present when Li Yu defeated Xin Ba in front of everyone and subdued the Dao Seeking Tower not long ago.
  Furthermore, even those who had never seen Li Yu before had more or less heard about the incident at the Dao Seeking Tower that day.
 Hence, when they heard someone mention Li Yu, they immediately sized up the two people in front of the Immortal Palace.
 In the end, their gazes stopped on Li Yu almost together.
 Both men carried long swords on their backs, and their appearances and auras were extraordinary.
 However, in comparison, Li Yu had an even more otherworldly appearance.
 He seemed to emit light all over his body. Even the brilliant Immortal Palace with its carved railings seemed dull beside him.
 “Li Yu is here too!” The Blood Spirit Monarch frowned slightly in surprise. On the other hand, many female disciples of the Divine Pool Holy Land had their eyes light up when they spotted Li Yu. “He’s Li Yu? He’s indeed extraordinary and handsome!”
 Although they had heard everything about Li Yu over the past few days, their eyes lit up when they saw him today. Their hearts were thumping wildly, and they even felt a little tempted.
 “No wonder people say that he’s even more extraordinary than Senior Brother Chu. He really lives up to his reputation!”
 “Senior Sister, he’s really handsome!”
 The few junior sisters beside Yao Xi discussed excitedly, and Yao Xi stared at Li Yu as her heart inexplicably beat faster.
 It was a reaction she had never had before, which surprised and puzzled her.
 Like many others, Yao Xi was indeed filled with admiration for Li Yu. After all, the Great Dao mantras enlightened her greatly and pointed the way for her cultivation.
 Therefore, when she found out that the person who spoke the mantra of the Great Dao was Li Yu, her admiration for him grew.
 Now that she saw Li Yu with her own eyes, she was indescribably excited, but she also felt inexplicably nervous. Such a complicated feeling left her at a loss. “Li Canglan? Could that Sword Devil be attacking Li Yu?”
 “From the looks of it, that Sword Devil clearly has a bloody feud with Li Canglan.”
 “Could Li Yu be from the Lingtian Mystic Realm in his previous life?”
 “It’s possible. This child is so extraordinary that he’s definitely not an ordinary person!”
 “Looks like Li Yu sealed the Sword Devil in Sword Mountain in the past!”
 Upon hearing the Sword Devil shouting a name, everyone instantly imagined various possibilities.
 “I wonder if Li Yu is a match for this Sword Devil!”
 “Sigh! It’s worrying!”
  Although everyone had seen how powerful Li Yu was, the shock and deterrence this Sword Devil gave them were clearly more substantial.
 That powerful sword intent could instantly seize control of everyone’s swords.
 It was as if the Sword God was commanding all the divine swords in the world.
 The sword might would arrive wherever his will reach.
 Furthermore, even if Li Yu might be on par with the Sword Devil in his previous life, he had clearly reincarnated. It was unknown if his strength had returned to its peak.
 Therefore, no one dared to say who was stronger between Li Yu and the Sword Devil.
 Ji Qinglan frowned, and a cold glint shot off from his eyes.
 However, he did not say anything. He was no longer a match for Sword Devil Ni Cang with his current capability. Anything he said was meaningless.
 Furthermore, the Sword Sect was no longer around, and this Ancient Immortal Domain had become a wasteland. All the grudges from his previous life had already become the past.
 However, it was clear that Sword Devil Ni Cang did not think that way. He only had killing intent and hatred in his heart.
 Rumble!
 Sword Devil Ni Cang’s aura kept rising, and killing intent surged in his eyes. He raised his right hand again, and countless flying swords flew over his head.
 It stirred up the color of the sky and the clouds.
 The terrifying sword intent seemed to transform into material energy that permeated the world.
 The immortal sword behind Ji Qinglan instantly left his body and flew up.
 Even the Pan Emperor’s Time Sword that he kept in his storage magic treasure and the flying sword from his previous life flew out.
 They gathered in the sword sea above the Sword Devil’s head.
 Upon seeing this, Ji Qinglan’s expression turned even uglier.
 After being sealed for countless years, the Sword Devil’s Sword Dao realm had actually improved significantly.
 Clearly, the Sword Devil Ni Cang in front of him was even stronger than in his previous life.
 His previous life might not be his match.
 Furthermore, his current cultivation level was not even a tenth of his previous life.
  “Hmm?”
 Sword Devil Ni Cang’s brows suddenly furrowed, and his cold gaze instantly switched to Li Yu and the sword on his back.
 That sword did not move at all, which surprised Ni Cang.
 “Is this the Sword Devil you encountered in your previous life?” Li Yu asked.
 “Hmm, Senior Brother, do you have a way to deal with him?” Ji Qinglan looked at Li Yu with anticipation.
 He was pleasantly surprised to see that Li Yu’s sword was not affected by the Sword Devil’s demonic will at all.
 When he recalled how Li Yu’s ordinary sword had become the top of the Divine Weapon Rankings, he felt that Li Yu’s sword was probably as extraordinary as Li Yu himself.
 Of course, he believed that Li Yu could deal with the Sword Devil.
Chapter 189 Eldest Senior Brother, I Miss You So Much (3)  Li Yu’s attainments in the Sword Dao have definitely reached the peak. As Elder Nie had mentioned, Li Yu was definitely a sword god.
 His attainments in the Sword Dao were far inferior to Li Yu in his previous life.
 Therefore, in his opinion, perhaps the karma from his previous life could finally conclude today.
 Li Yu gave no answer. Instead, he smiled confidently and pulled out the sword behind him.
 Sword Devil Ni Cang’s gaze focused on Li Yu as he reached out to grab the sword from Li Yu through the air.
 However, Li Yu’s sword still did not react like a phony sword.
 Everyone was shocked when they saw this, and a trace of anticipation ignited in their hearts. Perhaps Li Yu could show them a miracle.
  The Blood Spirit Monarch’s expression became complicated. He kept feeling that the scene in front of him was familiar.
 “Impossible!” Sword Devil Ni Cang looked at Li Yu’s sword, his eyes filled with confusion and surprise.
     

 That sword clearly felt like an ordinary sword, so why couldn’t he control it?
 How could he not control that sword with his Sword Dao realm and the Sword Devil’s will?
 He grabbed at the air again, but all he caught was loneliness. It frustrated the Sword Devil.
 He even felt shameful.
 “You want my sword?” Li Yu raised his sword and asked with a teasing look.
 Sword Devil Ni Cang frowned as his expression darkened. The flying sword above his head spun violently again.
 Immense sword intent erupted from the flying swords, condensing into monstrous sword might.
 “If you want it, take it!” Before Li Yu finished his sentence, the sword in his hand left his hand.
 Swoosh!
 The sword transformed into a stream of light that pierced through the Sword Devil’s chest at an unbelievable speed.
 It was so quick that no one present saw what had happened. Even Sword Devil Ni Cang did not react in time.
 Li Yu’s sword had already stabbed into the Sword Devil’s heart and penetrated his body.
 Sword Devil Ni Cang’s expression drastically changed as he looked down at his chest in shock at the sword he could not control.
     

 Immediately, the countless flying swords spinning above his head stopped moving. The sword lights flickered, and the condensed sword might instantly dissipated.
 “Look, you can’t even catch it if I give it to you. Sigh, how lousy!” Li Yu looked as if he expected better from the Sword Devil.
 Sword Devil Ni Cang’s body trembled as he held the sword in his chest with difficulty. His aura rapidly weakened.
 He looked at Li Yu and Ji Qinglan with reluctance and fear. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out.
 In the next second, he felt as if thousands of sharp swords had broken out of his body and torn his body apart.
 Everyone witnessed Sword Devil Ni Cang’s body split into pieces, and the tens of thousands of flying swords and the Sword Devil’s corpse fell together.
 All the human cultivators watching from afar were stunned.
 The shock in their hearts could not be any greater. For a moment, they were dazed. The Blood Spirit Monarch was naturally the most affected.
  He stared at Li Yu and the departed Sword Devil with his mouth agape as if he could see his fate unfolding.
 He was traumatized as he instantly recalled that familiar scene.
 He had also watched from afar and seen Li Yu kill the Crimson Dragon King with a single strike during that period. It was similar to today.
 A bone-chilling cold swept through the Blood Spirit Monarch’s body again, and he felt a lingering fear. Fortunately, he did not show off in front of Li Yu. Fortunately, he had encountered this Sword Devil before Li Yu.
 Otherwise, the person who would die under Li Yu’s sword would not be the Sword Devil but himself.
 Li Yu was too terrifying. He was someone he could never offend.
 While he was secretly shocked, the Blood Spirit Monarch suddenly sensed Li Yu’s gaze. His entire body instantly turned cold, and he almost knelt down.
 However, he suddenly had an idea. He instantly maximized his acting skills, revealing the look of a lost child who had finally found his home. He cried as he flew towards Li Yu and Ji Qinglan. “Eldest Senior Brother, I’ve finally found you. I’ve missed you so much!”
    
Chapter 190 Blood Spirit Monarch’s Desire to Live  The Blood Spirit Monarch’s exaggerated cries woke the surrounding cultivators up from their daze.
 When their gazes gathered on Li Yu again, they changed how they looked at him. Li Yu had really refreshed their understanding time and time again.
 When they thought that Li Yu’s power was already ridiculous, they had only seen the tip of the iceberg of Li Yu’s capability.
 Li Yu had just killed the Sword Devil with a single strike. It was clean, simple, and casual. It was enough to see how powerful he was.
 Furthermore, the Sword Devil could easily control all their flying swords, but Li Yu’s sword was the only exception.
 This meant that Li Yu’s Sword Dao realm was far above the Sword Devil.
 They could not imagine how high Li Yu’s level
  was.
 However, at this moment, everyone seemed to recall the word annotated on the Human Sons of Heaven Rankings-Unknown.
 When they thought of this word again, they seemed to have a new understanding of it.
 It did not seem to be the Heavenly Dao Rankings concealing Li Yu’s cultivation level, nor was it just Li Yu cultivating his own system.
 This ‘Unknown’ might mean that Li Yu’s cultivation might be so powerful that even the Heavenly Dao could not measure it. It was like endless outer space. The more they thought about it, the more afraid they were. Everyone recalled everything about Li Yu that they knew, and the shock in their hearts rose again.
 Not to mention those who saw Li Yu’s sword for the first time, even Ji Qinglan, who had known Li Yu for some time, was still shocked.
 Li Yu’s attainments in the Sword Dao had peaked, and no one could compare to him.
 To Li Yu, even without a sword, he could still unleash the most terrifying sword might, let alone a high-grade divine weapon. He could still split the sky with a single strike and kill immortals with a single strike.
 He was the true Sword God, a peerless Sword God!
 Indeed, Ji Qinglan was a Sword Dao expert in his previous life, and his cultivation level was far above Elder Nie in the first tier of the Nine Heavens Immortal Realm in the past.
     

 He also knew better than anyone else about the level of the Sword Devil.
 That was a terrifying existence that could stir up a calamity and fight an eternal faction alone.
 Now that many years had passed, the Sword Devil’s cultivation did not drop as it became stronger.
 In the past, Ji Canglan would probably have been killed before he could use the forbidden technique. His Sword Sect would probably get annihilated.
 Yet, such a powerful being was still as weak as an ant before Li Yu, who could kill the Sword Devil without any effort.
 This was a little terrifying. Li Yu’s strength was unfathomable, and it refreshed Ji Qinglan’s understanding again. “Eldest Senior Brother, Thirteenth Brother, I’ve finally found you. I’ve missed all of you so much!” The Blood Spirit Monarch rushed in front of Li Yu and Ji Qinglan without any shame, his face covered in tears and snot.
 However, Li Yu remained unmoved. Although Ji Qinglan was happy to see Ji Wanjie return, he did not dare to speak when he saw Li Yu’s dark face.
 After all, Ji Wanjie had decided to leave the group suddenly. If he could not give a reasonable explanation, Li Yu would definitely not forgive him.
 “Qinglan, collect those swords from your Sword Sect. Don’t take anything below immortal artifacts!” Li Yu ordered Ji Qinglan.
 He did not want to waste his spoils of war.
 After all, it was beneficial to bring back so many immortal artifacts for his junior brothers to use.
 Everyone in the sect would have an immortal sword in the future. The sect could even organize a recruiting event where new disciples would be given an immortal sword when they entered the sect. Those with outstanding talent would be given a Dao Artifact.
 It could probably blow up the entire Immortal Martial World.
 “Tell me, what happened?” Li Yu clenched his fists and asked in a deep voice.
 The Blood Spirit Monarch panicked inside. He felt that everything would be over if he did not give a valid explanation.
 His desire to survive made his imagination run wild, and he fabricated a new story.
 “When I was passing through the teleportation array, I suddenly felt controlled by an unknown will. After that, I didn’t know anything. When I woke up, I realized that I was in an immortal abode.
 “I was in a strange blood refinement totem. Later on, I found out that it was the Blood Ancestor’s immortal abode, and the person controlling my will was the remnant soul of the Blood Ancestor.
 “He wanted to possess my body. At that time, I really thought that I would never see my Eldest Senior Brother or my thirteenth brother and my fellow brothers again!
 “Fortunately, my Demonic Blood Body’s backlash, coupled with the blessings that my Eldest Senior Brother’s Merit Golden Body gave me, helped to destroy the remnant soul of the Blood Ancestor with lightning. It allowed me to successfully devour the remnant soul of the Blood Ancestor in the end. I even obtained the inheritance in his immortal abode and entered the Immortal Spirit Realm…
 The Blood Spirit Monarch spoke with sincerity and certainty.
     

 After all, most of what he said was the truth. Indeed, he was almost possessed by the Blood Ancestor, so his lies sounded real.
 Coupled with his superb acting skills stimulated by his desire to live, no one could see any flaws.
 Of course, if Li Yu did not have the system, it would be difficult to find any flaws.
 However, Li Yu had the system. He had previously seen the rough trajectory of Ji Wanjie’s movements. After entering the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm, Ji Wanjie did not appear in the Blood Ancestor’s immortal abode as he had claimed.
 Therefore, Li Yu only believed half of Ji Wanjie’s words.
 However, he could not be bothered to get to the bottom of it, nor was he in a hurry to understand everything. Moreover, he could not bear to see him cry.
 Furthermore, many people were watching.
 Thus, he waved his hand and said, “If there’s a next time, I won’t let you off!”
 Hearing Li Yu’s words, the Blood Spirit Monarch heaved a sigh of relief. He had escaped a calamity.
 The Blood Spirit Monarch had also thought it through. If his identity as the Blood Spirit Monarch was exposed in the future, he would kneel and beg for mercy, becoming a servant like Wu Chang.
 After all, he did not have any deep enmity with Li Yu.
 Li Yu should not have to reach that point to kill him.
 As for the matter of him possessing Ji Wanjie, he had already thought of an excuse. In any case, he could not escape from Li Yu.
 Instead of dying now, it was better to perform well and establish a deep relationship with Li Yu and his fellow disciples.
 He could also fight for some hope of survival in the future.
 Sigh…
  I had finally stepped into the immortal level after a narrow escape.
 Yet, I’m still living such a cowardly life. I have fallen into Li Yu’s hands and got myself completely controlled by him.
 When the cultivators in the distance saw that Ji Wanjie was actually from the Qingyun Sect, they suddenly felt relieved.
 It did not seem that surprising for someone from the Qingyun Sect to enter the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 After everyone found their stolen flying swords, they gathered towards Li Yu. After sizing up the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode, their gazes landed on Li Yu.
 “Thank you, Immortal Master, for eradicating this calamity for the world and recovering our flying swords!” Everyone cupped their fists in gratitude.
 After all, if not for Li Yu, they would probably have caused a major disaster today.
 Li Yu remained silent. He only cupped his hands to everyone and nodded with a smile in response.
    
Chapter 191 Prince Charming Becomes a Bootlicker  “Indeed, in the years I’ve been away, unbelievable things have happened in the Immortal Martial World. There are already so many Immortal Spirit Realm cultivators!
 “What kind of sect is the Qingyun Sect? It’s incredible. The top five are all from their sect, and they’ve all stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm. What’s with that unknown cultivation level too?”
 After returning to the Immortal Martial World, Dao Yanzi was shocked by the information on the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 Before he ascended to the Immortal Domain, it was already not easy for the Immortal Martial World to produce an Immortal Spirit Realm cultivator every hundred years.
 However, there were already many Immortal Spirit Realm cultivators in the younger generation. Apart from the Qingyun Sect, the demon race had also produced two Immortal Spirit Realm cultivators.
 And this was only the younger generation on the Sons of Heaven Rankings. How many cultivators in the Immortal Spirit Realm were not on the rankings? Furthermore, the cultivation levels of the other geniuses on the rankings were also shocking. Many had already stepped into the Mahayana Realm and were half a step into the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 Times have changed!
  Dao Yanzi sighed.
 He guessed that it might be related to the appearance of the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 Even so, it was still shocking.
 But then again, since the human race had so many Immortal Spirit Realm cultivators, how could the demon races be so arrogant?
 Dao Yanzi was even more puzzled, so he immediately arranged for everyone to split up and investigate. Soon, they learned about the Immortal Martial World and the various Holy Lands.
 It also confirmed that they were in the Huaxia continent.
 The Immortal Spirit Realm elites on the rankings and the top human experts were all in the mystic realm and could not come out for the time being.
 As for the Primordial Dao Holy Land, the Divine Firmament Holy Land, the Violet Palace Holy Land, the Divine Pool Holy Land, the Grand Primordium Holy Land, and the Million Swords Holy Land. They had already been occupied by the demons.
 A few days ago, an ancestor of the Primordial Dao Holy Land who had been in seclusion for five hundred years successfully stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm and returned.
 He turned the tide and drove off the demons who occupied the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 It was a pity that the next day, that ancestor of the Primordial Dao Holy Land was severely injured by the expert named Young Master Qing Ye, and his fate was unknown.
 The Primordial Dao Holy Land was soon occupied by the demons again.
 Only the Clear Void Holy Land of the Huaxia continent was left among the seven Holy Lands. The humans in the entire Jingxing Realm were in a state of panic.
     

 The remaining Clear Void Holy Land was also on the brink of death. Everyone was in danger, and the demons’ next target must be the Clear Void Holy Land.
 If the Clear Void Holy Land was also occupied, the human cultivators might be trapped in the Lingtian Mystic Realm forever.
 There were many rumors about Young Master Qing Ye, and Dao Yanzi could not determine who he was or his cultivation level through the information he received.
 Dao Yanzi could only meet him personally to find out. Hence, he decided to save the Primordial Dao Holy Land and force Young Master Qing Ye out.
 “When the time comes, you guys can stay hidden in the dark. There’s no need to attack. I’ll investigate Young Master Qing Ye’s capability. If I’m not his match, you guys may return to the Immortal Domain and ask for the help of the immortal sects!” said Dao Yanzi.
 Although he felt that Young Master Qing Ye was, at most, on par with him, he could not let his guard down for safety reasons.
 After all, he could not joke about his two disciple-nephews’ lives.
 “Understood, Uncle-Master!” Lu Yuchen and the others nodded.
 “Why isn’t Yu Fan back yet? Zi Liang, go look for Yu Fan!” Dao Yanzi ordered a disciple beside him.
 “Yes, sir!” the man named Zi Liang replied. His figure flashed and disappeared on the spot. After a while, Zi Liang returned with a token in his hand. He reported with a worried expression, “Deputy Hall Master, something bad has happened to Senior Brother Lu!”
 Dao Yanzi’s expression changed as he hurriedly questioned for details.
 It turned out that Zi Liang had found Lu Yufan’s location through the communication token they carried with them. He soon realized that it had been left on the ground, and Lu Yufan had already disappeared.
 There were no signs of a fight at the scene, nor did anyone nearby hear anything.
 “Uncle-Master, don’t worry. Yu Fan must have gone for a break!” Lu Yuchen knew his second brother very well and knew that he had followed his uncle-master to the lower realm to play.
 Therefore, he guessed that Yu Fan must have deliberately thrown away the communication token.
 “Sigh, my second brother is really unreliable! Uncle-Master, don’t worry about him for now. Let’s recover the Primordial Dao Holy Land first.”
 “Hmm, alright!” Dao Yanzi was helpless as well. However, he believed that Lu Yufan should not be in any danger, so he decided to let him off for the time being.
 Meanwhile, Lu Li had been enjoying the delicacies in the Heavenly Fate Dynasty’s capital.
 Lu Li was worried that her father would chase after her and capture her if he knew that she had secretly descended into the mortal world.
 Hence, she took the opportunity to slip away while she was sent to gather information.
 After all, she had descended to play.
 As for Uncle-Master Dao Yan’s mission, she believed that it would not be a problem with the help of her older brother and those immortal sect disciples.
 Furthermore, Lu Yufan would probably come down to the mortal world with his father to find her. At that time, they would definitely meet up with Uncle-Master Dao Yan and the rest.
     

 In short, she would just enjoy her free time.
 “Hmm, I didn’t expect the food in the lower realm to taste so good!” Lu Li ate the delicacies happily while looking at the Heavenly Dao Rankings in the sky.
 Her gaze was attracted by the first on the Human Sons of Heaven Rankings, Li Yu.
 “Cultivation is unknown?” Lu Li was curious. She had seen the Sons of Heaven Rankings in the Immortal Domain.
 However, even the prodigies of the Immortal Domain were not like Li Yu, whose cultivation level was unknown.
 “This Qingyun Sect seem interesting?” Lu Li was curious.
 After completing the mission for the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode in the Lingtian Mystic Realm, Li Yu brought Ji Qinglan and Ji Wanjie back to the Misty Immortal Island.
 He also learned that Tang Chi had successfully entered the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 “Even Tang Chi has entered the Immortal Spirit Realm?” The Blood Spirit Monarch’s mentality was on the brink of explosion.
 He had risked his life to exchange for that opportunity to enter the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 In the end, everyone from the Qingyun Sect had already become immortal.
 Even Su Mu, Lu Yuming, Meng Xueqi, and a few other young disciples who entered the sect later were about to reach the Tribulation realm.
 His Immortal Spirit Realm cultivation instantly seemed worthless.
 When the Blood Spirit Monarch found out how they had entered the Immortal Spirit Realm so quickly, his mentality was really about to collapse.
 Compared to Li Yu’s opportunities and luck, his own were simply dregs.
 Recalling his experience of becoming an Immortal, he felt he had asked for suffering. If he had followed Li Yu from the beginning, he could have easily stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm without any effort.
 Moreover, Ji Qinglan, Ye Qiu, Gu Yuqi, and Tang Chi had not only stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm, but they had also obtained the Paragon Bones and the blood essence of divine beasts.
 Now, their power levels were above his completely.
 After a long detour, he had become the last among them.
  “Master, you’re back. I’ve already trained your new mount for you!” General Guo ran over excitedly.
 As for Xin Ba following the Qilin, he rushed in front of Li Yu and crawled to his feet. He shook his head and wagged his tail while grinning foolishly like a pug. “Welcome, Master!”
 Li Yu looked at General Guo in surprise.
 Before he left, Xin Ba was still a proud prince charming. Why did he become a bootlicker after only two days?
 What has Xin Ba gone through?
 Seeing Li Yu’s surprised gape, General Guo was pleased with himself. Then, he shouted, “What’s our slogan?”
 Xin Ba immediately put on a solemn expression as he stood up and yelled at the top of his lungs, “I must follow Master whenever he goes out. I must obey my Master’s orders. I must follow Master blindly even when he says something wrong!
 “I have to tolerate beating and scolding. I have to understand my Master’s intentions. I can part with dignity. I can bear to part with my life!”
    
Chapter 192 Join If You Can’t Beat Them (1)  Is this the pet version of Three Obediences and Four Virtues?
 Li Yu gave General Guo a thumbs up. This guy was simply a talent!
 Li Yu thought about how he could tame the unruly Xin Ba into submission in just two days.
 was
 It had to be said that General Guo was really something
 At that moment, Xin Ba really wanted to find a hole in the ground to hide in.
 General Guo was even more of a devil than Li Yu. Who knew what he had experienced in the past two days?
  “Mm, not bad. General Guo, from now on, Xin Ba will be under your charge!” Li Yu patted General Guo’s shoulder and smiled.
 “Yes, Master. I will definitely train Xin Ba to be better!”
 Thud!
 Xin Ba fainted on the spot!
 The Blood Spirit Monarch walked around the Misty Immortal Island under Ji Qinglan’s lead. It was an eye-opener.
 “Young Master, the tea is ready!” A flower fairy brought the brewed tea to the pavilion.
 “Come, Ninth Brother, have some Dao Comprehension Tea!” Ji Qinglan poured a cup of tea for the Blood Spirit Monarch.
 The fragrance of tea spread in all directions, and it was filled with immortal energy. There seemed to be a Dao rune phenomenon faintly discernible in the steam, and it was exceptional.
 The Blood Spirit Monarch took a sip of the Dao Comprehension Tea and could not help but sigh. It was good to be home.
 The next day, in the Immortal Martial World’s Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 Dao Yanzi had once again repelled the demons guarding the Primordial Dao Holy Land by himself.
     

 He regained control of the Holy Land and released the captured disciples of the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 Meanwhile, he stayed in the Holy Land alone and waited for Young Master Qing Ye’s arrival.
 “What do these demons want?” Dao Yanzi examined the newly built giant altar in the Holy Land with surprise.
 Clearly, this group of demons did not just want to occupy the Holy Land. They seemed to be plotting something.
 This made him even more curious about who Young Master Qing Ye was and his ultimate motive.
 Initially, he only thought that Young Master Qing Ye was an expert from a demon race in the Immortal Domain and wanted to establish his own faction in the lower realm.
 However, it did not seem that simple.
 While Dao Yanzi and the others were at the Primordial Dao Holy Land, Lu Li arrived at the Great Xia Dynasty.
 She was curious when she saw Li Yu and the Qingyun Sect on the Heavenly Dao Rankings in the Heavenly Fate Dynasty.
 He asked about the Qingyun Sect and Li Yu from the people in the city and heard many legendary stories.
 It piqued her interest, so she asked around and finally arrived at the Great Xia Dynasty.
 However, she was shocked when she saw the Great Xia Dynasty’s Physique Rankings.
 Human body?
  The strongest physique on the Heavenly Physique Rankings came from here?
 The owner of this physique was actually Li Yu.
 I knew there would be a surprise here!
 Lu Li was thrilled.
 She felt she had solved an unsolved mystery that baffled everyone in the Immortal Domain.
 It was as if she had found a treasure.
 Although she knew that Li Yu was not in the Qingyun Sect now, she felt that she should be able to figure out what kind of physique Li Yu possessed here.
 “Uncle, may I ask if you know where the Qingyun Sect is?” Lu Li asked an old man passing by.
     

 As Lu Li asked for directions, the Genius Excellence Rankings in the sky announced today’s name on the rankings.
 Excellence Rankings # 18: Feng Xian
 Identity: Feng Family disciple
 Origin: Feng Family
 The moment the rankings appeared, the surrounding people looked at the sky and discussed animatedly.
 They were familiar with this name. He was once ranked fifth on the Human Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 Furthermore, he was the person with the fastest cultivation improvement besides the Qingyun Sect disciples on the Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 Although his ranking kept falling previously because the Qingyun Sect continuously overtook him, his cultivation had stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm last night.
 His ranking even surpassed Ji Qinglan, Gu Yuqi, and Tang Chi of the Qingyun Sect to reach third place.
 This instantly made him the center of attention.
 At the moment, Feng Xian had just walked out of the Ancient Divine Azure Dragon Kingdom ruins of the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 He had already been reborn, and his appearance and aura had undergone a tremendous change.
 He originally had an ordinary appearance, but now he exudes an extraordinary heroic aura. This was credited to the wealth and treasures he had accumulated in his previous life.
 After Feng Xian arrived in the Lingtian Mystic Realm, he realized that this was his home in his previous life.
 Especially after he found the ruins of the Ancient Divine Azure Dragon Kingdom’s palace. He was even more certain of it.
 He did not expect that in a few years after his death, the entire Lingtian Immortal Domain would be invaded by the Devil Immortals, plus a series of strange events and calamities.
  In the end, space collapsed, and Lingtian became a wasteland.
 The space here had become extremely unstable, and some of it even overlapped with the Immortal Martial World.
 As for the various signs in the ruins of the Ancient Kingdom’s palace, it was as if the citizens here had suddenly evaporated. Many things were untouched, especially some treasures.
 He could not understand it. He did not even know where the people from the Lingtian Immortal Domain went after that. He did not know if they were dead or alive or if his people and country still existed.
 Everything was unknown, and he could only wait and look for the answer.
 However, he had gained a lot from his palace this time. Not only did he obtain the bloodline from his previous life, but he also fused four saint bones and one paragon bone.
 He had even obtained the blood soul of an Ancestral Demon, allowing his cultivation to soar into the sky and surpass his previous life.
 It was only a matter of time before he returned to the peak with the many treasures and opportunities his home from the previous life had accumulated.
    
Chapter 193 Join If You Can’t Beat Them (2)  “It’s time to leave!” Looking at his former home, Feng Xian had mixed feelings.
 Ever since he entered the Lingtian Mystic Realm, he had stayed here. It was time to leave in search of new opportunities.
 After leaving the Ancient Divine Azure Dragon Kingdom ruins, Feng Xian flew towards the zone he knew he might encounter opportunities.
 After all, with his memory of his previous life, he knew the locations of the various large factions better than anyone else.
 Even though the space and geographical environment of the Lingtian Immortal Domain, now known as Lingtian Mystic Realm, had undergone a bizarre change, he could still find those ruins based on various clues.
 As he had expected, it did not take long for Feng Xian to discover the familiar environment.
 “That’s Sword Mountain. It should be the Sword Sect!” Feng Xian immediately flew over.
  However, when he arrived at the ruins of the Sword Sect, he saw an Immortal Palace near Sword Mountain.
 “Mi Lu Immortal Palace? What is it doing over here?” Feng Xian was slightly surprised. He had knowledge about the Mi Lu Immortal Palace.
 He was even familiar with Great Immortal Mi Lu.
 Regardless, compared to the other strange events in the Immortal Domain, this was nothing too odd at the moment.
 Therefore, he did not think much about it and went straight to the Immortal Palace. “The Misty Immortal Island of Great Immortal Mi Lu had many fortunes in the past!” Feng Xian was tempted. Since he had encountered the Mi Lu Immortal Palace, he could not waste such a great opportunity. Furthermore, he was an expert in array formations and was once an array formation master of the Lingtian Immortal Domain.
     

 It could be said that no one in the entire Immortal Domain could surpass him in terms of array formations, restrictions, talismans, and related aspects.
 Many array formations he had once created were still applied by the various large factions.
 Therefore, he was confident that he could crack most array formations in the world.
 “If I can obtain the legendary Qimen Dunjia Disc, I can definitely break through all the array formations in this world with ease!” Feng Xian thought of the most coveted treasure in his previous life.
 The Nine Heavens Dark Lady’s Qimen Dunjia Disc was the ancestor of array formations. It was like the source of the Great Dao. With it, one could grasp the origin and rules of the array formation. It could create more and stronger array formations and crack all array formations.
 As he was thinking, Feng Xian began his attempt to crack the protective array formation outside the Mi Lu Immortal Palace.
 He took out pillars filled with runes from his storage magic treasure and arranged them around the Mi Lu Immortal Palace. Then, he shot out talismans that fused into the pillars.
 Those pillars immediately emitted golden lights that shot into the light screen of the Immortal Palace’s defensive array formation. Immediately, they collided intensely as if water and fire were clashing.
 At the same time, Feng Xian took out a bronze compass and began attempting to break the array formation.
 However, the Mi Lu Immortal Palace’s array formation was exceptionally high level, and its complexity was not something ordinary array formations could compare with. Thus, it was difficult to break it.
 Feng Xian held the bronze compass and circled the Immortal Palace. At times, he frowned and pondered for a long time.
  He would occasionally size it up and examine it from left to right.
 Soon, he simply sat on the ground holding his chin in his left hand and the compass in his right while he kept frowning.
 However, after some observation, research, and deduction, Feng Xian seemed to have found a breakthrough point. He was immediately overjoyed and jumped up from the ground again.
 He began to control the pillars to constantly change the frequency of the golden light, bombarding the Immortal Palace’s defensive array formation.
 On top of that, Feng Xian spun the compass and sent out runes that fused into the golden light while he deduced the operation patterns of the array formation.
     

 After about two hours, Feng Xian’s eyes lit up. He quickly corrected the compass and kept forming hand seals to control the frequency of the golden light on the pillars.
 And in the end, the golden light slowly fused with the light screen of the Immortal Palace’s array formation. The originally incompatible collision became harmonious.
 “It worked!” Feng Xian was overjoyed. He immediately formed hand seals and shot out a few more talismans that entered the pillar.
 Immediately, his hand seals switched. The fluctuations of the defensive array formation light screen suddenly stopped before dissipating
 Right at this moment, a cold voice suddenly sounded from behind. “What are you doing?”
 The owner of this voice was none other than Li Yu.
 Not long ago, he left the Misty Immortal Island with Ji Qinglan and entered the underground ruins of the Sword Sect to collect the other treasures left behind by the Sword Sect.
 He did not expect to encounter such a strange fellow who actually managed to break through his Immortal Palace’s array formation.
 Just as Feng Xian turned around, an introduction page of this person popped up in front of Li Yu.
 Hey, another fated person with some background.
 Feng Xian frowned and looked at Li Yu carefully. His appearance and bearing were otherworldly. Even in the Immortal Domain, not many could compare to this person.
  He was clearly a prodigy of the human race, but Feng Xian did not know him.
 “Hmph, it’s none of your business!” Feng Xian retracted his gaze and was about to walk toward the Immortal Palace.
 “You destroyed my Immortal Palace’s array formation, and you’re saying that’s none of my business!?” Li Yu’s figure zoomed past and instantly blocked Feng Xian.
 According to the system’s introduction, this person was a peerless genius in array formations.
 It was proven true. Feng Xian had actually broken through the defensive array formation of the Mi Lu Immortal Palace, which was ridiculous enough.
 However, Li Yu understood that Feng Xian treated the Mi Lu Immortal Palace as ownerless property.
 “Hmph, your Immortal Palace? Are you kidding me? Can’t you see? This is Great Immortal Mi Lu’s Immortal Palace. Kid, if you want to snatch this fortune, you have to rely on your own strength. It’s not something you can do just by opening your mouth!” Feng Xian sneered.
 In his opinion, Li Yu was here to freeload on opportunities, but this trick was a little poor.
    
Chapter 194 Join If You Can’t Beat Them (3)  “Mm, you’re right!” Li Yu nodded. He felt that Feng Xian’s suggestion made sense, so he rolled up his sleeves and gave Feng Xian a good beating.
 Feng Xian lay on the ground with a swollen face, looking at the sky in disbelief.
 It was as if he did not know what had just happened.
 Everything happened so quickly, and he was already on the ground before he could react.
 This guy is terrifying!
 “Am I strong enough?” Li Yu squatted on Feng Xian’s face and asked with a smile.
 The corners of Feng Xian’s mouth twitched. He had finally encountered an opponent today. The Immortal Palace that he had painstakingly broken through was probably going to be seized by this fellow.
  “Enough!” Feng Xian squeezed out the word unwillingly.
     

 Mainly, he did not want to die. This person was clearly not someone he could provoke.
 A man had to be flexible.
 “Wait a minute!” Li Yu suddenly changed the topic. “I was f*cking tricked by you. I’m not here to snatch opportunities from you. Why should I ask if I’m not strong enough!”
 Feng Xian was quite surprised to hear that.
 Not here to snatch opportunities? Then what are you here for?
 “If you’re interested in this Immortal Palace, we can enter together. I’m proficient in array formations, so I might be able to help you break through various restrictions and arrays!” Feng Xian proposed.
 “I’ve already said that this is my Immortal Palace. This Mi Lu Immortal Palace has already recognized me as its master!” Li Yu explained.
 Feng Xian got up from the ground and cupped his hands. “Sorry to disturb you!”
 After saying that, he wanted to leave, but he was stopped by Li Yu again. “You think you can leave after breaking my Immortal Palace’s defensive array formation?”
 “I can help you recover it again!” Feng Xian hurriedly replied.
 From the sound of this, the Mi Lu Immortal Palace does seem to recognize this kid as its master.
 “Then hurry up and do it!” ordered Li Yu.
     

 Feng Xian hurriedly brought out the compass and the pillars. He formed hand seals and sent out talismans. Soon, the defensive array formation condensed again.
 “It’s done. It’s exactly the same as before. If you don’t believe me, you can give it a try!” Feng Xian reported.
 Li Yu walked closer and realized that the array formation could be controlled. It was no different from before.
 “No problem, right? I can leave now, right?” Seeing that Li Yu could control the array formation, he confirmed that Li Yu was indeed the new master of the Immortal Palace.
 It had to be said that this kid’s luck was too good.
 “There’s a problem!” replied Li Yu.
 “That’s impossible!” Feng Xian was a little surprised. He had clearly helped him recover the array formation, so how could there be a problem?
  Li Yu frowned and looked at Feng Xian. “You can crack the array formation of my Immortal Palace and recover it at will. How is there no problem with that?”
 It was like there was someone who could unlock his door at will. How could he let this person go if he could not change that lock?
 Feng Xian was speechless for a moment. What Li Yu said seemed to make sense.
 Oh no, is this guy thinking of silencing me?
 Considering his capability, I’ll never escape death even if I use everything I have.
 He sensed Li Yu’s deep gaze on him.
 Feng Xian suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He instinctively took a step back as his desire to live surged.
 An idea flashed through his mind. He immediately knelt on one knee and cupped his hands. “I’m willing to obey you forever and follow your lead. I have no ulterior motives. I can even swear to the heavens that I’m proficient in the Dao of array formations, and I’m best at setting up array formations and breaking formations. I can save you a lot of trouble in this Immortal Domain. Furthermore, I can help you set up a better array formation for this Immortal Palace!”
    
Chapter 195 A Sense of Belonging (1)  Forsaken Immortal Realm, Primordial Dao Immortal Sect.
 On Zi Qing Peak, Lu Fanchen was about to bring Lu Yufan to have a few elders to help send them to the lower realm.
 Suddenly, three men flew over from afar and arrived in front of Lu Fanchen. The handsome man in the lead, wearing a bamboo leaf-patterned Daoist robe, cupped his hands slightly. “Greetings, Uncle-Master Lu! My master has sent my junior nephew over to invite Uncle-Master to meet up at the Grand Peace Palace!”
 The person who spoke was called Guo Shengxiu, one of the five orders of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect.
 As the sect master’s personal disciple, he was a young prodigy with a Perfected Immortal cultivation level. He was not much weaker than Lu Fanchen.
 “Oh no, I forgot about this. I’m supposed to accompany the sect master today. Sigh!” Lu Fanchen hammered his fist.
 “Dad, I’ll go by myself then. I’ll definitely bring my sister back safely!” Lu Yufan promised.
  “Did something happen to Little Li?” Guo Shengxiu’s expression changed as he asked worriedly.
 Everyone in the sect knew that he had a crush on Lu Li, and Lu Fanchen was also satisfied with Guo Shengxiu.
 It was just that Lu Li had always been lukewarm towards Guo Shengxiu. However, Lu Li was still young and playful, so this matter could not be rushed.
 “This girl secretly followed your Uncle-Master Dao Yan to the lower realm…” Lu Fanchen told Guo Shengxiu everything.
 “Your Uncle-Master Dao Yan can protect Lu Li’s safety, but I’m worried that he can’t keep an eye on this girl at all. I’m guessing that she has already run off alone by now!” Lu Fanchen said helplessly.
 He knew his daughter’s personality too well. She was eccentric and scheming. Dao Yanzi and Lu Yuchen could not deal with her.
     

 However, he had something on and could not go down. He was even more worried about leaving it to Lu Yufan. This kid was even more unreliable than Lu Li.
 If Yu Fan went down to the mortal world himself, both siblings would surely disappear.
 “I see. Uncle-Master, don’t worry. I’ll help you find Junior Sister Lu in the lower realm! I’ll bring her back safely!” Guo Shengxiu replied sincerely.
 He felt that this was his best opportunity to develop a relationship with Junior Sister Lu Li. How could he miss it?
 Furthermore, with the contrast between the mortals in the lower realm, he would definitely appear more extraordinary and dazzling.
 His junior sister would be able to see his strengths by that time.
 It would be even better if Lu Li could encounter some danger. If Guo Shengxiu seized the opportunity to save the damsel in distress, he might grab his junior sister’s heart.
 “That’s great. Then I’ll leave this matter to you. Go find Elder Chen and the others immediately and get them to send you to the Jingxing Realm,” Lu Fanchen requested happily.
 Compared to his unreliable son, he was more willing to believe in Guo Shengxiu. He would be more at ease if Guo Shengxiu went to the lower realm to find Lu Li.
 “Senior Brother Guo, let’s go!” Lu Yufan said.
 “You don’t have to go down. Shengxiu is capable enough!” Lu Fanchen was afraid that Lu Yufan would cause trouble without him around.
 “Dad, didn’t you ask me to go down and train with Uncle-Master? Why…” Lu Yufan panicked. His plan to go to the lower realm was going down the drain!
 “Stay here and wait for the news. If they need help, I’ll naturally send you down. Until your sister returns, you’ll stay in the sect obediently, understand?” Lu Fanchen ordered seriously.
 He placed some blame on Lu Yufan for Lu Li’s sneaking into the lower realm. He even suspected that Lu Yufan showing off to Lu Li had sparked her desire to enter the lower realm.
 “Dad, please, no!” Lu Yufan complained endlessly in his heart.
 “It’s settled then!” Lu Fanchen asserted firmly. He looked at Guo Shengxiu. “Disciple-Nephew, I’ll leave this to you!”
     

 “Uncle-Master, you’re too kind. This is my duty. I’m willing to do anything for Junior Sister Lu!” Guo Shengxiu cupped his hands. “Uncle-Master, I’ll make preparations immediately and enter the lower realm to find Junior Sister Lu!”
 “Good!”
 Lingtian Mystic Realm, outside the Mi Lu Immortal Palace.
 Li Yu was also surprised to see Feng Xian kneel on one knee to express his loyalty. He did not expect this reincarnated Immortal Emperor to have such a strong desire to live.
 I didn’t even say anything to threaten him, and he took the initiative to submit. At least you used to be an Immortal Emperor. Can’t you have some backbone?
 At least submit after I beat you up a dozen more times.
 How could Li Yu know how strong the desire to stay alive was for someone who had already died once?
 Furthermore, if not for the fact that Feng Xian was a talent who was valuable to him, he could not spare this person’s life.
 “Follow me? Hmm, I can consider it!” Li Yu nodded slightly.
 As Feng Xian had mentioned, someone proficient in array formations was indeed valuable to him.
 Feng Xian could set up various powerful array formations for the sect in the future.
  Furthermore, Feng Xian was an extraordinary person. Not to mention his strength and potential. The wealth in his brain was probably not inferior to Ji Qinglan.
 They could become the pillars of the Qingyun Sect in the future.
 Feng Xian heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Li Yu’s response. Although his actions earlier were spineless, he still averted the danger.
 That was a close call!
 However, if not for his poor background and experience in this life, being used to compromise and endure hardships. He would probably never be able to lower his head to Li Yu in his previous life.
 However, Feng Xian did not know that his conversation with Li Yu had been exposed by the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 Countless people watching the rankings in the Immortal Martial World were at a loss whether to laugh or cry.
 What kind of curse is this? Does it mean that anyone not from the Qingyun Sect and those in the Immortal Spirit Realm can’t escape the fate of being dealt with by Li Yu?
    
Chapter 196 Found a Sense of Belonging (2)  Previously, there was Long Yue and Xin Ba. Now, this human prodigy had fallen into Li Yu’s hands.
 However, compared to Long Yue and Xin Ba, Feng Xian’s outcome was not as bad.
 Of course, many people did not find Feng Xian embarrassing. Instead, they believed that he had encountered a great opportunity.
 This was a chance that many people could only dream of.
 Li Yu was clearly extraordinary. Although he had never appeared on the Excellence Rankings at this stage, his stunning achievements had never been absent.
 Furthermore, his legend was written on the Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 With his lead, many disciples of the Qingyun Sect entered the Immortal Spirit Realm in succession in just one month.
  Some disciples who did not appear on the Sons of Heaven Rankings at the start also improved at a terrifying speed, and their rankings rose steadily.
 This was especially true for Tang Chi, who did not start on the rankings. Now that he had also ascended to become immortal, it was impossible not to be shocked.
 Everyone knew that this was the luck and opportunity Li Yu had brought to everyone.
 However, no matter what, Li Yu was still an existence far ahead that no one could surpass.
 Therefore, if Feng Xian followed Li Yu. He would definitely be able to obtain more fortunes and improve his cultivation.
 In the Lingtian Mystic Realm. After Feng Xian expressed his willingness to follow Li Yu, a golden light suddenly fused into his body.
 It was the reward from the Genius Excellence Rankings. Feng Xian had seen the appearance of the Genius Excellence Rankings before entering the Lingtian Mystic Realm, so he knew what was going on.
 Feng Xian felt a headache when he thought about how his experience might be broadcasted by the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 However, he did not have any burden and did not care about how others viewed him. Furthermore, he did not take the people from the Immortal Martial World seriously.
 Why would he care what they thought of him?
 “You can follow me, but you have to show sincerity!” Li Yu suddenly added.
 “What do you want me to do?” Feng Xian’s heart sank again.
 “The Ancient Divine Azure Dragon Kingdom should have a lot of wealth, right? Immortal Emperor Xian Yun?” Li Yu revealed a refined and easygoing smile.
 eve
 Feng Xian’s expression changed, and his eyes revealed shock. “Who are you?”
 He suddenly had a creepy feeling, as if the person in front of him could see through him.
 How did he know my identity?
     

 Even if he is the reincarnation of a mighty figure from the Immortal Domain, he should not know the secret of my identity from my previous life.
 Did he guess my identity through some clues on me? But apart from displaying my talent in array formations, I don’t seem to have exposed much information.
 It’s impossible for him to deduce my identity based on this alone. That is too horrifying!
 “You’re Immortal Emperor Xian Yun of the Ancient Divine Azure Dragon Kingdom?” Ji Qinglan looked at Feng Xian in surprise.
 He knew the Immortal Emperor Xian Yun. They were not close friends, but they were old acquaintances.
 The main reason was that times had changed. To be able to meet someone from the Immortal Domain again, he naturally felt the joy of meeting an old friend in a foreign land.
 Feng Xian also looked at Ji Qinglan in surprise. It seemed that Ji Qinglan knew him, judging from his reaction.
 Feng Xian also recalled a stunning sword immortal whose name shook the Immortal Domain in his previous life.
 After relating to the Sword Sect ruins here, he supposed his guess was not far off.
 “Are you from the Sword Sect…”
 “Li Canglan!” Ji Qinglan replied with a smile.
 “Is it really you?” Feng Xian was also delighted. He did not expect to meet someone from the Ancient Immortal Domain.
 Ji Qinglan and Feng Xian began to chat and talk about their previous lives.
 The two seemed like close friends who had not seen each other for a long time. For a moment, they seemed to have endless things to talk about. And in the end, they conversed about the incident a few days ago when the Sword Devil Ni Cang returned.
 “We were fortunate that my senior brother took action and killed Sword Devil Ni Cang with just one slash!” Ji Qinglan’s statement shocked Feng Xian further.
 He knew of Sword Devil Ni Cang. That was a devil that the various large factions of the Lingtian Immortal Domain once feared.
 Even with his power level from his previous life, he was not Sword Devil Ni Cang’s match.
  Ni Cang had sparked countless disasters in the past, and many Golden Immortals and Heaven Immortals had died under his hands.
 The Sword Sect was almost destroyed by him back then. At that time, Li Canglan sacrificed his life as the price to seal the Sword Devil, causing a stir in the entire Immortal Domain.
 Therefore, Feng Xian heard about this matter back then. However, he was killed a few years after Li Canglan’s death.
 “Oh yes, I forgot to introduce my senior brother to you. This is him, Li Yu!” introduced Ji Qinglan.
 “Li Yu? So this is the number one prodigy of our human race, Li Yu? No wonder he’s so exceptional!” Feng Xian was even more surprised to learn Li Yu’s identity from Ji Qinglan.
 He did not expect to meet the number one on the Sons of Heaven Rankings, Li Yu.
 Previously, he was curious about what Li Yu’s unknown cultivation represented. Now, it seemed that this ‘Unknown’ meant unfathomable.
 Based on his previous life’s experience, it was not an exaggeration to describe Li Yu’s capability as heaven-defying. Perhaps this fellow was the reincarnation of a Heavenly Venerable.
 He felt he deserved to be defeated by Li Yu just now. It would not be embarrassing if he could follow this man.
 “Since you are Li Yu, I, Feng Xian, am willing to follow you. This is the national treasure of our Ancient Divine Azure Dragon Kingdom, the Divine Azure Dragon Soul Banner. It’s a supreme-grade ancient saint weapon that can summon the souls of nine azure dragons!” Feng Xian took out a flag with nine lifelike azure dragons embroidered.
 “And this is the divine seal fragment passed down from our Ancient Kingdom. A total of nine pieces form a whole, but we only gathered three back then. It’s said that it can open the legendary Four Spirits Mystic Realm!”
     

 “Mm, very good! You’re sincere enough!” Li Yu nodded in satisfaction.
 Since Feng Xian had already contributed his national treasure and the secrets of the Four Spirits Mystic Realm, such sincerity was sufficient enough.
 Li Yu had already read about the Four Spirit Mystic Realm from the system mission related to Feng Xian on the interface.
 Therefore, when Feng Xian mentioned the Four Spirits Mystic Realm, Li Yu could confirm that Feng Xian sincerely desired to follow him.
 “Cultivator Li, may I have the honor of joining your Qingyun Sect?” Feng Xian pleaded to Li Yu with expectation.
 “Of course, you may!” Li Yu did not stand on ceremony as he put away all the treasures Feng Xian had contributed and nodded.
 In fact, Feng Xian was the true treasure to Li
 Yu.
 A genius proficient in array formations, talismans, and restrictions was of great use to the sect.
 More importantly, they urgently needed to break an array formation at the moment.
 Feng Xian was exhilarated to hear that.
 In his heart, the various Holy Lands of the Immortal Martial World looked down on him, so he was unwilling to join any side.
 He even felt lonely at one point, as if he was an exception to this mortal world. He was used to being alone.
 Still, he yearned to have friends and return to the Immortal Domain to find his former clansmen.
 However, his country no longer existed, and it was unknown if his people were still alive. He felt lost again.
 Fortunately, he met an old friend today. Plus Li Yu, who had an impressive background like them.
 Hence, he suddenly felt as if he had found his belonging If he could become a fellow disciple like Li Yu and Li Canglan, his future cultivation path would no longer be lonely.
 Moreover, with his experience from two lifetimes, Li Yu was definitely not simple. From now onwards, he might be able to borrow Li Yu’s light to ride the wind.
 “Feng Xian, are you sure you can break any array formation?” Li Yu inquired.
 “I can break most of the array formations in the Lingtian Mystic Realm!” Feng Xian asserted confidently.
 “That’s good. Help us crack a few array formations!” Li Yu smiled.
 He had just found the actual treasure vault of the Sword Sect with Ji Qinglan. It contained all of the Sword Sect’s wealth.
 According to Ji Qinglan, the items inside were worth the entire Immortal Martial World.
  It had to be known that the Sword Sect used to be a faction second only to the Ancient Families, the Ancient Royals, and the Eternal Orthodoxies in the Ancient Lingtian Immortal Domain.
 The wealth accumulated over countless years was shocking
 However, the treasure vault was protected by layers of array formations. In the past, a Grand Elder, the Sect Master, and the Grand Elder would have to hold the token in sync in order to open the treasure vault.
 Therefore, Ji Qinglan could not open the treasure vault now.
 Furthermore, if the external array formation was destroyed by force, the internal array formation would erase everything in the treasure vault.
 That was why Li Yu did not break open the treasure vault with his sword.
 They were already prepared to give up on the treasure vault, but they did not expect to encounter Feng Xian, the genius with expertise in cracking array formations.
 It simply gave him a pillow when he was tired and a girl when he was lonely.
    
Chapter 197 The Mystery of the Disappearance of the People in the Lingtian Mystic Realm (1)  With Feng Xian’s help, Li Yu and Ji Qinglan finally opened the Sword Sect’s treasury.
 The array formation securing the treasure vault was incredibly complicated. Several different array formations were interconnected, and any problem with one of them would lead to failure.
 According to Feng Xian, the person who set up these array formations back then was definitely a genius second to none in array formations.
 In order not to damage the treasures in the treasure vault, Feng Xian took meticulous care in the process of cracking them. It took him three days to solve all the array formations.
 Finally, they successfully opened the treasure vault door.
 The items in the treasure vault were worthy of their efforts.
 All the cornerstones of the Sword Sect and their prized treasures were inside. It took Li Yu and the others a long time to collect and move them out.
  A small mountain of treasure piled up on the Misty Immortal Island.
 Li Yu was in a good mood as he looked at the mountain of wealth before him. Although the treasures he had obtained from the Demon God Palace were even more valuable than those of the Sword Sect.
 However, the wealth of the Sword Sect was more effective in the overall development of the sect.
 “Actually, I’ve been thinking about a question for the past few days. Was it really only the invasion of the Devil Immortals that reduced the Ancient Immortal Domain to a wasteland back then?” Feng Xian suddenly asked thoughtfully.
     

 His words caused Ji Qinglan to ponder. He had been thinking about what had happened in the Immortal Domain back then.
 “Back then, it was believed that our Immortal Domain was ravaged by the invasion of the Devil Immortals. Countless died in the war between the two sides. The world collapsed, making the Immortal Domain no longer suitable for living and reduced to a wasteland.
 “However, why didn’t anyone take anything with them when they left? It’s the same for the Sword Sect and our Ancient Divine Azure Dragon Kingdom.
 “It felt as if everyone had instantly evaporated. Understandably, your Sword Sect’s treasure vault could not be opened because of the death of the sect master.
 “So why are many of the treasures in our Ancient Divine Azure Dragon Kingdom’s palace still untouched. They were not protected by any array formations.
 “This makes me wonder what happened that made them leave without taking anything with them! Or perhaps something happened that made those from the Ancient Lingtian Immortal Domain disappear instantly!”
 Feng Xian’s opinion resonated with Ji Qinglan. He nodded in agreement. “I’ve been thinking the same over the past few days. Other than this treasure vault, the things in our Sword Sect’s library and Pill Pavilion are actually intact. What you mentioned really makes me feel that people from our Immortal Domain suddenly vanished back then!”
 “Wait, before the two of you entered here, have you heard that if you can’t exit the Lingtian Mystic Realm before it closes, you will never be able to leave again? I’ve heard of people not departing in time. When the mystic realm opens, those people always disappear from here.”
 “What would happen hereafter once the mystic realm closed? Where did those people that stayed go? It had always been a mystery.
 “In this mystic realm, only those who had been sealed, such as the Sword Devil, or those hidden in isolated independent spaces like the Misty Immortal Island, could survive. While there were no traces of anyone else.
 “Perhaps some died because of the devil invasion, but most seem to vanish because of something else!”
 Feng Xian’s comments seemed to shroud the already bizarre and mysterious Lingtian Mystic Realm in another layer of mystery.
 Li Yu’s curiosity was piqued. He suddenly remembered the twin artifact spirits in the Dao Seeking Tower.
 Thus, he brought out the Dao Seeking Tower and walked in to ask for details of the Ancient Immortal Domain. Indeed, just as Feng Xian had guessed, the people of the Immortal Domain seemed to have suddenly evaporated.
     

 As for how they disappeared, the artifact spirit did not know either.
 “I have a way to find the answer!” Li Yu suddenly smiled.
 “What is it?” Ji Qinglan and Feng Xian looked at Li Yu with anticipation.
 “We’ll stay here after the mystic realm closes too! We’ll see what happens!”
 “That’s a good idea! It’s just a little dangerous!” Feng Xian nodded.
 “You took it seriously?” Li Yu grinned. “I was just joking. Why would I stay here for decades? Forget it, don’t think about it anymore. We’ll probably find out sooner or later.”
 “Oh yes, Qinglan, how’s Elder Niels fusion with that body?” Li Yu changed the topic.
 The soulless body they had obtained in the Pan Emperor’s Immortal Abode was given to Elder Nie for fusion.
 “Elder Nie is still in seclusion, but I believe there shouldn’t be any problems!” Ji Qinglan responded.
 “Alright, gather everyone. We are preparing to set off!” Li Yu ordered.
  His junior brothers’ cultivation levels had already improved enough. The weakest was at the Soul Formation Intermediate Stage, and they could protect themselves in this mystic realm.
 Therefore, Li Yu decided to let them go out to train and experience life.
 Soon, Tang Chi, Ye Qiu, Gu Yuqi, and the others arrived. Li Yu brought everyone and left the Misty Immortal Island and the Sword Sect.
 They continued to explore this Ancient Immortal Domain.
 “Eldest Senior Brother, if we encounter any more danger this time, let us handle it. You may rest!” Gu Yuqi looked smug.
 Now that he had stepped into the Immortal Spirit Realm and fused with the Paragon Bone, his Ancient God Body had awakened further, allowing his strength to improve. His confidence had also soared. He was eager to experience a satisfying battle.
 “Yeah, it’s our turn to help our Eldest Senior Brother now!” Ye Qiu, Tang Chi, and the rest also looked confident.
 They were like young men who had just grown some armpit hair and could not wait to prove themselves to the adults.
    

 Chapter 198 The Mystery of the Disappearance of the People in the Lingtian Mystic Realm (2)  Of course, Li Yu was naturally pleased to see his junior brothers become stronger. He was also happy to see his junior brothers become experts who no longer needed his protection.
 This way, he could have more free time in the future.
 Rumble!
 As they spoke, muffled thunder suddenly resounded through the world. The surrounding void trembled slightly, and the power of heaven and earth seemed to begin fluctuating violently.
 A strange light emerged from the distant sky, and circles of ripples appeared in space.
 This sudden change made everyone’s expressions turn serious as they looked at the strange light in the distance.
 “Did something appear there?” Li Yu was curious.
  “Eldest Senior Brother, I’ll go take a look!” Gu Yuqi was enthusiastic. Before he finished his sentence, he had already rushed over.
 However, in the next second…
 Blast!
 Gu Yuqi seemed to have hit a transparent barrier as he got bounced back.
 He had just flown at extreme speed. This head-on collision made him dizzy, and he almost fell from the sky.
 Upon seeing this, everyone revealed strange expressions.
 Ugh, shit happens again.
     



 
 








 Li Yu was at a loss whether to laugh or cry.
 The moment Gu Yuqi rushed out just now, he had an ominous feeling.
 Even if this junior brother became an Immortal, his luck did not improve.
 Li Yu and the rest quickly flew over. Indeed, there was nothing visible blocking their way.
 However, right at this moment, the fluctuations of the power of heaven and earth became even more intense. It was like a raging wind, and the surrounding spatial fluxes became increasingly drastic.
 At the same time, spatial rifts appeared like black lightning bolts that flickered in the sky. They were like the eyes of a devil that had opened, emitting a chilling light.
 The entire sky seemed like it was about to collapse at any moment. It gave one a sense of danger as if the world was ending.
 “Junior Brother Gu, you’re amazing. You crashed through space!” Tang Chi teased, alleviating the tense atmosphere.
 Li Yu reached out to sense the air in front of him. Indeed, there seemed to be a transparent barrier blocking the way.
 Suddenly, something even stranger happened. The space on the other side, separated by the invisible barrier, suddenly began shifting horizontally.
 “This is…” Li Yu was shocked. The space in front of him was like the world he had seen in Inception. It casually folded, reversed, overlapped, transformed, separated, and recombined.
 And in the end, cracks began spreading across the transparent spatial barrier like a shattered mirror.
  A terrifying destructive aura spread from those cracks, and Li Yu and the others quickly retreated.
 Immediately, with a boom, the transparent spatial barrier collapsed into countless fragments. Then, under the effect of unknown power, it reassembled and returned to calm.
 The space before him transited into another scene, and the transparent spatial barrier still existed. It was like a panel of transparent glass that separated two completely different worlds.
 On the other side was a hidden and dark underground world with a peculiar altar.
 Complex totems flickered on the altar as a group of people sat cross-legged around it, undergoing some sort of mysterious ritual.
 Their bodies were enveloped by a purple-black light while a savage face flickered in and out of existence.
     



 
 








 Three men stood at the side, staring at Li Yu and the others in shock.
 The leader of the three was a man with a lazy posture, casual clothes, and loose hair.
 He frowned as he carefully sized up Li Yu and the others, and a wisp of killing intent surfaced in his eyes.
 He walked towards Li Yu’s group. However, he knew there was a spatial barrier in front of him, so he stopped before it and reached out his hand to touch it.
 The two men behind him said something, but they could not hear it.
 The man’s cold gaze swept across Ji Qinglan, Ye Qiu, Tang Chi, and the others before finally stopping on Li Yu. He walked up to Li Yu.
 The two appeared to be standing face to face, but they were in two different worlds, and neither could touch the other.
 However, the killing intent in the man’s eyes seemed capable of penetrating the spatial barrier.
 If not for the spatial barrier, he would probably have already attacked.
 Li Yu observed the man as well. He did not know this person, but he did not seem like a good person.
 Suddenly, the man swung his fist at the spatial barrier, causing it to ripple slightly.
 Seeing the man punch, Li Yu remained on the spot. He grinned before firing his fist at the spatial barrier.
 The corners of the man’s mouth had just surfaced with a cold smile when it instantly froze. A wisp of horror appeared in his eyes as he retreated rapidly.
  At the same time, the spatial barrier in front of Li Yu seemed like a shattered mirror as it broke, and everything around it collapsed.
 Finally, the entire area seemed to have become a black hole vortex that devoured the surrounding shattered space.
 At the same time, green halos spread out from the shattered space. They gathered into a green ball of light as a result that flew into Li Yu’s body.
 Sa
 “Ding—Collected world origin power!”
 Li Yu was quite surprised to hear the system’s notification.
 World origin power? That sounds impressive just hearing its name.
 Gu Yuqi can really attract good stuff every time he encounters something unfortunate.
    
Chapter 199 The Mystery of the Disappearance of the People in the Lingtian Mystic Realm (3)
 And this time, Li Yu punched out this world’s Origin Power.
 Before long, the area in front of him calmed down. The invisible spatial barrier disappeared, and the surroundings returned to normal. However, the spatial rift in the sky remained.
 It became thicker and more gnarly. A destructive aura spread out from the crack, accompanied by bolts of lightning that bombarded the ground from the sky.
 “Everyone says that the space in the Lingtian Mystic Realm is strange. I didn’t expect it to be even more unbelievable than the legends!”
 “What did we just witness? An illusion?”
 “Feng Xian, that wasn’t some kind of illusion array, right?” Ji Qinglan asked Feng Xian.
 “No, there should be some overlapping of space. We should be looking at an unknown location in the mystic realm just now!”
  “Who were those people just now?”
 “I don’t know him, but they don’t look friendly at all!”
 “That ritual seems to be a reincarnation ritual!” Feng Xian remarked.
 “They were definitely up to no good! I wonder if Eldest Senior Brother’s punch just now could wipe them out along with that space!” Everyone discussed.
     

 “Oh yes, Eldest Senior Brother, what was that green ball of light just now?” “A trace of this world’s Origin Power!” replied Li Yu.
 “The origin of the world!” Feng Xian and Ji Qinglan’s eyes widened.
 They knew what the world’s origin represented. It was the Origin Power of a world. If one could fully grasp all the origins of this world, one could take full control of a realm and even possess the Creator’s ability.
 Although the Lingtian Mystic Realm had already become a world on the verge of collapse, a starving camel was always more oversized than a horse.
 The origin power of this world was still superior to the origin of the Immortal Martial World.
 If Li Yu could step into the Saint Lord realm in the future, he could even use the origin power of the Lingtian Mystic Realm to easily create a new world.
 “What is the origin of the world?” Tang Chi and the others asked curiously.
 Feng Xian and Ji Qinglan explained to everyone while Li Yu looked up at the sky that seemed on the brink of collapse.
 Suddenly, an enormous black hole appeared in the cracked sky, and lightning bolts kept exploding
 Roar!
 A roar sounded from the black hole. It was louder than lightning, and gradually, a gigantic figure came out of the black hole.
 It was a monster that seemed to live in the Nine Nether Abyss. It looked incomparably savage.
 Gigantic tentacles squirmed with ghostly faces grew on them. They also had many blade-like fins.
     

 “This is… a Chaos creature!” Feng Xian and Ji Qinglan were stunned to see the monster rushing out of the black hole.
 They had seen such a creature before. It was a powerful creature that lived within the chaotic space.
 Almost simultaneously, another ferocious and terrifying monster crawled out of the spatial rift in the distance.
 It was not only Li Yu and the others. Terrifying monsters had appeared across the sky above the Lingtian Mystic Realm and the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm.
 Countless demons and human cultivators watched the enormous monster in the sky in horror.
 “Oh no, the Lingtian Mystic Realm is really flipped upside down!” The Holy Lord of the Primordial Dao Holy Land, Perfected Tian Hui, remarked with a melancholic expression.
 They had entered the Lingtian Mystic Realm many times, but too many strange things had happened this time.
 Not to mention the appearance of the Devil Immortals, there was also the connection between the Lingtian Mystic Realm and the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm. Now, a spatial rift materialized, and terrifying chaos creatures had appeared.
  This mystic realm is really getting turned upside down.
 Whether they could return home alive this time became uncertain.
 “Eldest Senior Brother, you should rest this time. It’s our turn!” Gu Yuqi looked at the ferocious monster rushing over and rubbed his fists, eager to give it a try.
 It was finally time for them to shine. Gu Yuqi planned to use those monsters as practice.
 “He’s right, Eldest Senior Brother. Let us deal with this monster!” Ye Qiu was also burning with a fighting spirit. He immediately released his aura and let out a battle cry as he rushed toward the Chaos creature.
 Seeing Ye Qiu’s charge, Gu Yuqi’s expression changed. He immediately chased after him and instantly overtook Ye Qiu. Ye Qiu hated to lose as he stomped in the air and quickly caught up to Gu Yuqi.
 However, in the next second, the two of them were smashed down from the sky by the
 monster.
    
Chapter 200 It’s Just His Mount (1)
 Seeing Gu Yuqi and Ye Qiu being sent flying, Wu Chang and Tang Chi quickly rushed up to help.
 The Blood Spirit Monarch knew that this was a chance to showcase himself and followed closely behind.
 Ji Qinglan and Feng Xian could tell that the Chaos creature was extremely powerful, and they probably could not do anything to it even if they joined forces.
 However, seeing that everyone else had rushed off, the two could not seem slack. In any case, Li Yu is watching over them.
 Everyone joined forces and instantly suppressed the Chaos creature. However, the chaos creature was indeed powerful. It churned the already broken void in the sky as if it was about to shatter more.
 Its body was fearless of those spatial cracks. The skin was so hard that even a Dao Artifact could not leave a wound on its body.
 Furthermore, although Gu Yuqi, Ye Qiu, and the others were only in the Immortal Spirit Realm, they had fused with the Paragon Bone and possessed various powerful physiques. They were definitely the cream of the crop.
  Even if their combat strength could not compare to an Exalted Immortal, it was not far off, especially since Gu Yuqi possessed many powerful ancient god bloodline divine powers.
 As for Ji Qinglan and Feng Xian, there was no need to talk about them. The various powerful divine arts and Dao techniques they cultivated in their previous lives, plus their rich combat experience. It meant they were much more powerful than Gu Yuqi.
 It could be said that these few disciples can destroy the Immortal Martial World several times over.
 At this moment, they were doing their best to showcase their abilities and fight back and forth with the Chaos creature.
 Terrifying divine powers and magic power constantly exploded on the enormous body of the Chaos Life Spirit, stirring up the weather. The scene was truly earth-shattering.
 If the mortals of the Immortal Martial World saw this scene, they would definitely be so shocked that their legs would go weak, and their hearts would tremble. They would kneel and worship the living immortals.
 Even the older generation experts of the various Holy Lands were shocked when they saw it. They sighed that a fight between immortals was indeed shocking.
     

 In Li Yu’s eyes, it was nothing.
 However, when he saw his junior brothers grow into such extraordinary experts, Li Yu felt a sense of accomplishment and joy.
 He was also filled with hope for the Qingyun Sect’s future.
 His junior brothers would likely become big shots who could change the world in the future. They would become top experts who could dominate an area and shake the world.
 By then, he could comfortably be a salted fish. Li Yu could occasionally flip over and change his posture to continue being a salted fish.
 “Our senior brothers are so strong. When can we become experts like them!”
 “I want to fight alongside my senior brothers!”
 Su Mu, Lu Yuming, Chen Xiaoqi, Tang Ling’er, Meng Xueqi, and a few other young disciples standing behind Li Yu looked at their senior brothers in the air and remarked with envy.
 In fact, what had happened in the past few months was like a dream to them.
 A few of them were children from ordinary families, especially Su Mu. He did not have any cultivation at all and even faced a life and death situation at one point.
  Regardless, after entering the Qingyun Sect, their lives changed drastically. Their cultivation soared, and it became even more so after entering the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 In the past month, they had experienced various dream-like fortuitous encounters. Now their cultivation had stepped into a realm they had never dared to imagine in the past. They had become experts that only existed in legends a few months ago.
 They were even watching a group of immortals fight monsters, and they also had a chance to touch the immortal realm.
 Everything was like a dream.
 Roar! Roar!
 The Chaos creature suddenly began to rage. Its aura suddenly rose as if it had gone berserk and began to counterattack.
     

 It immediately forced Gu Yuqi, Ye Qiu, Ji Qinglan, and Tang Chi to retreat.
 At the same time, another Chaos creature flew over from afar and attacked the group.
 Faced with two powerful Chaos creatures, everyone immediately fell into a bitter battle. For a moment, they were exhausted and were even struck away.
 Still, Li Yu remained on the spot and did not attack. He wanted everyone to hone themselves and experience life and death battles to expand their potential.
 It would also hone their character.
 Right at this moment, a figure suddenly pounced from behind Li Yu. Li Yu reacted instantly and dodged horizontally, and the figure lunged at empty air.
 With a thud, the figure lay on the ground and let off a cry.
 Li Yu focused his gaze and saw a girl in a red dress.
 It was You Rong.
 You Rong turned around and looked at Li Yu bitterly and pouted.
 “So you’re not dead yet!”
  “Why would I be dead? Why are you here?” Li Yu asked.
 “When the Demon God Palace collapsed, most assumed you were dead. Hmph, I knew you would be fine!” You Rong explained unhappily, but the joy in her eyes betrayed her.
 “You haven’t answered my question. Why are you here? Wait, did you fall from the sky with those ugly monsters?” Li Yu teased.
 “Of course not. I think it must be fate that guided me to you!” You Rong giggled.
 Wow, that’s some f*cking fate!
 Li Yu gave You Rong a look to let her read it herself.
 The junior brothers and sisters at the side were filled with gossip. They looked at each other and smiled without saying a word.
 “You have no idea how close I came to never seeing you again!” You Rong brushed off the leaves on her body and ran to Li Yu’s side as if she had received a new life.
    
Chapter 201 It’s Just His Mount (2)
 Li Yu did not reply as he looked at the battle in the sky. You Rong looked as well.
 “The Chaos creatures here are strong!” You Rong sighed, then she looked at Li Yu. “Don’t you want to know what I encountered after we separated?”
 “No!” Li Yu shook his head. Actually, it was not that he did not want to, nor did he hate You Rong
 He just wanted to tease her. For some reason, it was fun to see her pout and jump around.
 You Rong was so angry that her face bulged. Then, she stomped her feet and said, “Hmph, if you don’t want to know, I’ll tell you! After the Demon God Palace collapsed, we were all sent out. I took advantage of the chaos and escaped.
 “Later on, I encountered a huge opportunity…”
 You Rong began to blabber about the opportunities she had encountered. Li Yu’s left ear was listening, and his attention was actually focused on his junior brother’s battle situation in the air.
  On the other hand, Su Mu and the others listened with relish. The main reason was that the girl in front of them was charming, lively, and cute, which tempted these young men.
 However, they knew that this was their Eldest Senior Brother’s woman. They could not have any improper thoughts.
 “Not long ago, I was captured by the Azure Dragon Race. They wanted to kill me to avenge Long Ao! Fortunately, they encountered a Chaos creature and were attacked. I was lucky enough to escape during the commotion. Otherwise, I would never have seen you again!”
 “That was close!” exclaimed Li Yu.
 Hearing Li Yu’s words, You Rong was instantly overjoyed. She looked at Li Yu in surprise, only to hear him say, “Tang Chi almost lost his life. Although his cultivation is high enough, the divine powers he cultivates are too simple, and he lacks combat experience!”
 Li Yu’s last sentence slapped You Rong’s heart back to the bottom of the valley again. She stomped her feet in anger and said, “You’re not listening to me at all!” “Don’t worry. If they really kill you, I’ll definitely avenge you!” Li Yu said casually.
 “Really? Eh, why do your words sound so strange?”
 “No, they can’t hold on much longer!” Li Yu could tell that Ye Qiu, Gu Yuqi, and the others were about to collapse, so he immediately tapped his foot.
 He instantly rose into the air and shouted, “Move!”
 Seeing Li Yu rush over, Gu Yuqi, Ye Qiu, and the others, who were almost overwhelmed by the two Chaos creatures, revealed looks of joy.
 He immediately retreated. At the same time, Li Yu raised his hand and slashed out. The world shook as the incomparably powerful Chaos creature collapsed along with the surrounding space, and its shattered body was devoured by the collapsed space.
 At the same time, a ball of black and white light was pulled into Li Yu’s hand by a force.
 “Ding… Primordial Chaos Qi collected!”
 Li Yu raised his brows. He did not expect that this Chaos creature would have a treasure drop. According to the system’s introduction, the Primordial Chaos Qi was the origin of vitality, a powerful energy from the beginning of the world.
 It was also the primitive power that evolved everything in the world.
 Another Chaos creature at the side was so frightened that it immediately turned around and fled. However, Li Yu slashed again and killed the Chaos creature with ease.
 Immediately, another ball of Chaos Qi was successfully collected by the system.
     

 “Looks like every Chaos creature has Primordial Chaos Qi in its body. Not bad!” Li Yu remarked happily.
 This was a team of monsters sending treasures from outer space.
 The two terrifying monsters that had just tortured them to death were killed as easily as cutting melons and grass in front of Li Yu.
 Ye Qiu, Gu Yuqi, Tang Chi, Ji Qinglan, Feng Xian, and the others looked at each other.
 Li Yu was really a god that they could never catch up to. They could not be complacent yet. They had to continue working hard.
 After killing the two Chaos creatures, Li Yu flew back again. You Rong’s eyes sparkled as she looked at Li Yu with admiration.
 She was right. Li Yu was really the strongest man in the world besides her Uncle Qing Ye.
 “Oh yes, did you just say that the Azure Dragon Race encountered Chaos creatures too?” Li Yu walked up to You Rong and asked.
 “Yeah, that mount of yours is fighting a bloody battle. I wonder how long it can last!” You Rong said.
 “Where are they?” Li Yu asked. He wanted to hunt as many Chaos creatures as possible to collect the Primordial Chaos Qi. This thing must be of great use.
 Furthermore, Long Yue had already been taken as his mount, so he could not let her be killed. It would be a waste if she died before he had even ridden her.
 “Come with me!” Li Yu’s actions were within You Rong’s expectations. Although she did not like that woman, she had to admit that Long Yue was indeed a stunner who was lethal to men.
 Furthermore, she was already Li Yu’s mount. If she was in danger, Li Yu naturally could not sit back and do nothing.
 In the distance, Long Yue and the Azure Dragons fled as they resisted the attacks of the terrifying Chaos creature.
 They were no match for the Chaos creature at all. If not for Long Yue, their clansmen would have already been devoured by the Chaos creature.
 Even so, Long Yue, Long Tiancang, and the others were severely injured.
 “Father, I’ll stay behind to stop it. You guys leave first. Otherwise, none of us can leave!” Long Yue shouted.
 “Princess, let us stay. You and His Majesty leave first!” The elders shouted.
 At the moment, the corners of their mouths were bleeding, and their faces were pale.
 However, right at this moment, another terrifying Chaos creature crawled out of the void in front of them and rushed towards them.
 Upon seeing this, the hearts of the Azure Dragons turned cold, and Long Yue’s expression was ugly to the extreme.
 She knew that she was probably doomed today. She did not expect that she would not escape death in the end.
 She was unwilling to die like this, but the heavens wanted her dead.
 Suddenly, she thought of Li Yu, the person who had once fought 36 gods in the Demon God Palace and destroyed the realm’s power with a single strike.
 Perhaps only Li Yu had the ability to kill this Chaos creature.
     

 Long Yue laughed bitterly. She did not expect that the hope she had obtained from Li Yu by compromising and putting down her dignity was about to be destroyed again.
 If he had known earlier, he would have let Li Yu kill him back then.
 “It’s over. None of us can leave now!” Long Tiancang’s face was ashen, and his eyes were filled with despair.
 He did not expect such a terrifying change to occur in the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm this time. It seemed that it was not only their Azure Dragon Race.
 The other demons were probably doomed too.
 Roar!
 The two Chaos creatures rushed over at the same time.
 Long Yue bit her red lips and prepared to fight to the death.
 However, just as she was about to charge at the Chaos creature, a figure suddenly appeared in front of her.
 The sword swept out. There was no sword glow or magic power fluctuation, but the space seemed to have been misaligned.
 Then, the gigantic Chaos creature was split into two.
 At the same time, the surrounding space cracked inch by inch, along with the Chaos creature’s body.
 Long Yue, Long Tiancang, and everyone from the dragon race were stunned. They even thought they were hallucinating.
 However, in the next second, the figure flashed and flew towards another Chaos creature that was preparing to escape.
 Another strike instantly killed the terrifying Chaos creature as simple as killing a chicken.
 Everyone from the Azure Dragon Race was dumbfounded and shocked. They even forgot about their fear and despair.
 Their minds went blank.
 Soon, the joy of surviving a calamity surged into their hearts. They looked at the proud figure with incomparable gratitude.
 “It’s him!” Long Yue had mixed feelings. That was a figure she did not want to see, but it was also a figure she had hoped for when she was in despair.
 Li Yu had really appeared. Just as he was on the verge of despair, he descended like a divine weapon and turned the tide, instantly killing the two Chaos creatures.
 He was still as powerful as ever, so powerful that others could not help but revere him.
  However, Li Yu’s appearance was beyond Long Yue’s expectations. She did not expect Li Yu to be here, nor did she expect him to rush over to save her.
 She did not think that she was important to Li Yu, nor did she think that Li Yu had any special feelings for her.
 However, the moment Li Yu appeared, her heart seemed to have stopped for half a beat. There was even a complicated emotion surging in her heart.
 She hoped that that person was not her enemy but her true love.
 After killing the two Chaos creatures, Li Yu collected two balls of Primordial Chaos Qi before turning to look at Long Yue.
 “It’s time to say goodbye to your clansmen!” Li Yu said seriously.
 Li Yu’s words brought Long Yue back to reality.
 She was only his mount.
    
Chapter 202 Disaster (1)
 Seeing Li Yu appear, Long Tiancang, Long Zhi, and the others from the Azure Dragon Race had complicated feelings.
 On the one hand, they were delighted to have survived the calamity. On the other hand, the person who had saved them was the enemy of their Azure Dragon Race-Li Yu.
 They had heard about what happened in the Demon God Palace from Long Yue and Long Zhi.
 Although Long Yue did not want to mention it, many demons had deigned to become Li Yu’s mount after seeing Li Yu defeat her.
 This matter could not be hidden.
 Long Tiancang and the others did not know that the person in front of them was Li Yu, but they were certain after hearing Li Yu’s words.
 The person in front of them who was powerful enough to make them feel reverence was the number one prodigy of the human race, Li Yu.
  They were filled with despair. Facing such an enemy, they felt as if they were facing the heavens.
 Long Ao seemed to have been struck to death by a bolt of lightning from the heavens, but they had no way of taking revenge.
 Today, the heavens wanted to take away their third princess. They wanted to stop it, but there was nothing they could do.
 Furthermore, the Li Yu in front of them seemed to be more terrifying than the heavens, and he terrified them.
 Before Li Yu could finish his sentence, Gu Yuqi, Ye Qiu, Tang Chi, Ji Qinglan, Ji Wanjie, Wu Chang, Feng Xian, and You Rong flew over together.
 Sensing the aura of this group of people, the Azure Dragons were even more shocked, and a chill ran down their spines.
 More than half of this group of people had auras that were on par with Long Yue’s. They even seemed stronger than her. They were all immortals in the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 Everyone from the Azure Dragon Race was stunned to see so many immortals at once.
     

 What was even more shocking was that they all addressed Li Yu as their senior brother. In other words, these people were from the Qingyun Sect.
 The fact that the Qingyun Sect had so many Immortal Spirit Realm cultivators simply subverted their imagination.
 The Qingyun Sect was filled with crouching tigers and hidden dragons. The decline of the human race was simply the biggest scam of the century.
 Fortunately, their Azure Dragon Race did not listen to the Nine-Headed Lion Race’s propaganda and start a war with the humans. Otherwise, it would not have been the demons dominating the Immortal Martial World.
 It was the complete destruction of the demon race.
 Long Yue’s eyes were also filled with surprise. She had thought that the Qingyun Sect only had a freak like Li Yu. She did not expect it to have so many immortals in the Immortal Spirit Realm.
 Furthermore, everyone’s aura was extraordinary, even more powerful than his.
 Compared to them, the cultivation he was so proud of instantly became ordinary and not worth mentioning.
 “What kind of existence is the Qingyun Sect?” Long Yue was suddenly curious.
 She even wondered if the Qingyun Sect was a sect in the Immortal Domain. Otherwise, how could there be so many Immortal Spirit Realm disciples?
 “Let’s go!” Li Yu said.
 Long Yue looked at Long Tiancang with a complicated expression and bowed with cupped hands, but she could not speak.
 Meanwhile, Long Tiancang arrived in front of Long Yue. He reached out to stroke the hair by her ear and said in a low voice, “Go on, child. This might not be a bad thing! You’re the pride of our Azure Dragon Race. Go take a look at the sky on behalf of your father, your older brother, and our Azure Dragon Race!”
 Long Tiancang was not admitting defeat. It was just that he had just realized something.
 With so many Chaos creatures appearing, it was unknown if the Azure Dragon Race could leave alive.
 However, as long as Long Yue followed Li Yu, she should have a way out.
     

 Furthermore, they had witnessed how extraordinary Li Yu was. This person was definitely not ordinary, and his background was not simple.
 As the saying went, when a person attained the Dao, his chickens and dogs would ascend to the heavens as well. Perhaps it was an opportunity for Long Yue to follow Li Yu, not misfortune and humiliation.
 Hearing Long Tiancang’s words, Long Yue’s eyes moistened. She knelt on the ground and kowtowed a few times to Long Tiancang before turning around and flying towards Li
 Yu.
 She knew that this farewell might be the difference between life and death, but it was as her father had said.
 She wanted to bring the hopes and dreams of the Azure Dragon Race to break through the shackles of heaven and earth and lead them to the Nine Heavens Immortal Realm.
 She was willing to do anything for it.
 After taking Long Yue away, Li Yu continued to search for the surrounding Chaos creatures and began to kill them along the way to collect Primordial Chaos Qi.
 He casually killed one Chaos creature after another, and his experience points were steadily increasing.
 More and more Primordial Chaos Qi accumulated.
 On a certain mountain, a giant Chaos creature easily flattened a mountain. Those terrifying tentacles easily stirred the world.
  Under the sweep, the world collapsed. The Golden Feather Race, the Phoenix Bird Race, and the Demon Fox Race were like fallen leaves in a violent wind that flew in all directions without any ability to resist.
 More than half of the thousand people were dead or injured in an instant. Zha Zha Hui and Qian Yu were also severely injured. Their auras were weak, and their faces were filled with shock.
 The Demon Fox Race’s Gu Yue was lucky enough to dodge the center of the power just now. However, the aftershocks made her face turn pale, and her eyes were filled with horror and despair.
 She did not expect such a change to occur and encounter such a terrifying monster.
 “Looks like we’re really going to become food for this monster today!” Gu Yue felt a chill run down her spine as she watched her clansmen being swallowed by the monster’s mouth.
 However, right at this moment, the monster’s body suddenly stopped. Immediately, it was as if a gigantic sword shadow that could split the heavens and the earth had slashed down from above.
 For a moment, it was as if the world fell silent. The tentacles of the Chaos creature that looked like a world-destroying demon god suddenly fell, and its enormous body collapsed like a collapsing mountain.
 At the same time, a figure appeared above the monster’s head. His entire body seemed to be bathed in golden light, and he had an extraordinary bearing.
    
Chapter 203 Disaster (2)  With a wave of his hand, a ball of black and white light landed in his hand and disappeared.
 “It’s Li Yu!” Gu Yue recognized the extraordinary person who had saved them with a single glance. She was extremely excited, and admiration surged in her charming eyes.
 He was like a ray of light in the endless night that shone into Gu Yue’s heart. Not only were her eyes moist, but even the depths of the dense bushes were moist.
 After killing the Chaos creature, Li Yu did not stay any longer. His figure flashed and disappeared on the spot again.
 When he reappeared, he was already beside another Chaos creature. With the same strike, the Chaos creature that was still searching for prey became Li Yu’s prey.
 This scene was seen by the Chaos creature that had just emerged from the spatial rift in the sky.
 They were so frightened that their souls left their bodies. They instantly shrank back and fled into the chaotic void.
  In a valley, Benbo’erba lay on the ground in despair, covered in blood.
 Benbo’erba was scared out of his wits as he watched his clansmen being devoured by that terrifying monster.
 He wanted to run, but he could not move. At this moment, the giant tentacle opened its mouth and devoured him.
 Benbo’erba wailed in fear.
 However, right at this moment, another smaller Chaos creature flew over and let out strange roars.
     

 Upon hearing this cry, the Chaos creature instantly stopped moving. Its enormous mouthpart stopped three feet in front of Benbo’erba.
 Then, it suddenly shrank back as the Chaos creature rapidly flew up as if it was escaping for its life. It crawled into the spatial rift above and disappeared. At the same time, Li Yu’s figure appeared above the valley. He looked around in surprise before flying into the distance again.
 While Li Yu was hunting Chaos creatures all over the world, Gu Yuqi, Tang Chi, and the others returned to the Misty Immortal Island to cultivate.
 They did not expect that after they came out of seclusion, they were filled with ambition and wanted to show off their might and kill everyone.
 In the end, they had just come out when they encountered the Chaos creature invasion. They could not help, and following behind Li Yu would only affect his sword drawing speed.
 Therefore, he simply returned to the island to continue his studies.
 Li Yu also placed the Dao Seeking Tower on the Misty Immortal Island for everyone to enter and train. After all, a mere cultivation realm was not enough.
 He had to hone his Dao techniques and train his combat experience through life and death battles.
 As for Long Yue, who was on the Misty Immortal Island for the first time, she was shocked by everything she saw.
 However, when she saw the fairies address Li Yu as their master, the divine beast Qilin, and the well-trained Xin Ba, she suddenly felt much better.
 “Are you guys alright?”
  After Li Yu killed a Chaos creature that was attacking the human cultivators, he arrived beside the survivors to check on the situation.
 “I’m fine. Cough, cough, thank you, Immortal Master!” The few surviving human cultivators said with difficulty.
 “Oh yes, Immortal Master, the various Holy Lands have sent out news to gather at Tianheng Mountain. We’re leaving early. We’re about to meet up with them!” One of the cultivators said.
 “Leaving early?” Li Yu was slightly surprised. It seemed that the various Holy Lands had sensed the abnormality in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 Furthermore, after seeing the human cultivators, Li Yu could basically confirm that the current Lingtian Mystic Realm and the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm had already fused.
     

 “Alright, then come with me!” Li Yu said.
 Since everyone was prepared to leave, he could not stay here any longer.
 At the foot of Tianheng Mountain in the Lingtian Mystic Realm. The cultivators of the seven Holy Lands and the various sects were gathered here.
 This was also the place where the teleportation array opened every time everyone left the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 Two days ago, the various Holy Lands urgently sent out news to gather all the human cultivators here and prepare to leave the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 Ever since the Immortal Court saw the devil invasion last time, the Holy Lords of the various Holy Lands had carefully investigated the situation in the Immortal Court.
 They had discovered the true secret of the Lingtian Mystic Realm’s decline into a wasteland and the reason for its abnormality.
 The stability period of the Lingtian Mystic Realm had shortened, and unknown changes had occurred in space. The situation was about to change in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 If they did not evacuate this place as soon as possible, only death awaited them.
 However, if they wanted to leave early, they needed to activate the teleportation array at the same time as the Immortal Martial World to open a stable passage.
 Therefore, the Holy Lords crushed their life talisman jade slips so that the people in the Holy Land would know the signal they sent.
  They opened the spatial passageway in advance, but they did not expect that the teleportation array would not be activated after a day.
 There was no news from the seven Holy Lands, and everyone had a bad feeling. It seemed like something had happened in the Immortal Martial World.
 However, not long ago, the thing they were most worried about happened.
 A gigantic spatial rift filled the sky as a terrifying Chaos creature crawled out of it.
 Upon seeing the appearance of the Chaos creature, the hearts of Perfected Tian Hui, Perfected Qing Xiao, Perfected Biyao, and the other Holy Lords sank to the bottom, and they were filled with despair.
 They knew that the journey home this time was a narrow escape.
 The human cultivators did not cower in the face of the Chaos creature that was countless times stronger than them.
 The Holy Lords of the various Holy Lands were the first to take action. The other Holy Land experts followed closely behind and joined forces to set up the powerful Heavenly Constellation Array.
    
Chapter 204 Disaster (3)
 This was a joint attack array formation jointly grasped by the seven Holy Lands. It was used together at the moment of life and death for the human race.
 The cultivators from the other sects, families, and factions did not stand by and do nothing. They joined the battle and used their powers to protect the grand array formation.
 They were well aware that no one had any way out at the moment. There was definitely more than one such monster. They could only work together to resist this Chaos creature.
 Otherwise, only death awaited them.
 In the face of life and death, the thousands of cultivators were unprecedentedly united. Everyone did not hold back and even stimulated their potential.
 It really erupted with a power that could shake the heavens and the earth. Coupled with the Heavenly Constellation Grand Array, it successfully blocked a few waves of attacks from the Chaos creature.
 However, the power of this Chaos creature exceeded their imagination. After bitterly holding on for a few minutes.
  The Heavenly Constellation Array was still destroyed. Everyone was injured and sent flying while the Chaos creature began its hunt.
     

 The giant mouthparts devoured lives one after another, and the scene was filled with wailing
 The Holy Lords and elders of the various Holy Lands were still organizing everyone to form a partial defense to protect the young disciples behind them.
 Although they knew that this was a meaningless struggle, they did not have the time to think too much at this moment. It was all instinctive. There was no reason for them to do so out of the concern of their elders for their juniors!
 “It’s over. I’m really going to die here!” In the crowd, the heavily injured Zhu Xiaotian looked at the behemoth that made him despair as he waited for death.
 He was unwilling to accept this fate. Although all his schemes had failed in his rebirth, this trip to the Lingtian Mystic Realm had indeed given him the chance to defy the heavens and change his fate.
 He had obtained a pretty good opportunity. His cultivation had advanced from the Golden Core Realm to the late stage of the Soul Formation Realm, and he had also obtained an immortal technique suitable for the cultivation of the Stellar Dao Body.
 He thought that he was about to see a beautiful future, but he did not expect to die here today.
 He was really unwilling to accept this.
 “Sect Master, be careful!” With a cry, Perfected Taiwu of the Jade Pure Dao Sect pushed away the heavily injured Perfected Yu Hua, who was vomiting blood.
     

 Meanwhile, he was grabbed by the Chaos creature’s tentacles and instantly devoured by the gigantic mouth.
 “Taiwu!” Perfected Yu Hua’s pupils trembled as he roared in grief.
 However, Perfected Taiwu could no longer hear it.
 However, there were many more cultivators who were devoured by the Chaos creature like Perfected Taiwu.
  As for those people’s relatives, friends, and fellow disciples, they rushed towards the Chaos creature with anger and hatred.
 However, some people’s beliefs and defenses collapsed, and some thought of Li Yu in despair.
 “Li Yu, Immortal Master, where are you? Come and help us!”
 However, at this moment, everything that happened here was presented to everyone in the Immortal Martial World by the Genius Excellence Rankings.
 The person on the rankings not long ago was a human prodigy. However, no one expected his Elegance Exhibition to be such a terrifying scene.
 In an instant, the hearts of all the humans were shrouded in gloom and dominated by fear. They felt as if an ice cave was in their hearts as they wailed.
 The demon race’s continuous attacks on the seven Holy Lands had already suffocated the humans. If these last hopes were to be buried in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 In that case, the human race was doomed!
    
Chapter 205 Give It to Me
 “Hold on a little longer. Li Yu will definitely come!” Perfected Tian Hui shouted.
 In fact, he was also in despair facing this terrifying Chaos creature. He was well aware that no one present could defeat this monster even if they joined forces.
 Li Yu was their last hope.
 This was the only belief he and the Holy Lords and elders persevered with.
 There was no doubt about Li Yu’s strength since he could kill that devil. Moreover, they had already sent many people to inform everyone to gather here over the past two days.
 He believed that Li Yu would definitely receive the information.
 Before Perfected Tian Hui could finish his sentence, Li Yu’s figure appeared above the Chaos creature. He held his sword and slashed down.
  This sword was like a ray of light in the darkness that pushed away the darkness and shone into the despair of countless people.
 The world seemed to stop for a moment. The Chaos creature’s body froze before it collapsed with a bang.
 “It’s Li Yu!”
 “It’s really Li Yu. This is great. The immortal master is really here!”
 “We’re saved! We’re saved!” Countless human cultivators cheered excitedly with tears in their eyes.
 The joy of escaping death made them unable to suppress their emotions, and they cried tears of joy.
 The Holy Lords of the various Holy Lands heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Li Yu appear. However, their exhausted bodies could not withstand it anymore and collapsed to the ground.
 They knew that Li Yu could save them and all the human cultivators again.
 “We’re saved!” Zhu Xiaotian sat on the ground and looked at the god-like Li Yu with a complicated expression.
 He had mixed feelings. This was the guy he used to treat as an enemy, the person he treated as a variable and wanted to get rid of.
 Now that he thought about it, he realized how foolish and laughable he was. He was like a clown playing tricks in front of others.
 He even thought that Li Yu was his stumbling block and was bent on getting rid of him.
 It was simply like a child showing off in front of an adult, who did not take him seriously at all.
 Fortunately, Zhu Xiaotian did not take him seriously. Otherwise, he would have probably died a few times.
 “So this is Li Qingyun’s son!” Perfected Qing Xiao looked at Li Yu with a complicated gaze.
 After the previous incident in the Immortal Court, he had heard from Perfected Taiqing that Li Yu was Li Qingyun’s son.
     

 Thinking back to the past, he could not help but sigh.
 If he had not made a move back then, he would not have forced Li Qingyun to desperation step by step and committed a grave mistake.
 In the end, he had no choice but to part with his beloved disciple, Li Qingyun, and expel him from the Holy Land.
 He once regretted his decision back then, but due to his reputation and status, he could not help Li Qingyun again.
 It allowed him to walk step by step into the abyss until he lost contact.
 Perfected Qing Xiao had once lost Li Qingyun or fallen into the demonic path.
 However, he did not expect that Li Qingyun would return after a hundred years. He founded the Qingyun Sect and nurtured an unbelievable expert like Li Yu.
 They did not expect Li Yu to save their lives twice and save countless human cultivators.
 Li Qingyun did not hate the orthodox sects for everything that had happened back then. He was so broad-minded that he did not care about the past, making even his master feel ashamed of his inferiority.
 “Fortunately, our human race has an expert like Li Yu!”
 “Yeah, I thought I was really going to die here today!”
 “Li Yu is really a peerless sword god. He actually killed such a terrifying Chaos creature with a single strike!”
 “Hmm, it was the same last time with the Sword Devil. He insta-killed with a single strike. It seems that no matter how powerful an enemy is, it’s a matter of a single strike in front of Li Yu!”
 “I’m afraid even the Heavenly Dao can’t see through his strength. That unknown cultivation level might not be deliberately hidden by the Heavenly Dao!”
  “Li Yu must be the reincarnation of a sword god! Otherwise, how could he be so strong at such a young age!”
 The people who had survived the calamity discussed. Other than joy, he was also shocked by Li Yu’s power.
 The scene of Li Yu killing the Chaos creature was also presented to the entire Immortal Martial World through the Genius Excellence Rankings.
 However, everyone knew that the figure was Li Yu, the blazing sun that seemed to have parted the dark clouds.
 That was a reassuring figure.
 In an instant, countless human cultivators in the Immortal Martial World boiled over.
 Their gloomy hearts were reignited with flames of hope.
 They believed that Li Yu would return with all the human cultivators. That would be the time of the demon race’s destruction.
 “That person is Li Yu? He’s really strong!” Lu Li withdrew her gaze from the Heavenly Dao Rankings that had already disappeared.
 Her sparkling eyes flickered with surprise.
     

 Although she had heard many legends about Li Yu at this stage, this was the first time she had witnessed it with her own eyes.
 Li Yu only had a distant background on the Genius Excellence Rankings, so she could still clearly see Li Yu’s simple sword strike.
 He directly killed the Chaos creature.
 Although she had never seen a Chaos creature with her own eyes, she had heard of such a creature that grew in the chaos space.
 They were born powerful and possessed the most violent power of chaos. It could destroy the world with ease.
 It was said that the weakest of them was at the Golden Immortal realm, and the strongest might not even be a match for a saint.
 Therefore, Lu Li was shocked to see that Li Yu could kill that Chaos creature with a single strike.
 It seemed that Li Yu lived up to his reputation. At the moment, Lu Li was in the Qingyun Sect. After changing her appearance and aura, she successfully entered the Qingyun Sect and became an inner sect disciple.
 She had sensed the extraordinariness of this place when she first arrived at the Qingyun Sect. It was rare to find such a Holy Land in the lower realm.
 This made her even more curious about the Qingyun Sect.
 Of course, she did not really want to stay in the Qingyun Sect to cultivate. She was only curious to understand what kind of sect it was.
 She wanted to understand the owner of the Human Body, Li Yu.
 What surprised her was that according to everyone, Li Yu’s Human Body was only an ordinary human body.
 The explanation from the Heavenly Dao was that Li Yu had refined his human body to the level of a god.
 This was beyond her expectations. While she was shocked, she was also curious about what kind of person Li Yu was. How could he turn a mortal body into a powerful existence that could surpass a sacred body and divine body?
 She wanted to know more about how strong his body was.
 However, she did not expect that no one in the entire sect seemed to really understand Li
 Yu.
 It was like the introduction of Li Yu on the Sons of Heaven Rankings. He seemed to be filled with mysteries and the unknown.
 “Senior Brother, what cultivation realm is our Eldest Senior Brother in?” A youth asked another youth beside him.
  During this period, the number of Qingyun Sect disciples had already doubled.
 Due to Li Yu’s various shocking performances and fortuitous encounters in the Lingtian Mystic Realm, and the continuous appearance of so many elites in the Immortal Spirit Realm in the Qingyun Sect, it instantly became the Holy Land in everyone’s hearts.
 Therefore, young men and women from the Huaxia continent and the various cultivation families of the Great Zenith Domain traveled thousands of kilometers to the Qingyun Sect to become disciples.
 “I don’t know either. No one knows about Eldest Senior Brother’s cultivation level. You only need to know that he’s very, very strong!”
 As countless disciples discussed excitedly, a woman’s voice sounded from the sky. “Qingyun, are you there?”
 Everyone looked over and saw a woman in a colorful dress. She had a graceful figure and a stunning appearance.
 At this moment, Li Qingyun, who was in seclusion, suddenly opened his eyes. There was excitement and disbelief in his eyes.
 “Caiwei?” Li Qingyun’s heart raced as he rushed out of the room.
    
Chapter 206 Gray Mist
 I say
 “Caiwei!” When Li Qingyun saw the unforgettable figure in front of him, he felt as if he was in a dream.
 That was the woman he loved deeply, the person his master had once regarded as a demoness, the person he thought he would never see again.
 Back then, the two of them encountered a disaster caused by a zombie king.
 Li Qingyun still remembered the beautiful figure who used her blood to treat those infected by the zombie poison.
 It was at that moment that the kind and beautiful woman walked into his heart.
 However, the heavens teased them. Gu Caiwei’s true form was a flower demon. Although she was kind-hearted, demons were demons. They were not tolerated by the Holy Land.
  Furthermore, Li Qingyun’s identity was special. He was the brightest star of the orthodox sects at that time and the representative of the younger generation.
 His words and actions concerned the honor of the entire orthodox path.
 According to the Holy Land, he should be a role model. He could not cross the line, nor could he do anything to harm the Holy Land’s reputation.
 Although Gu Caiwei was not a wicked person, she was a demon. If Li Qingyun fell in love with her, it would be intolerable by the heavens and the orthodox path.
 The world would not see Gu Caiwei’s kindness or understand the friendship between the two. They would only see that Li Qingyun’s marriage with the demon race would only damage their trust in the orthodox sects and damage their reputation.
 Because of this, Li Qingyun and his master had a falling out.
 However, something happened that made Li Qingyun explode in anger. Gu Caiwei used a demonic technique to suck human soul essence and was killed by the elders of the Clear Void Holy Land.
 Therefore, in a fit of anger, Li Qingyun attacked the Clear Void Holy Land, which led to the subsequent story.
 Li Qingyun had always thought that Gu Caiwei was dead, but he did not expect that she was not only alive, but she had also appeared in front of him.
 Therefore, Li Qingyun really thought he was dreaming. He could not even believe what he was seeing
 “Qingyun, long time no see!” Gu Caiwei smiled sweetly. Her gaze was still gentle, and her voice was still familiar.
 “Caiwei, it’s really you!” Li Qingyun was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes. He immediately opened the Protective Mountain Array and rushed in front of Gu Caiwei.
     

 He wanted to pull Gu Caiwei into his arms, but he was afraid that his dream would shatter with a single touch.
 On the main peak of the Clear Void Holy Land. After the demons occupied this place, they built a huge altar at Young Master Qing Ye’s request. “Everyone says that the Clear Void Holy Land is the weakest among the seven Holy Lands. I didn’t expect it to be the most cowardly.”
 “Yeah, when we attacked, most of the elders and disciples in the Holy Land fled. The rest surrendered not long after! What cowards!”
 “Hmph, at least they know their place and don’t waste our energy!”
 A group of demons patrolled the Holy Land while discussing.
 “Oh yes, I wonder why Young Master Qing Ye wants to build these altars?”
 “He said that this is to suppress the Holy Land’s Heavenly Vein and prevent the teleportation array in the Lingtian Mystic Realm from opening again. At the same time, it’s used to deal with the immortals sent by the Immortal Domain. This altar can summon the descent of a demon god. Even if a Golden Immortal descends to the mortal world, he can still defeat it!”
 “So that’s how it is. I heard that the Immortal Domain has already sent people to the lower realm and recaptured the Primordial Dao Holy Land!”
 “Indeed. I heard that it was an ancestor from the Primordial Dao Holy Land who ascended to the Immortal Domain. However, Young Master Qing Ye will be able to reclaim it soon!”
 In the forbidden area of the rear mountain of the Clear Void Holy Land, at the ruins of the Demon Sealing Tower, Young Master Qing Ye was standing alone in the ruins.
 This was the Demon Sealing Tower that he had personally destroyed back then, and it was also the place where he found his master.
 “Young Master!” At this moment, a figure emerged from the ground and appeared behind him. He bowed with cupped hands.
 “The altars at the Grand Desolate Forest, the Black Mist Mountain Range, the Endless Sea, and other places with heavenly veins have been built!” That person continued.
 “Mm, very good. Tell our men to get ready. We’ll activate the grand array formation tomorrow at six in the morning!” Young Master Qing Ye ordered.
 “Yes!” That person cupped his hands and returned to the ground before disappearing.
 Qing Ye looked up at the sky and muttered in a low voice, “Master, I know that you’re kind-hearted and can’t bear to harm these mortals. However, for the sake of our home and the countless living beings of our Flower Realm, I have no choice but to do this. I hope you can forgive me for my presumptuous decision!”
 Somewhere in the Black Mist Mountain Range, a large group of people gathered in an underground cave to discuss something.
 If the Clear Void Holy Lord, Perfected Taiqing, was here, he would definitely recognize that these people were the elders and disciples of his Holy Land.
 “Elder, can we really open the Lingtian Mystic Realm here?”
 “Mm, it should be possible. This is the ruins of the once-destroyed Limitless Holy Land. It’s said that this place was also the place where the space of the Lingtian Mystic Realm overlapped. It was also the place where the teleportation array to enter the Lingtian Mystic Realm was activated.” The person who spoke was the Clear Void Holy Land’s Grand Elder, Perfected Zi Xu.
     

 When he saw the various Holy Lands fall one after another, Perfected Zi Xu began to plan to lead everyone from his sect to leave the Holy Land to search for the ruins of the Limitless Holy Land.
 They were well aware that the demons wanted to occupy the Holy Land and seal the exit of the Lingtian Mystic Realm so that no one could come out.
 Therefore, Perfected Zi Xu thought of this.
 If they could not defend the Holy Land with their strength, the Clear Void Holy Land would definitely fall.
 Li Yu and the Qingyun Sect became their hope.
 Therefore, they planned to establish a teleportation array here to bring everyone back from the Lingtian Mystic Realm. Only then could they save the Immortal Martial World.
 They had planned to wait for the day of their return to open.
 However, when they saw the Genius Excellence Rankings not long ago, they immediately understood that something had happened in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 The Holy Lords had already planned to leave the Lingtian Mystic Realm and might have even sent a signal to the various Holy Lands. However, the Holy Lands had already fallen.
 “The Holy Lords are still waiting for us to open the spatial passageway. We have to hurry up and find the exact intersection point to open the spatial passageway!” Perfected Zi Xu said.
 ures
 “Yes!” Everyone received the order and quickly began to use special magic treasures to detect the surrounding power of heaven and earth and spatial fluctuations.
 At the moment, everyone in the Lingtian Mystic Realm looked at Li Yu gratefully after escaping death.
 The masters of the various Holy Lands, sects, and families gathered around Li Yu to express their gratitude.
 “The person who saved us in the Immortal Court last time should be Cultivator Li too, right?” Perfected Tian Hui asked.
  “Oh, yes!” Li Yu replied casually.
 “We already owe Cultivator Li two lives! Looks like we can’t repay him even if we work like cows and horses in our next lives!” Perfected Tian Hui smiled.
 “Holy Lords, there’s no need to be polite. I was only doing it in passing!” Li Yu said with a smile. He was telling the truth. He had killed that devil to complete the mission and gain experience. Saving them was indeed a convenient thing to do.
 “Cultivator Li is too modest! Oh yes, we later discovered some secrets in the Immortal Court. It might be related to the true reason why this place became a wasteland back then?” Perfected Tian Hui added.
 “Oh? What secret is it?” Li Yu knew that this Chaos creature was definitely not the main reason why the Lingtian Immortal Domain had become a wasteland.
 After all, no matter how strong the devils and Chaos creatures were, they were not invincible. They could not make the people of the Immortal Domain disappear instantly.
 “The gray fog!” Perfected Tian Hui said. “This is the reason why we urgently summoned everyone to leave this place. The gray fog is likely to descend here again!”
 “What’s the gray fog?” Li Yu looked at Perfected Tian Hui curiously.
    

 Chapter 207 Rebuilding the World with a Single Strike (1)
 “The gray fog is a mysterious substance that we named. It might also be an unknown and powerful creature. No one knows its full appearance, nor does anyone know where it came from.”
 “We speculate that it might have come from the Chaos Void or the Nine Nether Hell.”
 “The gray fog that filled the sky enveloped us. Inside were countless dead souls. Wherever it passed, all living beings were devoured and became a part of the undead army. Then, it continued to devour other living beings along with the gray fog!”
 Perfected Tian Hui said with a grave expression.
 “This is what we discovered in the Immortal Court. It’s a description of the gray fog. Every time the world falls apart and chaos creatures appear, the gray fog follows closely. It’s the main culprit who killed most people in the Immortal Domain. Many people became dead souls in the gray fog without warning!”
 Li Yu’s expression turned grim when he heard Perfected Tian Hui.
 This gray fog did sound a little scary.
  To be able to devour everyone in the Immortal Domain and instantly reduce the entire Immortal Domain to a desolate wasteland was indeed hair-raising.
 Li Yu was not even sure if he could survive in such a strange gray fog.
 After all, he was still a little bit away from becoming truly invincible.
 However, Li Yu recalled what Ji Qinglan and Feng Xian had said earlier, and all his questions were answered.
 The devil invasion might only be the beginning of the calamity in the Immortal Domain. What was truly terrifying was the gray fog mentioned by the Chaos creatures and Perfected Tian Hui after the world collapsed.
 Furthermore, this gray fog would probably appear every ten or twenty years. This was also the reason why those people lingering in the Lingtian Mystic Realm had disappeared.
     



 
 









 However, the gray fog should not be able to devour those sealed or isolated creatures.
 Therefore, if that was the case, he should be able to escape the invasion of the gray fog by hiding on the Misty Immortal Island when it appeared.
 As Li Yu, Perfected Tian Hui, and the others conversed, wave after wave of battered and injured cultivators flew over from afar.
 Someone in the crowd quickly stepped forward to ask about the situation. “You were attacked by Chaos creatures too, right?”
 “That’s right. More than half of our sect has died. We thought that we were doomed, but I wonder what happened to those monsters. They seemed to have suddenly been frightened and began to flee in panic, returning to the spatial rift.”
 “He escaped by himself? That’s strange, but you guys are lucky enough. If Li Yu hadn’t saved us in time, we would probably have died in the hands of that monster!”
 Everyone discussed with lingering fear.
 Meanwhile, Li Yu asked about how they could leave this place, while Perfected Tian Hui had a worried expression.
  “This is something else I was about to tell you. Something might have happened to our Immortal Martial World!” Perfected Tian Hui’s words made Li Yu’s expression sink.
 Compared to the gray fog, this matter worried him more.
 Somewhere in the Huaxia continent, Guo Shengxiu from the lower realm of the Immortal Domain appeared.
 Immediately, he contacted Dao Yanzi through the magic treasure of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect. He immediately used Earth Shrinking and arrived at the Primordial Dao Holy Land to meet him.
 “What? The person who descended with us is Lu Li?” Hearing Guo Shengxiu’s words, Dao Yanzi was shocked.
     



 
 








 “That’s right. Isn’t Junior Sister Lu with you?” Looking at Dao Yanzi’s reaction, Guo Shengxiu guessed that Lu Li had probably escaped alone.
 “Sigh, after we came down, when everyone split up to investigate, this girl left alone! At the time, I thought it was Lu Yufan. I didn’t expect it to be Lu Li!” Dao Yanzi was worried. If something really happened to Lu Li, he would be too ashamed to go back and see Lu Fanchen.
 “Where did you split up last?” Guo Shengxiu asked.
 “The Heavenly Fate Dynasty, near Qinluan City!”
 “Alright, I’ll go find her. Lu Li came down to play. She shouldn’t be too far away!” Guo Shengxiu said.
 This outcome was in line with his wishes. If Lu Li left alone, he could accompany her to tour the lower realm.
 Perhaps they could develop feelings for each other. Just the thought of it was wonderful.
 “Junior Sister Lu Li, wait for me. I’ll find you soon.’
 After bidding farewell to Dao Yanzi, Guo Shengxiu left the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 “Uncle-Master, Young Master Qing Ye hasn’t appeared. Is he afraid?” A disciple of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect asked.
  “Probably not. Yu Chen and the others should be back soon!” said Dao Yanzi.
 After they took back the Primordial Dao Holy Land, they released the news that they had been waiting for Young Master Qing Ye to arrive, but he had not appeared for a long time.
 “Uncle-Master, I’m back!” Before Dao Yanzi finished his sentence, Lu Yuchen and a disciple of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect flew back.
 “How is it?” Dao Yanzi looked at Lu Yuchen and asked impatiently.
 “Last night, Young Master Qing Ye led the demons to attack the Clear Void Holy Land. I believe he’ll be here soon!” Lu Yuchen said.
 “Okay, then we’ll wait here for him to show himself!” said Dao Yanzi. He could only wait for him to show up. Otherwise, if he left the Primordial Dao Holy Land, this place might immediately fall again.
 More and more cultivators gathered in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 Perfected Tian Hui had also learned that the Chaos creatures had retreated, and this intensified the ominous feeling in his heart.
    
Chapter 208 Rebuilding the World with a Single Strike (2)
 The gray fog might appear soon.
 Although he knew that Li Yu was powerful, the gray fog was truly strange. He was not sure if Li Yu could save them this time.
 “What could have happened in the Immortal Martial World?” Li Yu was in a bad mood.
 Compared to the gray fog, what Perfected Tian Hui had just said annoyed Li Yu. If something really happened to the various Holy Lands and the teleportation array could not be activated, were they really going to be trapped here?
 He did not want to stay here forever. He had collected so many resources and was still waiting to return to respect his father.
 Furthermore, he was worried about his father’s safety. If something happened to the seven Holy Lands, it meant that something major must have happened in the Immortal Martial World.
 “Right, if there’s really no other way, we’ll use the Azure Dragon Race’s teleportation array to return!” Li Yu suddenly thought of a countermeasure.
  He had already confirmed that the Lingtian Mystic Realm and the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm were connected, so he could leave this place through the demon race’s teleportation array.
 However, he did not know if the incident outside had affected the demons, so Li Yu was nervous.
 At this moment, more and more spatial cracks appeared in the sky, and they kept spreading downwards.
 Waves of rumbling sounds continued, and the world shook as if the sky was about to collapse at any moment.
 Suddenly, balls of gray fog spread out from the crack. Ghost cries and wolf howls resounded through the sky. Countless ferocious faces and ghosts appeared and disappeared in the gray fog, as if the door to hell had been opened.
 He could vaguely hear a voice echoing in the howl. “I want to go home, I want to go home!”

 The expressions of the various Holy Lands and sects turned ugly again when they saw the gray fog.
 The strange and sinister aura made them shudder. Furthermore, many of them had heard about the gray fog from the Holy Lords not long ago.
 Therefore, when they saw that the gray fog had really descended, everyone became nervous again.
 They did not know if Li Yu could save them from this strange gray fog.
 Therefore, his heart was in his throat again as he looked at the gray fog that kept spreading down in fear.
 At this moment, it was not only the human cultivators. The surviving demons of the Azure Dragon Race, the Demon Fox Race, and the Golden Feather Race, who had just escaped death, also saw the gray fog. Although they did not know what was going on with the gray fog, they could similarly sense how terrifying it was.
 “Trouble never comes alone. We’ve just escaped from the claws of a Chaos creature, and now we’ve encountered this strange gray fog!” Long Tiancang said with a bitter expression.
 “There’s something wrong with this fog!” “It feels so scary!” “Grandpa, I really want to go home!”
 “What should we do, Your Majesty?”
 As they watched the strange gray fog gradually approach, the expressions of the Azure Dragons became increasingly ugly. The shrill cries of the countless ghosts made their hearts tremble, and the shadow of death enveloped their hearts again.
 “How annoying!” Li Yu frowned. He was slightly displeased, not because he was afraid of the gray fog.
     

 Even if he could not deal with the gray fog, he had a way to avoid it.
 He was unhappy about the appearance of the gray fog. Those fellows from the demon race were probably going to die. He had just thought of leaving this place through the demon race’s teleportation array.
 In the end, the gray fog came out and ruined his plan.
 Why was the journey home so difficult?
 Everyone’s hearts sank when they saw Li Yu’s expression.
 Previously, be it when Li Yu faced the Devil Immortal, the Sword Devil, or the Chaos creature, his expression had always been extremely calm, and there was no fluctuation in his gaze.
 Now that they saw the gray fog and frowned, everyone instantly lost their confidence.
 They felt that Li Yu seemed unable to deal with the gray fog either. Everyone’s hearts were in their throats as they watched the fog invade down. They found it difficult to breathe.
 Their gazes gathered on Li Yu, and the slightest change in Li Yu’s expression tugged at their hearts.
 He was the straw to clutch at in everyone’s hearts. If Li Yu was at his wits’ end, they would probably die today.
 Swoosh!
 Li Yu pulled out the sword behind him and stared at the gray fog that filled the sky with a slightly cold gaze.
 Everyone’s hearts seemed to have stopped as they looked at Li Yu nervously.
 “Get the hell back!”
 With a furious shout, he slashed out seriously.
 Blast!
 The gray fog that filled the sky instantly dissipated, and the spatial rift that had been jumping around like lightning stopped for a moment.
 In the next second, the entire sky collapsed as if a mirror had been shattered, and countless fragments flew backward.
 The world instantly turned into an endless night. The world shook violently, and the light disappeared.
 The entire world seemed to have returned to the beginning of chaos. Soon, the chaotic void divided the world again, and light returned.
 In the end, the entire space recovered. The sky became incomparably blue, and the sky was clear. Even the previous spatial rift had disappeared.
 wa
 At the same time, a dense green ball of light manifested from the void and transformed into a ball of light that looked like a jade ball that landed in Li Yu’s hand.
 “Ding… you have collected all the world origin power in the Lingtian Immortal Domain!”
 Hearing the system’s notification, Li Yu was overjoyed. Was he going to become the ruler of the Lingtian Immortal Domain?
 “It worked!”
 Seeing Li Yu disperse the gray fog, joy appeared on everyone’s shocked faces.
     

 Their hearts, which had fallen to the bottom of the valley, saw the light again. The ups and downs made it impossible for them to calm down for a long time.
 What shocked them more was that Li Yu’s strike seemed to have reshaped heaven and earth.
 It would break apart the crumbling world and reconstruct it, opening up a new and stable world.
 “Is this what it means to rebuild after breaking? Li Yu destroyed the sky with a single strike, but it allowed space to regain its stability!” “That strike from Li Yu just now was simply like the creation of the world. Could he be the reincarnation of Pangu?” “This is unbelievable. He instantly swept away the gray fog that filled the sky with a single strike and even destroyed the entire sky!”
 “The gray fog that could destroy an immortal domain was actually dispersed by a single strike from Li Yu. His power is beyond imagination!”
 Everyone’s understanding of Li Yu was refreshed again.
 The gray fog that could destroy the entire Immortal Domain back then was something that even so many extraordinary experts could not do anything to.
 Yet, it was still no match for Li Yu’s sword.
 Furthermore, this strike not only dispersed the gray fog, but it also reshaped heaven and earth.
 It was clear how strong Li Yu was.
 He was probably the strongest person in the world.
 If the Lingtian Immortal Domain had an expert like Li Yu back then, it would not have fallen to the point of destruction.
 “What happened?” Long Tiancang looked at the calm sky in surprise, wondering what had happened.
 The scene that seemed like the end of the world had suddenly returned to calm.
 “We’re saved!” The Azure Dragons heaved a sigh of relief.
 At this moment, the countless surviving demons were the same, secretly rejoicing that they had finally survived this calamity.
 In the Immortal Martial World, Guo Shengxiu, who had just left the Great Zenith Domain and was preparing to fly to the Huaxia continent, did not expect to meet Young Master Qing Ye on the way.
 “From the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect?” Young Master Qing Ye asked expressionlessly.
 Guo Shengxiu looked at Young Master Qing Ye. He could sense how extraordinary the person in front of him was. Furthermore, someone who could recognize him as part of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect was probably from the Immortal Domain.
 However, he did not know this person. However, it was not difficult to guess this person’s identity after some thought. He was probably the Young Master Qing Ye that his martial uncle had mentioned.
 “You’re the one who destroyed the Primordial Dao Holy Land?” Guo Shengxiu frowned slightly.
 “That’s right! The Primordial Dao Immortal Sect still values the matters here. They actually sent a Perfected Immortal to the lower realm!” Qing Ye said. Then, he waved his right hand, and a vine like a rope instantly wrapped around Guo Shengxiu.
  Guo Shengxiu’s expression changed as he instantly dodged.
 However, Young Master Qing Ye was faster. His terrifying pressure locked onto Guo Shengxiu as an invisible force blasted over.
 Thud!
 Guo Shengxiu could not dodge. He was struck by the invisible force and was sent flying.
 At the same time, the vines instantly bound his body tightly, and his magic power was restrained by the vines.
 Guo Shengxiu was shocked. He could sense that the cultivation and strength of the person in front of him were far above his own.
 “What do you want?” Guo Shengxiu asked, putting on a brave front. “Is Dao Yanzi still in the Primordial Dao Holy Land?” Young Master Qing Ye asked. Then, without waiting for Guo Shengxiu’s reply, he carried him and flew off.
 Before long, the two of them returned to the Primordial Dao Holy Land. “Dao Yanzi, come out!”
    
Chapter 209 Li Yu’s Return (1)
 “You’re the master of the Flower Realm?” Li Qingyun was shocked when he heard Gu Caiwei’s words.
 Although Li Qingyun had already felt that Gu Caiwei was not an ordinary flower demon, he did not expect her to be the master of the Flower Realm.
 In the myriad worlds, apart from the Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, there were many worlds that were not inferior to the Immortal Domain. Many worlds even surpassed the Immortal Domain.
 The Flower Realm was one of them. It was a world opened up by the Flower God.
 As the 19th Flower Realm Master, Gu Caiwei’s cultivation was also at the Sovereign Realm back then. She was truly a true expert that surpassed the world.
 However, ten thousand years ago, the Flower Realm encountered a huge calamity. Realm Master Gu Caiwei fought with the enemy for a few days before falling from the nine heavens. Her fate was unknown.
 a
  The Flower Realm collapsed as well, and a portion of the remaining world fell from the nine heavens with Gu Caiwei.
 In the end, it overlapped and fused with the core area of the Black Mist Mountain Range, destroying the original sect factions there.
 It had become a forbidden place for humans and a mysterious world shrouded in a strange fog.
 After Gu Caiwei died, she turned into a peony flower and fell into the Immortal Martial World, becoming a flower demon in the eyes of the various Holy Lands.
 A hundred years ago, Gu Caiwei was captured by the Clear Void Holy Land and imprisoned in the Demon Sealing Tower. Later on, she was rescued by the Flower Realm and brought back to the Flower Realm, which was on the verge of exhaustion and about to become a wasteland.
 There, she rediscovered her past memories. However, in order to maintain the vitality of the Flower Realm, she fused her main body with it again.
     


 She used her vitality to nourish the Flower Realm, so the Gu Caiwei in front of Li Qingyun was only an incarnation.
 After hearing about Gu Caiwei, Li Qingyun sighed endlessly. He never imagined that Gu Caiwei would have such an extraordinary background.
 He did not expect her to shoulder the lives and fates of countless living beings in this world.
 “Caiwei, if I’m not wrong, Young Master Qing Ye, who led the demons to attack the seven Holy Lands, is from your Flower Realm, right?” Li Qingyun guessed Young Master Qing Ye’s background.
 “Yes. Qing Ye hopes to reshape the order of the Jingxing Realm and weaken the power of the seven Holy Lands so that the demons can control this world. Only then can we rest assured and bring the living beings of our Flower Realm into this world to fight for a place to live! Otherwise, they will definitely die under the swords of the various Holy Lands!” Gu Caiwei said seriously.
 Li Qingyun nodded. As a human, he was furious about the battle between humans and demons started by Young Master Qing Ye.
 However, from Gu Caiwei’s point of view, she could understand their worries and actions.
 The seven Holy Lands called themselves the orthodox path, and they could not tolerate dissidents. The living beings of the Flower Realm were all demons in their eyes, and Gu Caiwei was one of them.
  She was originally a kind person, but she was treated as a target by the various Holy Lands. They even wanted to eliminate her, forcing her and Li Qingyun to fall in love and not stay together.
 She definitely hated the Holy Land.
 Young Master Qing Ye was taking revenge for Gu Caiwei and suppressing the power of the seven Holy Lands.
 “Once all the living beings of our world migrate here… I’ll be free!” A bitter smile surfaced on Gu Caiwei’s lips.
 Li Qingyun looked at Gu Caiwei and pondered for a moment before asking, “Caiwei, can I go to the Flower Realm to take a look?”
     

 “There’s nothing to see. Oh yes, bring me to see your sect!” Gu Caiwei changed the topic.
 Li Qingyun knew that the matter was definitely not as simple as Gu Caiwei made it out to be. Furthermore, for some reason, he felt that Gu Caiwei was not here to reunite with him today. Instead, she seemed to be here to bid him farewell.
 In the Primordial Dao Holy Land, Dao Yanzi, who had also been defeated by Young Master Qing Ye and was restrained by the vines, shouted angrily, “Young Master Qing Ye, do you really want to become enemies with our Primordial Dao Immortal Sect?”
 When he saw the True Immortal Guo Shengxiu captured by Young Master Qing Ye earlier, he knew that the enemy this time was much stronger than he had expected.
 The enemy the Immortal Martial World had encountered this time was really troublesome.
 He was also easily defeated by Young Master Qing Ye.
 Young Master Qing Ye did not answer Dao Yanzi. He carried Dao Yanzi and Guo Shengxiu to the altar and threw them to the ground.
 Then, he grabbed all the disciples of the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect who were hiding in the dark and bound them with vines before throwing them to the side of the altar.
 At the same time, a few figures wearing leaf totem masks appeared beside the altar.
 “Keep an eye on them. If they don’t behave, kill them directly!” Qing Ye ordered in a deep voice before his figure flashed and left the altar.
  Dao Yanzi looked at the altar again, and the ominous feeling in his heart intensified.
 Young Master Qing Ye’s occupation of the seven Holy Lands was not as simple as it seemed. He might have an even more terrifying motive.
 However, with his strength, only those top experts from the immortal sects could suppress him.
 Fortunately, he had asked Lu Yuchen to leave the Holy Land and hide elsewhere. Otherwise, they would probably be captured by Qing Ye. “Uncle-Master Dao Yanzi, we won’t die here, right?” Guo Shengxiu was a little afraid.
 He suddenly regretted coming to the lower realm. He thought that there would be no danger here.
 He did not expect to become a fish on someone’s chopping board not long after he came down.
 He might even die.
 He did not want that. Furthermore, dying in the lower realm like this was too sullen and embarrassing.
    
Chapter 210: Li Yu’s Return (2)  “Don’t worry, the Immortal Sect will send someone to save us! Qing Ye won’t dare to kill us!” Dao Yanzi pretended to be calm as he comforted Guo Shengxiu and the others.
 However, he was well aware that they were about to die.
 Lu Yuchen would probably find out soon that they had been defeated by Young Master Qing Ye.
 Then, they would return to the Immortal Domain as agreed and request the immortal sects to send more experts down.
 However, he had a feeling that there was no time left. The few of them were probably going to become the sacrificial offerings of the altar first.
 The old Dragon King of the Azure Dragon Race, Long Guang, led his clansmen to the Primordial Dao Holy Land one after another. They had agreed to participate in the battle back then to take the Primordial Dao Holy Land for themselves.
 As for the Nine-Headed Lion Race, they were guarding the Divine Firmament Holy Land. The other races were also guarding different Holy Lands. They were in a good mood. After today, they would usher in a new era.
  A world ruled by the demon race was known as the demon era.
 Under the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree, Young Master Qing Ye’s feet took root and fused with the roots of the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree, constantly absorbing its vitality.
 The ancient tree rapidly began to wither, and its leaves fell one after another. Its Dao Fortune slowly dissipated, and it finally became a withered old tree.
 Then, Young Master Qing Ye bowed deeply to the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree.
 …
 In the Black Mist Mountain Range, in the ruins of the Limitless Holy Land. Everyone from the Clear Void Holy Land was still nervously searching for the spatial overlap point. They searched from day to night.
     

 It was not until dawn that they finally found the intersection point. They quickly set up the array formation and prepared to activate the teleportation array.
 “Everyone, activate the array formation!” Perfected Zi Xu ordered with a grave expression.
 The other elders and disciples present were also nervous. Whether they could bring back the cultivators from the Lingtian Mystic Realm depended on the current situation.
 At the same time, everyone in the Lingtian Mystic Realm was anxiously waiting for the Immortal Martial World’s response. They went from hope to disappointment, and from disappointment to despair.
 At the moment, Li Yu was searching for a solution… the origin of the world.
 He had already sent Long Yue to find the Azure Dragon Race to see if they could return to the Immortal Martial World through the demon race’s teleportation array.
 However, the news Long Yue brought back made Li Yu’s heart heavier, and there was no response from the Dragon Palace.
 This confirmed to Li Yu that something had really happened in the Immortal Martial World.
 Therefore, his only hope seemed to be the source of the world he had obtained.
 According to the system’s introduction of the world’s origin, Li Yu felt that if he could completely fuse with and grasp this origin power, he might be able to find a way to leave this place.
 However, the fusion process was slow. The system indicated that this power was complicated and powerful. It would probably take at least a few days to fully fuse it.
 However, just as everyone was getting anxious like ants on a hot pan, Perfected Taiqing and the elders of the Clear Void Holy Land shouted in joy, “There’s a response! There’s a response!”
 They held special magic artifacts in their hands. They were magic artifacts that activated the spatial teleportation array, and they flickered with a halo.
 Everyone was overjoyed when they heard the news and looked at Perfected Taiqing and the others with anticipation.
 “Quick, activate the teleportation array and establish a stable spatial passageway!” Perfected Tian Hui shouted.
 Everyone from the Clear Void Holy Land quickly activated the teleportation array with their magic artifacts and successfully established a stable teleportation passageway.
     

 “Li Yu, come with us first!” Perfected Tian Hui said.
 Li Yu did not hesitate. He was in a hurry to return and see what was going on, so he immediately followed the Holy Lords into the teleportation array.
 Meanwhile, in the Primordial Dao Holy Land. Young Master Qing Ye looked at the dawn sky and said, “It’s time!”
 Before he finished his sentence, he had already arrived in the air. He formed hand seals with both hands, and golden leaves flew out of his body.
 A halo appeared on the leaves, and runes flickered, emitting an extraordinary aura.
 “Open!” Young Master Qing Ye shouted. All the leaves instantly flew into the distance, and one of them instantly fused into the altar of the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 In an instant, the altar glowed brightly as energy ripples spread out. Strange totems surfaced above the altar.
 At the same time, the phantom of a gigantic ancient green tree surfaced on the altar. Its thick roots were like flood dragons that pierced deep into the earth vein.
 The tall tree trunk pierced into the clouds, and the lush leaves were like clouds that covered half of the sky.
 “What’s going on?”
 “Young Master Qing Ye activated that altar!”
  Everyone from the Azure Dragon Race in the Primordial Dao Holy Land looked at the towering tree that had suddenly appeared in surprise.
 The old Dragon King, Long Guang, frowned slightly. This altar seemed to be inconsistent with the situation described by Young Master Qing Ye.
 However, as he was thinking, Long Guang’s expression suddenly changed. His body suddenly froze as golden light shot out from his body. A strange power surged madly in his body as if it was about to explode.
 “Seed! It’s that seed!” Long Guang shouted in horror. He remembered the so-called immortal seed that Young Master Qing Ye had given them back then that could improve their strength and physique.
 “It’s over. We’ve been tricked!” Long Guang seemed to understand something. Young Master Qing Ye did not seem to want the demon race to dominate the Immortal Martial World.
 They were just pawns in a scheme. They might even be his prey.
 Fear, anger, unwillingness, anger, and roars filled his heart, but he could not make a sound. His body was already completely dominated by that strange power and could not be controlled.
 After a moment, Long Guang’s body stood on the spot in an almost strange posture. His feet were rooted into the ground, and his hands were raised above his head, turning into branches filled with leaves.
    
Chapter 211: Li Yu’s Return (3)  His face was facing the sky, and his seven orifices were open. Branches covered in leaves grew out.
 A dazzling golden halo emitted from the leaf and gathered in the sky.
 It was not only Long Guang. Everyone from the Azure Dragon Race in the Primordial Dao Holy Land, as well as the Nine-Headed Lion Race, the Golden Feather Race, the Demon Fox Race, and other demons in the various Holy Lands, were also present.
 There were also many greater demons and even some human cultivators in the Grand Desolate Forest, the Black Mist Mountain Range, the Endless Sea, and the Huaxia continent.
 Their bodies turned into strange trees.
 “Oh no, that Young Master Qing Ye is up to something!” Dao Yanzi, who was imprisoned beside the altar, felt his heart sink when he saw the changes in the altar and the few Azure Dragons not far away.
 He felt that the thing he was most worried about was about to happen. Furthermore, the reality might be worse than he had feared.
     

  Although he did not know what Young Master Qing Ye was up to, it was definitely not something good. It would probably threaten the lives of the entire Immortal Martial World.
 “What are you doing?” Dao Yanzi looked at the masked figures at the side and shouted.
 However, those people did not answer. They did not even move as if nothing around them existed.
 As countless golden lights gathered in the sky from all over the world, an enormous ancient tree slowly appeared in the sky. It hung upside down in the sky, and its golden leaves kept absorbing the golden halos that flew over from below.
 The roots spread to the entire sky. Countless roots seemed to interweave into a large net that enveloped the entire world.
 Immediately, the color of the sky changed. The light in the entire world seemed to be absorbed by the giant tree hanging upside down in the sky. The world fell into darkness, and a terrifying pressure instantly enveloped the entire world.
 Everyone looked at the giant tree in the sky in horror. Their hearts trembled, but they did not know what was going on.
 In the next second, the ground began to tremble violently as the power of heaven and earth began to surge towards the giant tree.
 A strange power spread out from the void, instantly engulfing all the living beings in the world. The power transformed into an invisible devouring power that began to extract the vitality in their bodies.
 “Not good! Young Master Qing Ye is trying to devour the vitality of the entire Immortal Martial World!” Dao Yanzi was shocked. The situation was indeed worse than he had feared.
 Young Master Qing Ye did have a bigger scheme. He actually wanted to devour the vitality of a world. This guy was simply crazy.
     

 If he could not be stopped, all the living beings in this Immortal Martial World would have their vitality devoured and die.
 The vitality and spiritual energy of the entire Immortal Martial World would be devoured, dried up, and eventually reduced to a lifeless wasteland.
 “It’s over. The Immortal Martial World is really in trouble!” Dao Yanzi’s face was ashen with despair.
 It seemed like no one could stop Young Master Qing Ye’s scheme anymore. It was too late for the Immortal Domain to send anyone.
 Only death awaited the Immortal Martial World. He never imagined that the Immortal Martial World would face such a desperate situation one day.
 “Uncle-Master, I don’t want to die!” Sensing the vitality in his body being sucked away, Guo Shengxiu was horrified. He struggled with all his might, but he could not break free from the restraints of the vines.
  “Bastard, this lunatic, demon, great devil, you will suffer the wrath of heaven!” Guo Shengxiu roared to vent the fear in his heart.
 However, the masked people around him still had no reaction as they watched everything coldly.
 At this moment, the giant tree hanging in the sky was like a greedy demon that kept devouring the vitality of the entire Immortal Martial World.
 The shadow of death enveloped the entire Immortal Martial World, and countless living beings fell into panic. They could feel their vitality being constantly extracted, but they were helpless.
 Countless human cultivators and greater demons rushed into the sky, wanting to destroy the giant tree hanging in the sky.
 However, they could not even move a leaf.
 Despair, horror, and death. All the negative emotions gathered into dark clouds that could not see the sun. They enveloped everyone’s hearts, pressing down on them until they could not breathe.
 The entire world seemed to have fallen into an unprecedented desperate situation.
    
Chapter 212 Possession of the Whole World
 The Black Mist Mountain Range, at the ruins of the Limitless Holy Land.
 Perfected Tian Hui, Perfected Qing Xiao, Perfected Biyao, Perfected Taiqing, and the other Holy Lords were the first to return to the Immortal Martial World through the teleportation array with Li Yu.
 Everyone immediately learned what had happened in the Holy Land from Perfected Zi Xu. They were furious and shocked.
 “Those despicable demons actually dared to do such an intolerable thing. To think that we left a place for them when our human race was at its peak. We’ve really raised a tiger to bring calamity!”
 “Animals are animals. They’re inhumane even if they become human in appearance!”
 “This time, we must make the demons pay the price for their sins!” Everyone was furious. Although they were more or less mentally prepared earlier, they still could not suppress the grief and indignation in their hearts when they heard the painful truth.
 “Is our Qingyun Sect alright?” Li Yu asked worriedly.
  “The main targets of the demons this time are the various Holy Lands. The Qingyun Sect should be fine!” Perfected Zi Xu said.
 Li Yu secretly heaved a sigh of relief, but he could not stand by and do nothing about this matter. The orthodox sects of the human race were irreconcilable. If they did not eliminate Young Master Qing Ye and defeat the various demons, their Qingyun Sect would definitely not be able to rest in peace.
 This was similar to the situation in the Great Xia Dynasty back then. The world’s vastness could allow the sect to develop better.
 Moreover, Li Yu, who was born in a peaceful country in his previous life, liked the peaceful atmosphere and did not like to see the world in chaos.
 Whoever dared to cause trouble would be destroyed.
 As everyone spoke, the color of the sky changed, and space shook. A gigantic ancient green tree appeared from the depths of the Black Mist Mountain Range and pierced into the clouds.
 Everyone was like birds startled by the twang of a bow, and a chill ran down their spines. There must be a reason for this abnormality. The sudden appearance of this towering tree gave them a bad feeling.
 Indeed, before long, countless golden lights gathered in the sky. An enormous ancient tree slowly appeared in the sky, hanging upside down. Its golden leaves kept absorbing the golden halos that flew over from below.
 Countless roots interwoven into a gigantic dome that enveloped the entire sky.
 At the same time, a terrifying devouring power instantly enveloped them and began to devour the surrounding plants and everyone’s vitality.
 Some weeds instantly withered, flowers withered, and leaves turned yellow.
     

 “Oh no, that’s really his goal!” Perfected Tian Hui exclaimed, and the expressions of the other Holy Lords changed drastically.
 “That guy attacked the seven Holy Lands for the natural spirit veins where our Holy Lands are located. He’s going to devour our world’s spirit veins and vitality!”
 Perfected Tian Hui guessed Young Master Qing Ye’s true motive and could not help but feel even more shocked.
 They had thought that this fellow only wanted to rule the Immortal Martial World and establish his own faction in the lower realm.
 e
 a
 However, they did not expect him to have a greater and more shocking scheme.
 He was using the Heaven and Earth Spirit Vein to set up a Heaven and Earth Array to devour the vitality and spirit veins of the entire Immortal Martial World.
 He must have come prepared for such a big scheme, and he was not alone.
 It was likely that the various demons were only his pawns. Once the Heaven and Earth Array was activated, those demons would definitely not escape death.
 Therefore, the situation was far more serious and dangerous than they had previously thought.
  Li Yu’s expression changed slightly when he heard Perfected Tian Hui’s words. He did not expect the matter to be more serious than he had imagined. This fellow called Qing Ye was simply insane.
 Swoosh!
 Li Yu pulled out his sword again and stomped his feet. His figure soared into the sky and flew towards the giant tree hanging upside down in the sky before slashing out.
 Blast!
 The sword seemed to split the world apart. As the sword might swept through, space twisted violently. The towering tree hanging in the sky collapsed with the entire sky.
 Upon seeing this, the expressions of Perfected Tian Hui, Perfected Qing Xiao, and the others tensed up as they looked at the sky nervously.
 Having witnessed the might of Li Yu’s sword reconstructing the world, they hoped that Li Yu could turn the tide.
 At the same time, countless humans, demons, and other creatures saw the scene in the sky. They were shocked to see the giant tree collapse, but they were also delighted to survive.
     

 Furthermore, as the giant tree collapsed, the devouring power weakened significantly.
 “It worked?” Everyone was excited.
 However, in the next second, as the sky healed, the collapsed ancient tree condensed again.
 Everyone’s hearts sank to the bottom again.
 “It can’t be destroyed!” Li Yu frowned. This Heaven and Earth Array was not simple.
 He looked at the towering tree growing in the depths of the Black Mist Mountain Range and pondered.
 It was clear that the giant tree was likely the foundation of the Heaven and Earth Array. The various Holy Lands probably had such a tree too. It seemed like he had to think of a way to destroy the array foundations at the same time.
 He quickly took out the Mi Lu Immortal Palace and called everyone out. Even the divine beast Qilin was called out.
 After all, this concerned the survival of the entire Immortal Martial World. Everyone had to gather their strength to save the world.
 Everyone was stunned by the scene before them, especially You Rong. The expression on her face was more shocked and complicated than anyone else.
 She knew those giant trees and who had done all of this.
 ‘What is Uncle Qing Ye doing?!’ You Rong exclaimed in her mind.
 “Feng Xian, do you have a way to break this Heaven and Earth Array?” Li Yu asked. He knew that Feng Xian was an expert in array formations.
 However, after Feng Xian saw the situation in front of him, his expression became extremely grave. Immediately, he shook his head and said, “This isn’t a Heaven and Earth Array. It’s a spell. It’s like a kind of possession ritual. Cultivators possess the bodies of others, and this spell takes over the Immortal Martial World. Moreover, this ritual has already reached the last step. It’s like the process of the soul fusing with a new body. It can’t be forcefully stopped unless the Immortal Martial World is destroyed too!”
  Feng Xian’s words made Li Yu and everyone present despair.
 “Of course, there’s another way. We can capture the caster and make him stop this spell. This might be our only hope!” Feng Xian added.
 “Then we can only find Young Master Qing Ye!” Li Yu said in a low voice.
 “Perfected Zi Xu, do you know where Young Master Qing Ye is?” Li Yu asked Perfected Zi Xu.
 “His whereabouts are mysterious, and I can’t be sure either. However, I speculate that he might be in the Primordial Dao Holy Land. That’s because Young Master Qing Ye must have cast this spell after reclaiming the Primordial Dao Holy Land!” Perfected Zi Xu said.
 Li Yu nodded. He had no other choice but to think of a way to find Young Master Qing Ye.
 “Come, let’s go to the Primordial Dao Holy Land!” Li Yu said.
 Behind him, You Rong hesitated to speak. She looked at the giant tree hanging upside down in the sky with a complicated expression and muttered in her mind, ‘Uncle Qing Ye, are you doing this to save our Flower Realm? But this is too cruel!’
    
Chapter 213: Qing Ye  Li Yu rode the divine beast Qilin and carried his junior brother, the Holy Lords, Perfected Zi Xu, and the others towards the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 The divine beast Qilin’s flying speed was extremely fast. It could shrink the ground to an inch and arrive in an instant.
 When Li Yu and the others arrived at the Primordial Dao Holy Land, the scene before them deeply shocked them.
 On the main peak of the Holy Land, thousands of Azure Dragon clansmen stood there in a strange posture. Their faces were facing the sky, and their hands were extended into the air.
 Their bodies seemed to have been possessed by trees. Countless branches extended from their bodies, and even branches grew out of their nostrils, eyes, and mouths. They looked miserable.
 Although everyone was shocked by this scene, they felt that these demons deserved it and did not show any mercy.
 However, Long Yue, who came along, felt as if she was struck by lightning and almost fell to the ground.
  Those people were her clansmen!
 Young Master Qing Ye was indeed still in the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
 A trace of surprise flashed through his eyes when he saw Li Yu appear here.
 He did not expect Li Yu to have already come out of the mystic realm. Fortunately, his plan was implemented in time. Otherwise, it might have been for naught.
 However, he did not care anymore. He was not even afraid of death, so what was there to be afraid of?
 Therefore, his expression remained calm as his figure flashed into the air. He looked at Li Yu and said, “If you’re here to stop me, I advise you not to waste your energy. Even if you kill me, it won’t change anything. This technique won’t stop!”
 Li Yu’s expression turned cold when he heard Qing Ye’s words. If not for the fact that this person was the only way to break through the barrier, he would have definitely killed him with a single strike.
 
 Suddenly, the mission interface popped up in front of Li Yu. The mission content was to stop Qing Ye’s scheme.
 Furthermore, the system mission gave some guidelines and detailed introductions regarding Qing Ye.
 Flower Realm Tree God?
 Li Yu was shocked. He did not expect the person in front of him to have such an extraordinary background.
     

 After Li Yu finished reading the detailed introduction of Qing Ye, he seemed to understand what he wanted to do.
 Just as Li Yu was checking the information given by the system, You Rong suddenly rushed out and asked with a grave expression, “Uncle Qing Ye, why did you do that?”
 Seeing You Rong, Qing Ye’s expression changed slightly. “Girl, why are you here? Come here quickly!”
 “Uncle Qing Ye?” Upon hearing You Rong’s words, Feng Xian, Ye Qiu, Long Yue, Perfected Tian Hui, Perfected Zi Xu, and the others looked at You Rong in surprise.
 He did not expect that this little girl who followed Li Yu here knew Young Master Qing Ye.
 “Uncle Qing Ye, does the Realm Master know about this?” You Rong asked.
 Young Master Qing Ye shook his head. “No, this is my own idea!”
 “Uncle Qing Ye, you’ll kill many people like this. The Realm Master will definitely be furious if he finds out. Please stop. Don’t kill the innocent!” You Rong said anxiously.
 She knew that Qing Ye was trying to save the Flower Realm. The Flower Realm was already on the verge of withering, and countless living beings had already died.
 Furthermore, if the Flower Realm was destroyed, the Realm Master who had already fused with the Flower Realm would die along with it.
 Qing Ye could not bear to see their Realm Master die, nor could he bear to see the Flower Realm disappear completely.
 That was their home!
 However, You Rong felt that it was too cruel to harm another world for their world.
 If the Realm Master knew, she would rather die than allow Qing Ye to do such a heinous thing.
 “For the Flower Realm, I’m willing to become this sinner. Even if I’m consigned to eternal damnation after my death, even if the heavens execute me, I’m willing to bear it. I can’t watch the Realm Master die. I can’t watch our Flower Realm disappear and all the living beings of the Flower Realm die!” Qing Ye’s voice was powerful and firm.
 From the day he began this plan, he had already mentally prepared himself to become the executioner of all lifeforms and become a terrifying demon.
 He was willing to do anything for his home, the world he had lived in for hundreds of millions of years.
 Furthermore, their plan had already reached the final step. As long as they successfully devoured the spirit veins and vitality of the Immortal Martial World, they could save the entire Flower Realm.
 Once the Flower Realm recovered and the Realm Master returned to the Sovereign Realm in the future, he could bring the Flower Realm back to the Nine Heavens to take revenge on their enemies.
 “Selfish fellow, can you bear to see the living beings of our Immortal Martial World become sacrifices for your Flower Realm!” Perfected Tian Hui berated angrily.
 Although he was surprised by the man’s identity, he could not understand his actions. After all, they were on different sides.
 “There is life and there is death. For the sake of the Flower Realm, we can only sacrifice your world! Furthermore, without the protection of me and the creatures of the Flower Realm, your world would have been destroyed by the devils from the Lingtian Mystic Realm a thousand years ago!”
     

 “Uncle Qing Ye, you can’t do that!” You Rong persuaded.
 However, Young Master Qing Ye shook his head slightly, his gaze still firm.
 Perfected Tian Hui, Perfected Taiqing, Perfected Zixu, and the others looked at each other with worried brows.
 Since Qing Ye was so determined, it was probably impossible to end this spell.
 “Little girl, you’re also from the Flower Realm. Hurry up and find your Realm Master for help! Don’t let Qing Ye make a big mistake!” Perfected Tian Hui had an idea and looked at You Rong.
 “That’s right. Kid, bring us along. Let us have a good chat with your Realm Master. Perhaps there’s a better way!” Perfected Qing Xiao hurriedly added.
 They felt that the best solution now was to negotiate peacefully. Even a compromise was better than the entire Immortal Martial World facing a hopeless situation.
 They were not afraid of death, but they did not want their home to become a wasteland either. They did not want to see the extinction of all life in the world.
 You Rong pondered for a moment and felt that it made sense. She had to let the Realm Master know about this and let her decide.
 “Okay!” You Rong nodded. However, as soon as she finished her sentence, a wisp of golden light shot out of You Rong’s body and instantly transformed into countless vines that bound You Rong’s body.
 You Rong’s expression changed. She wanted to struggle but could not move. She could not even make a sound.
 Upon seeing this, the expressions of everyone present changed. Their last hope was about to be destroyed by Qing Ye.
 However, right at this moment, Li Yu suddenly moved. He slashed out, and Qing Ye’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly retreated, but he could not dodge Li Yu’s sword might.
 His body seemed to be locked onto by a powerful law.
 Under that law, all his abilities and magic power were useless, and his body was destroyed by the law uncontrollably.
 Qing Ye looked at Li Yu in surprise. Although he knew that Li Yu was strong, he did not expect him to be stronger than he had expected.
 Blast!
  Qing Ye’s body instantly collapsed, turning into countless leaves, powder, and finally into green smoke that dissipated.
 “Cultivator Li, you…” Everyone’s expression changed drastically as they looked at Li Yu in surprise.
 Qing Ye was the key to stopping this spell. If he killed him, wouldn’t that mean that no one could stop this spell?
 “This isn’t his main body. Come, let’s go to the Flower Realm!” Li Yu said. He had already found a way to save the Immortal Martial World through the information in the system mission.
 As Qing Ye’s incarnation collapsed, the power restraining You Rong instantly disappeared.
 Dao Yanzi, Guo Shengxiu, and the others, who were restrained by the vines by the altar below, regained their freedom.
 Meanwhile, the masked figures at the side rapidly withered and finally turned into lifeless wooden figures.
 …
    
Chapter 214: May the Sea of Flowers Bloom Again (1)  “I’m saved! This is great!” Guo Shengxiu was overjoyed, even though his vitality was still being absorbed by the invisible devouring power.
 However, compared to being imprisoned on the spot and waiting for death, obtaining freedom naturally gave him more options.
 Furthermore, as long as they were willing, they could leave the lower realm at any time and return to the Immortal Domain to avoid the calamity here.
 “Tian Hui!” Dao Yanzi shouted as he led everyone from the Primordial Dao Sect to rapidly fly into the sky to meet Li Yu and the others.
 “Patriarch?” Perfected Tian Hui was shocked to see the person flying over.
 Although he had never seen Dao Yanzi before, all the elders in the Holy Land who had ascended to the Immortal Domain had statues and images, so he recognized that the person in front of him was their patriarch, Perfected Dao Yanzi.
 He did not expect the Patriarch to come down to help the Primordial Dao Holy Land.
  Guo Shengxiu, who was following behind Dao Yanzi, looked at Li Yu and the divine beast Qilin behind him with reverence.
 He had seen Li Yu kill Qing Ye with a single strike.
 He had experienced Young Master Qing Ye’s strength before. With his cultivation and strength, he was not his match.
 It was clear that he was at least a Golden Immortal or even a Heaven Immortal.
 Even in the Desolate Heaven Immortal Domain, he could be considered an overlord.
 However, such a peerless expert had been killed by this young man with a single strike. It was truly terrifying.
     

 What was even more unbelievable was that he had just seen Li Yu riding the divine beast Qilin here.
 
 The divine beast Qilin was a powerful existence. In the Desolate Heaven Immortal Domain, only a saint or the son of a top ancient family could subdue such a powerful divine beast as a mount.
 Was this person a saint from some ancient family?
 Guo Shengxiu guessed in his mind. He did not expect that even the saints of the ancient families would come down to help. It seemed that the Jingxing Realm was not simple.
 “Uncle-Master Dao Yanzi, I’ll go find Junior Sister Lu first. Take care!” Guo Shengxiu did not want to take the risk anymore. He was also in a hurry to find Lu Li so that he could bring her back to the Immortal Domain.
 “Alright, you may go!” said Dao Yanzi.
 Guo Shengxiu left quickly while Li Yu led everyone deeper into the Black Mist Mountain Range.
 According to the system mission’s directions, he could find the Flower Realm’s entrance even without You Rong’s guidance.
 However, You Rong around, it saved him a lot of trouble.
 The entrance to the Flower Realm was located in a canyon in the depths of the Black Mist Mountain Range. The fog there was so dense that no one could see their surroundings clearly.
 They could not use their divine sense either. Even their vision and hearing were affected to a certain extent.
 If not for the system’s guidance or someone familiar leading the way, they would probably lose their way and be trapped here forever.
 No wonder the core area of the Black Mist Mountain Range had always been called a forbidden area for humans. No one had stepped foot here.
 …
 The Flower Realm, a world filled with vitality, flowers, and trees, was now bleak and desolate.
     

 The withered mountain range was filled with a deathly aura. Withered trees stood on the dry ground like dried corpses that had died of thirst in the desert.
 The entire world seemed like a wasteland with no end in sight.
 Only in the middle of the Flower Realm was an oasis that was less than a thousandth of the entire world.
 It was as if the last candle in the endless darkness was swaying in the wind as if it would extinguish at any moment.
 In the oasis, Gu Caiwei looked at Qing Ye with a serious expression and said, “Qing Ye, let go. Don’t make any more mistakes!”
 Qing Ye lowered his head and remained silent. He did not even dare to look at Gu Caiwei.
 He did not expect Gu Caiwei’s incarnation to leave the Flower Realm and learn of his plan.
 This was the last situation he wanted to face.
 He knew that Gu Caiwei was kind-hearted, and everything he did went against her wishes.
 Therefore, he planned to keep it from her until everything was over. He was willing to apologize with his life and bear all the infamy alone.
 However, things did not go according to plan. He had no choice but to face Gu Caiwei now. He had no choice but to see the disappointment in her eyes and the interrogation of his conscience.
  “Realm Master, please forgive Qing Ye for taking the initiative. I’m willing to die to atone for my sins. As long as you and the Flower Realm can survive, I won’t hesitate even if my soul dissipates and I can never reincarnate!” Qing Ye lowered his head and said.
 Li Qingyun stood at the side and watched everything that happened with mixed feelings. He knew that perhaps only Gu Caiwei could stop Qing Ye and save the Immortal Martial World.
 “Qing Ye, if you do this, even if you save me and the Flower Realm, I will live in self-blame and sin for the rest of my life. We shouldn’t let innocent creatures suffer for us!” Gu Caiwei added.
 Immediately, she stepped forward and grabbed Qing Ye’s hand. She said earnestly, “Uncle Qing Ye, you watched me grow up. You taught me many of my Dao techniques. To me, you’re like a father and a brother. I know you can’t bear to see me and the Flower Realm perish.”
 “However, you should understand me. You know that I won’t be happy doing this. Even if I live ignobly, I can only live in pain and self-blame. Can you bear to see me lose my smile forever?”
 Gu Caiwei’s words struck the heart, causing Qing Ye’s firm heart to waver.
 He knew Gu Caiwei very well. As Gu Caiwei had said, he had watched her grow up. To be precise, he had watched many living beings in the Flower Realm grow up.
 It was because of this that he had deeper feelings for the Flower Realm and this group of creatures.
    
Chapter 215: May the Sea of Flowers Bloom Again (2)  He could not remember how many years he had lived. Perhaps a hundred million years or more.
 Ever since he had consciousness, he had silently guarded this land and the living beings here. He watched them grow and become extraordinary experts.
 He loved this land and their home, and he was more willing to give up everything for it.
 They were also willing to contribute selflessly to the living beings here.
 Therefore, all the new children in the Flower Realm would affectionately call him Uncle Qing Ye.
 Even Gu Caiwei had addressed him this way before she became the Realm Master.
 Suddenly, Gu Caiwei’s eyes flashed. She turned to look into the distance and said in a low voice, “They’re already here!”
  Before he finished his sentence, Li Yu and the others arrived at the oasis under You Rong’s lead.
 “Dad, why are you here?” Li Yu was surprised to see Li Qingyun here. Moreover, his father did not seem to be in danger.
 “Yu’er, when did you guys return?” Li Qingyun was also surprised. He thought that Li Yu was still in the Lingtian Mystic Realm, but he did not expect him to be back already.
 Gu Caiwei looked at Li Yu carefully. Although this was the first time she had seen him, it was not the first time she had heard his name.
 He knew that Li Yu was actually an abandoned baby Li Qingyun had picked up back then. It was also Li Yu’s appearance that changed Li Qingyun’s life at that time.
 Furthermore, according to Li Qingyun, they might be from the same world. It was the heavens that made them meet, and it was the heavens that sent them to save him.
 If not for Li Yu, Li Qingyun might have already spent his life in depression.
     

 
 “It’s a long story!” Li Qingyun replied.
 “Then we’ll talk about it later!” replied Li Yu.
 Then, he turned to look at Qing Ye and said coldly, “Qing Ye, stop the spell immediately. Otherwise, I’ll destroy this dilapidated Flower Realm of yours. You should know that I have the ability!”
 As he spoke, Li Yu drew the sword on his back.
 Although he was shocked when he saw the Flower Realm on his way here, he also felt some pity.
 However, now that the Flower Realm and the Immortal Martial World were in a dead-or-alive relationship, he sympathized with but would not pity them.
 “Qing Ye, stop!” Gu Caiwei said earnestly.
 “Uncle Qing Ye!” You Rong looked at Qing Ye pleadingly.
 Qing Ye’s gaze wandered as he struggled bitterly in his heart. He was not a bad person by nature, and he knew that he had done something wrong.
 However, he had once chosen the latter between his conscience and the Flower Realm.
 Furthermore, he knew that he could not be that cruel to separate a rational clone to complete the plan in his place.
 Now that his incarnation had been killed by Li Yu, his main body could not be that cold-blooded.
 Li Yu looked at Qing Ye coldly and raised the sword in his hand. Qing Ye looked at Li Yu and the sword. He did not doubt Li Yu’s ability.
 He just did not expect that You Rong would know Li Yu, nor did he expect that she would really bring Li Yu and the others here.
 Perhaps everything was fated. He wanted to defy the heavens, but he did not succeed in the end.
 Faced with Li Yu’s sword and Gu Caiwei’s gaze, he had no other choice.
     

 “I… will stop the spell!” Qing Ye closed his eyes in despair and said with a sorrowful expression.
 …
 In the Immortal Martial World, a strange power constantly devoured everyone’s vitality.
 Countless unwilling human cultivators were still attempting to destroy the giant tree, but they returned empty-handed.
 Many greater demons even spontaneously organized to attack the towering trees growing in the Grand Desolate Forest and the Black Mist Mountain Range, hoping to stop everything.
 However, the giant tree hanging in the sky was like the door to hell, constantly devouring the entire world and taking everyone’s lives.
 The end of the world had already arrived. Death was incomparably real and clear in front of them. They could not escape or break free.
 Be it men, women, young, old, young, rich, poor, birds, beasts, flowers, and trees…
 All that awaited them was death.
 At this moment, everyone fell into deep despair.
 At the border of the Great Sui Dynasty, the two armies that were fighting had already thrown down their weapons and rushed to their countries.
 They wanted to reunite with their families before they died. Even if they could not return, they wanted to die on the land they were familiar with.
 In the imperial capital, two young men hugged their heads and cried.
  They had just become sworn brothers not long ago, and they had set up their grand wish to die on the same day.
 They did not expect their wish to come true so soon!
 On the street, a miserly merchant broke down. He hugged a box filled with gold, silver, and treasures and sat paralyzed in the middle of the road. As he threw out gold, silver, and jewelry, he wailed to the sky, “Oh heavens, I’m willing to spend all my wealth. Please let us off!”
 At the door of a restaurant by the street, two burly men with rough faces stood side by side. One of them said earnestly, “Ah Gang, I’ve always wanted to tell you something, but I didn’t have the courage in the past.
 “Do you know why I haven’t had any children after being married to Little Cui for so many years? Because the person I like is actually you!”
 Ah Gang: “…”
 In a residence in the east of the city, a young and beautiful woman walked to the bed of an old man and said, “Master, I have a secret that I have to tell you now!”
 “Actually, Lu Mao isn’t your son. He’s the son of Lord Wang next door! I’m sorry, but you won’t have any descendants in this life!”
    
Chapter 216: May the Sea of Flowers Bloom Again (3)
 “I originally planned to bring this secret into the coffin, but now that the end of the world has arrived, none of us can escape. I think we should let you die in peace! It was not in vain for you to marry me back then!”
 “You, you!” The old man was so angry that his entire body was trembling. However, he was already sick and bedridden and did not have much time left. Now that the vitality in his body had been devoured, he was even weaker and did not even have the strength to speak.
 “Help, help!” He shouted with difficulty. However, the servants had already fled.
 The remaining few were already lying on the ground in despair, waiting for death.
 No one listened to his orders.
 In a farmhouse in the outskirts of the city, a terrified woman leaned on her husband’s shoulder as tears streamed down her face. The man comforted her softly.
 His six-year-old son did not know what was going on. He looked at his father and asked, “Dad, Mom said that we would all die. What will happen if we die?”
  “If you die, you’ll sleep forever!” The man patted the boy’s head and smiled.
 “Will you dream then?” the boy asked again.
 “Yes, and it will always be a beautiful dream. There will be no nightmares. In the dream, Dad and Mom will be with you. We will live in a world where there is plenty of good food and fun. We will be carefree, have no illnesses, and have no deaths. We will be happy together forever!”
 “Really? That’s great. As long as I can be with my parents, I’m not afraid of anything!”
     

 In a certain sect.
 “Master, is there really no hope? Can we only wait for death?”
 
 “Unless a miracle occurs!”
 Before he finished his sentence, the world shook. The enormous ancient tree that was hanging in the sky suddenly disappeared slowly. It was as if dark clouds had dispersed, and sunlight instantly enveloped the earth.
 The life-devouring power disappeared as well. The entire world seemed to have instantly returned to heaven from hell.
 …
 In the only remaining oasis in the Flower Realm, after Qing Ye stopped his spell, he formed a few complicated hand seals.
 At the same time, golden light flourished around him as his body began to become illusory.
 Upon seeing this, Gu Caiwei’s expression changed as she cried out, “Qing Ye, no!”
 “Realm Master, I’m sorry. I can’t protect you and the Flower Realm anymore. I hope that my life can buy you and the Flower Realm more time.”
 “Although I don’t know what the future holds, I hope that one day, the sea of flowers in the Flower Realm can bloom again!”
     

 With that, Qing Ye closed his eyes.
 He seemed to see the Flower Realm that was once filled with life.
 It was as if he saw himself as a child, running on the grass without any worries and flying above the sea of flowers.
 A blissful smile slowly surfaced on his lips, but his body became increasingly illusory.
 In the end, it turned into countless light spots that scattered to the surrounding ground.
 In an instant, the trees that were about to wither in the distance slowly regained their vitality. Green grass grew on the originally dry ground, and many flowers bloomed in the oasis.
 “Qing Ye!” Gu Caiwei knelt on the ground, her tears falling like rain. She looked at the light spots that filled the sky in grief, and her heart felt like it was being stabbed by a knife.
 Qing Ye was a living being born with the Flower Realm.
  He had existed for countless years. He was like the guardian of the Flower Realm, silently guarding this land and all the living beings in it.
 Now, he had used his hundreds of millions of years of cultivation to turn it into vitality to give life to the dying Flower Realm.
 No one knew how long this energy could support the existence of the Flower Realm.
 However, he still protected the home he loved until the last moment of his life.
 Li Yu looked at everything that was happening and sighed endlessly in his heart.
 This was the first time he respected an enemy from the bottom of his heart, and it was also the first time he did not feel any joy after winning.
 Even though he had obtained a lot of experience points from this mission, he still could not feel happy.
 There was no winning or losing in this!
    
Chapter 217: Waking Up To Women (1)
 Qing Ye’s death gave the Flower Realm a chance to breathe again, and it also announced the end of the calamity he had caused.
 The demon race had paid a painful price for their ambition and greed. Ninety percent of the demon experts were from the Azure Dragon Race, the Nine-Headed Lion Race, the Golden Feather Race, the Phoenix Bird Race, and other large demon races.
 It was all because he had fused with the so-called immortal seed back then and became a ‘tree person’ in this calamity, becoming a sacrifice for the ritual.
 The various demons instantly fell from their former altar into the abyss.
 The strength of the race was less than ten percent, and they could not even compare to some ordinary demons.
 Of course, the human Holy Lands had also suffered heavy losses. When the various Holy Lands fought the demons, they had lost at least half of their combat strength. As for their wealth, it was even greater.
 Although the calamity was over, the scars left behind in this world needed time to heal.
  Fortunately, life was like wild grass. Even if it had been burnt by a fire, there would definitely be fresh grass and flowers everywhere one day.
 Furthermore, those who had experienced this calamity and walked through the gates of hell seemed to understand the meaning of life better. The cowardly understood courage, while the narrow-minded became calm.
 The joy of surviving the calamity temporarily dispersed the pain and gloom in people’s hearts, allowing more people to see the beauty of the sun and believe in miracles.
 “Qingyun, Caiwei, I was foolish back then. Although I can’t make up for my mistake now, I still want to apologize to the two of you!” Perfected Qing Xiao said sincerely before bowing deeply.
 Perfected Qing Xiao felt guilty towards Li Qingyun and Gu Caiwei from the bottom of his heart.
     

 
 Furthermore, judging from the current situation, as the master of the Flower Realm, Gu Caiwei had the ability and opportunity to destroy the entire human Holy Land countless times.
 However, she did not do that, even though the various Holy Lands treated her as a flower demon and wanted to get rid of her as soon as possible.
 Perfected Taiqing had a complicated expression. He wanted to step forward and say something, but he could not say it in the end.
 No one knew that he had once encountered Gu Caiwei in the past and fallen in love with that indescribably beautiful, kind, and lively woman.
 It was a pity that he was not as brave as Li Qingyun and dared to express his love.
 He was not as lucky as Li Qingyun to win Gu Caiwei’s heart.
 Furthermore, he had just become the Holy Lord at the time and cherished his status more than Li Qingyun. He hid all his feelings, so no one knew his true feelings for Gu Caiwei.
 It was also because of this that he was jealous of Li Qingyun for daring to love and hate. He was jealous that Li Qingyun could experience a passionate love with Gu Caiwei. He was jealous that Li Qingyun was braver and more carefree than him.
 Therefore, he was blinded by greed and agreed to the Divine Firmament Holy Land’s request to frame Gu Caiwei and eliminate her.
 He did kill her in name, but because of his personal feelings, he chose to capture her and suppress her in the Demon Sealing Tower.
 Everything was karma. Perhaps it was not as bad as back then. .Perhaps the Holy Land being more tolerant of Gu Caiwei back then would not make her hostile and wary of the Holy Land.
 He would not allow Qing Ye to take advantage of the Holy Land’s reputation to destroy the entire Immortal Martial World.
 Everything that happened today was karma. Everyone had suffered the karma they had planted in the past.
     

 Perfected Taiqing could only choose to seal all his emotions in his heart forever, even though he now knew that Gu Caiwei was not a demon but a flower god.
 “You guys can leave!” Gu Caiwei said sadly.
 She did not want to hear apologies, nor did she need them to apologize. She only wanted to stay here alone and guard the home that Qing Ye had exchanged his life for.
 “Let’s leave!” Perfected Tian Hui said. He knew that it was unnecessary to say anything now. They could only bear their own fruits and heal their own wounds.
 “Caiwei!” Li Qingyun wanted to stay behind and accompany Gu Caiwei. He knew that Qing Ye’s death must have been a huge blow to her.
 “You should leave too. Leave me alone!” Gu Caiwei said.
 Li Qingyun nodded and did not say anything else. He followed everyone out of the Flower Realm.
 After leaving the Flower Realm, everyone parted ways. There was a lot of mess to deal with, and they did not have the time to sigh.
 Dao Yanzi decided to return to the Immortal Domain first and report the situation here to the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect.
  Meanwhile, Li Yu brought his junior brothers and followed Li Qingyun to the Qingyun Sect.
 Li Qingyun remained silent along the way, and everyone’s hearts seemed heavy.
 “Dad, you’re amazing!” Li Yu was the first to break the silence. He knew that his father must be feeling complicated, so he decided to comfort him.
 “Of course not. If only I had half of your strength back then, so many tragic things wouldn’t have happened today!” Li Qingyun smiled bitterly.
 “You want to help the Flower Realm, right?” Li Yu asked.
 “Of course. If the Flower Realm is destroyed, your Aunt Caiwei will die. She has already died once in my life. I can’t see her die a second time!” Li Qingyun said with extreme melancholy.
 “But if you have my strength, how do you plan to help her?” Li Yu asked.
 “I heard from her that the Heaven Mending Stone and the power of the world’s origin can repair and reshape the Flower Realm! If you want to obtain the world’s origin, you need to reach the Holy Lord realm. Only then can you absorb the world’s origin energy from the Chaos Void and condense it into the true world’s origin. As for the Heaven Mending Stone, it’s something that can only be chanced upon by luck. It’s said that it once appeared in the crack of the Ten Worlds in the Chaotic Star Domain!” Li Qingyun explained.
    
Chapter 218: Waking Up To Women (2)
 “World origin? I have that!” Li Yu replied with a smile. He had just obtained world origin power from the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 “Really?” Li Qingyun’s eyes brightened, and his gloomy face immediately brightened up.
 “Of course, but I don’t have the Heaven Mending Stone. However, Dad, you have to believe in miracles. I brought back a lot of treasures and opportunities for you this time. Although I might not necessarily let you have half of my strength, I should be able to give you the strength to protect the Flower Realm!” Li Yu hugged his father and grinned.
 As a transmigrator, Li Yu knew that he had possessed an abandoned baby the moment he arrived in this world.
 Therefore, he had long known that he and Li Qingyun were not blood-related. However, this also gave him a more harmonious and intimate relationship with Li Qingyun.
 On the contrary, it would reduce the generation gap between his father and his son and increase their friendship.
 After Li Yu broke the silence, he began to talk to Li Qingyun about his time in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
  Although the Genius Excellence Rankings had already exposed a lot of content, it was only a small portion of what Li Yu had experienced.
 The atmosphere slowly eased up as they chatted. Tang Chi started the conversation while everyone began to speak.
 As they chatted, everyone returned to the Qingyun Sect.
 The disciples of the sect were pleasantly surprised to see Li Yu and the others return.
 They had guessed that Li Yu would return and turn the tide to end all of this.
     

 Now that they saw Li Yu return, they were more certain of their guess, and they were naturally overjoyed.
 
 Cheers instantly resounded through the entire mountain peak. Countless new disciples finally saw Li Yu’s true appearance, and they were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes.
 In the crowd, Lu Li stared at Li Yu with a burning gaze. The moment she saw him, it was as if a bolt of lightning had struck her heart. Electricity instantly rushed from her heart to her entire body, making her feel numb.
 She had seen various elites and extraordinary people in the Immortal Domain, although she had never seen the divine sons of those ancient families and top orthodoxies.
 However, in her opinion, she could never compare to Li Yu.
 Even if she had never seen Li Yu before, even if no one told her who he was, she locked onto Li Yu in the crowd at a glance and confirmed that he was the person she wanted to know.
 This was the owner of that human body.
 “This trip was worth it!” Lu Li said with a sweet smile.
 After returning to the sect, Li Yu and Li Qingyun arrived at the sect master hall. He gave Li Qingyun the treasures he had obtained and asked for his opinion on the distribution of the various treasures.
 Li Qingyun left behind the Heaven Earth Dao Fruit, sacred medicines, immortal pills, five paragon bones, the Roc Blood Soul, the essence of the Ancestral Magus Di Jiang, and the Primordial Chaos Qi.
 “Give the blood essence of the Responding Dragon to the purple lightning flood dragon! The blood essence of Zhurong is for Wu Chang. As for the rest, you can distribute them freely. I’ll leave this Pan Emperor’s Life Dagger and the Hunyuan Calabash for now! You can keep the rest for now!” Li Qingyun said.
 “Oh yes, Yu’er, I have two things to tell you,” Li Qingyun added.
 Li Yu looked at Li Qingyun as if he was all ears.
     

 “First, I’m preparing to change the sect’s name recently. It’s too tacky now and doesn’t match our temperament. Dad still thinks that the original name is better.”
 “However, on second thought, our sect is now worthy of being an immortal Holy Land. There are also so many immortals here. Your strength is beyond imagination, and even the Heavenly Dao Rankings can’t accurately describe it.”
 “Therefore, why don’t we change our name to:?That’s an Unimaginably Powerful and Indescribable Immortal Holy Land!?How about that? Isn’t this name grand? It also suits your temperament!
 “Also, there’s a benefit to this name. If you get on any rankings again, it might have the effect of confusing and hiding information.”
 “Dad, are you sure this name isn’t drawing hate for me? Also, can’t we come up with a more cultured name? Don’t be so straightforward. It’ll make it seem like we’re not cultured enough. People will know the content as soon as they see the name, and they won’t have the desire to continue reading!” Li Yu felt a headache coming on. He knew that nothing good would come out of hearing his father say he wanted to change his name.
 “Sigh, as the sect master, I don’t even have the right to name my sect. What a failure. I’m not fit to be the sect master…” Li Qingyun sighed at the sky.
 “Dad, I think the original name is not bad. That’s Quite a Large Sect. It’s original, not tacky, straightforward, and easy to remember!”
 “Alright, that’s what you said. Then our sect will be renamed as: That’s Quite a Large Sect!” Li Qingyun, who had his wish fulfilled, revealed a smug smile.
  “Alright, as long as you’re happy!” Li Yu could not be bothered to struggle. He knew that Li Qingyun had always been brooding over the fact that he had modified the sect’s name without permission.
 After going around in circles, he forced himself to choose his original name.
 However, Li Yu did not care much about names.
 Back then, he changed his name to adapt to this world’s literary style.
 At that time, the sect was not famous, so they could only choose to follow the trend and name it.
 It was also convenient to attract talents and recruit disciples.
 Now that his name was known throughout the world, it could be said that their sect had already led this era and opened up a new era.
 The name of the sect was no longer important.
    
Chapter 219: Waking Up To Women (3)  Even if it was called Solomon Sect, Shutter Sect, Security Sect, Seduction Sect, or Sexy Sect, it did not matter!
 There was still a large group of people kowtowing. Countless people flocked to the morning sun, wanting to enter the Qingyun Sect. Some even felt that it was awesome and clapped their hands in wonder.
 “Dad, what’s the second thing?”
 “The second thing is that I’m preparing to pass the position of sect master to you. Dad has already been surpassed by this group of disciples, so he must make the best use of his time to enter seclusion. Moreover, you young people have also grown up. It’s time to step onto the stage of history and share some of Dad’s responsibilities!” Li Qingyun said.
 “This, this is a little sudden! I…”
 “It’s time for me to pursue my own happiness!” Li Qingyun said with a smile.
 “Alright!” Li Yu knew that his father had found his true love again and was about to begin his second life. He had to fully support him.
  After discussing the future of the sect, Li Yu and Li Qingyun placed the Dao Seeking Tower on the mountain beside them. It would be the training ground for the sect’s disciples in the future.
 Li Yu arrived at the foot of the mountain and rewarded the purple lightning flood dragon with the blood essence and a few Dragon Origin Fruits.
 The purple lightning flood dragon was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes. He never dreamed that he would have the chance to transform into a True Dragon one day, nor did he expect to obtain a trace of the Responding Dragon’s bloodline.
 As Li Yu busied himself, Tang Chi became the center of attention.
     

 Like stars surrounding the moon, he was surrounded by the disciples and began to tell them about what had happened not long ago and the fortuitous encounter in the Lingtian Mystic Realm.
 It satisfied everyone’s curiosity.
 “As expected of our Eldest Senior Brother, he’s too awesome!”
 
 “What happened to the Flower Realm after that?” Everyone asked curiously.
 The main character of the story, Li Yu, returned to his courtyard.
 Shan Ruoshui was still busy in the spirit herb garden.
 A group of cats was surrounding the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree in the courtyard, basking in the sun like corpses. Their faces were filled with satisfaction and enjoyment, as if the calamity not long ago had never happened.
 Li Yu pushed open the door and walked into the room. Immediately, a fragrance assaulted his nose, and the scene in front of him stunned him. He looked at the room that looked like a woman’s boudoir and thought he had entered the wrong room.
 “When the tiger isn’t home, the monkey makes itself the king. Shan Ruoshui, if I don’t come back soon, this courtyard probably won’t belong to me anymore!”
 Li Yu smiled helplessly and walked into the room. He could not be bothered to clean up the pink decorations.
 In any case, the room smelled good. The bed was soft and comfortable to lie on.
 After resting in the room for a moment, Li Yu got busy again and began distributing the countless immortal swords he had obtained from the Sword Sect to the disciples.
 After hearing the news, the entire sect was in an uproar.
     

 The disciples thought they had misheard, but when they saw the immortal sword, they were so excited that they were about to cry.
 Most of them had never even touched a spirit sword, let alone an immortal sword.
 It was as if a little boy who had never even touched a girl’s hand had suddenly stuffed a goddess-level stunner into his arms. His excitement was probably enough to make him faint.
 By the time all the immortal swords were distributed, night had already fallen.
 Li Yu called Wu Chang, his father, Tang Chi, Ye Qiu, and Gu Yuqi to the courtyard for a barbecue and a few drinks.
 After everyone left late at night, Li Yu returned to his ‘boudoir’ and fell asleep.
 At night, a few cats slipped into his room and jumped onto his bed, snuggling beside him and snoring lazily.
 Li Yu did not mind. He was used to these cats often coming to sleep on his bed.
 Furthermore, it was comfortable to have these furry little fellows warm his bed.
 Perhaps it was the alcohol or the faint fragrance in the air, or perhaps it was the relaxation after finally returning home, but Li Yu slept soundly.
  The next day, the sun rose. Li Yu turned around slightly.
 This feeling was…
 Li Yu suddenly opened his eyes and sat up. What he saw almost made him vomit three mouthfuls of blood.
 The rather spacious bed was filled with four beautiful women with graceful figures.
 Their skin was smooth and fragile. Their figures were delicate and charming.
 What surprised Li Yu the most was that there were two furry, pointed cat ears on their black, brown, or golden hair.
 “Holy shit, cat girls?”
 …
    
Chapter 220: Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition (1)  “Holy shit, cat girls?”
 When he woke up, he was surrounded by women. Four charming and hot cat girls appeared out of thin air beside him. Li Yu was stunned for a moment, and he even felt that he was dreaming.
 After all, only in his previous life would such rotten scenes appear in his dreams.
 He reached out to touch the curvy body beside him. The touch was realistic.
 Furthermore, her delicate body even flipped over when he touched her.
 It caused a chain reaction. The other three kitten girls either flipped over or stretched their waists.
 One of them even hugged Li Yu’s thigh and curled up, wrapping Li Yu’s leg tightly in her warm embrace.
  Li Yu finally woke up. He knew that he was not dreaming. Be it the visual impact or the tactile impact, these four cat girls were real.
 Furthermore, after some thought, he understood that these four cat girls might be the female cats he had adopted in the past.
 Damn, how could this be happening?!
 These four had really gained human forms. Looking at their seductive figures, not only had they become humans, but they were also adults!
 Li Yu suddenly understood what was going on with his room. It was not done by Shan Ruoshui.
 It was these cat girls.
 While he was away, this house had probably become their boudoir.
 
     

 He was already flustered when he woke up early in the morning. Now, there were four charming, beautiful, and evil beauties lying beside him.
 Li Yu’s essence energy surged, and his Yang energy was too strong. He was about to have a nosebleed.
 “Wake up, wake up. Hey, the four of you, wake up!” Li Yu nudged the four girls to wake them up.
 “What’s wrong?”
 “Hey, I haven’t slept enough!” The four catgirls stretched lazily and yawned.
 Their soft waists, long limbs, and plump bodies swayed in front of Li Yu. They were gorgeous and charming.
 He suddenly felt dazzled.
 People could not help but sigh that it was better to have fun together than alone!
 However, after one of the catgirls stretched and looked at Li Yu in a daze, she turned around and crawled to the end of the bed to continue sleeping.
 “How did the few of you gain human forms?” Li Yu asked. He was baffled by his own words.
 “Ah? Oh, yes!” the brown-haired girl replied. She held her cheek with her hand, and her eyes were not fully open.
 The other two looked at Li Yu in a daze, not knowing what had happened.
  “Can I continue sleeping now?” the black-haired girl asked.
 “Sleep? You guys, you guys can’t sleep in my room anymore!”
 “Why?” The brown-haired cat girl scratched her head and looked at Li Yu in confusion.
 “Don’t you know that men and women shouldn’t touch each other?”
 “Who’s the one touching?”
 “I don’t understand!” The cat girls were puzzled, not knowing what Li Yu was talking about. They had slept with Li Yu like this in the past.
     

 What was wrong with Li Yu today?
 “In short, from now on, without my permission, you are not allowed to enter my room at will, much less get on my bed!”
 “Okay!” The four cat girls replied obediently. Then, they changed their positions and continued to sleep.
 Li Yu looked at their beautiful faces and figures and immediately stood up…
 He grabbed each of them and threw them out of the room.
 …
 Two days later, Li Qingyun officially announced that the Qingyun Sect would be renamed “That’s Quite a Large Sect.” At the same time, he announced that he was about to abdicate.
 The sect master would be Li Yu. At the same time, Ji Qinglan, Ye Qiu, Gu Yuqi, Tang Chi, Wu Chang, and the others would be conferred the title of hall masters of the Law Enforcement Hall, the Pill Hall, and the Refining Hall to assist Li Yu in managing the sect.
 The divine beast Qilin, the purple lightning flood dragon, Long Yue, and Xin Ba would be the guardian divine beasts guarding the mountain. They would guard the north, south, east, and west sides of the sect and be managed by General Guo Qilin.
 Mandarin, Sa Hua, and the other cat girls were handed over to Shan Ruoshui to manage. She was in charge of the spirit herb garden, the spirit spring, and the other spirit beasts in the sect.
 At the same time, they would be in charge of Li Yu’s daily needs.
 “Greetings, Sect Master!” All the disciples and junior brothers bowed in unison.
 Li Yu’s voice shook the nine heavens, and his aura was vast, causing him to be unable to help but feel overwhelmed with emotions. Power and status were forever a man’s desire.
 Li Qingyun officially began his seclusion cultivation, while Elder Nie, who had previously entered seclusion to fuse with his body, officially came out of seclusion.
  Now that he had regained his physical body, it was extraordinary. Although he did not have a soul, his body seemed to be able to cultivate on its own.
 Therefore, after Elder Nie fused with the body, he actually possessed the cultivation of a Perfected Immortal. In his previous life, he was only at the Golden Immortal realm.
 Furthermore, this body was extremely powerful and possessed many powerful innate divine powers. Its potential was not something his previous life could compare to.
 It could be said that if he had such a powerful body in his previous life, not only would he not die, but he would probably have already reached the Sovereign Realm by now.
 “This is great, Elder Nie. You finally have a physical body!” The happiest person to obtain a physical body was naturally Ji Qinglan.
 “Haha, Qinglan, it’s your turn to teach me in the future!” Elder Nie said with a smile.
 Fate was miraculous. Elder Nie did not expect that the Ji Qinglan he taught was also the reincarnation of a sword immortal.
 Furthermore, Li Canglan’s attainments in the Sword Dao in the previous life were far above his.
    
Chapter 221: Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition (2)  “Elder Nie, you must be joking!” Ji Qinglan smiled. “In the future, we can comprehend the Sword Dao together!”
 “Oh yes, it’s time to return the sword to you!” Ji Qinglan smiled as he took out Elder Nie’s immortal sword and returned it to him.
 Although this sword was only an immortal artifact, it was Elder Nie’s intrinsic magic treasure in his previous life. It was also the sword that had accompanied him all the way up.
 “Alright, I’ll take it back then!” Elder Nie did not refuse. He knew that Ji Qinglan did not lack divine weapons.
 “Let’s go pay our respects to the sect master!” Elder Nie added.
 “The sect master has just been invited to the Primordial Dao Holy Land of the Great Zenith Domain to participate in the orthodox sect assembly! I think they’re discussing the handling of the demon attack this time and the future development of the human orthodox sects!” Ji Qinglan said.
 “In that case, I’ll pay him a visit after the sect master returns!” Elder Nie said.
  He was extremely grateful to Li Yu. If not for him, he would not have obtained such an extraordinary body this time.
 The calamity caused by Qing Ye was gradually subsiding. However, the demons who participated in the calamity were not only dealt a destructive blow.
 Now, they had no choice but to face the anger and condemnation of the humans.
 Long Tiancang did not expect that his backyard would already be on fire after he barely escaped from the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm.
 Almost all the combat power of the dragon race had fallen, leaving only the old, weak, and disabled.
     

 What was even more despairing was that they had offended the humans. Faced with the anger of the humans, the Azure Dragon Race could only choose to compromise and take a step back. They took out almost all of the wealth of the Azure Dragon Race and compensated the various Holy Lands and sects of the human race.
 Furthermore, they signed an almost humiliating contract that forbade the Azure Dragon Race from leaving the Thousand Dragon Island forever. Otherwise, they would be killed without exception.
 
 The Nine-Headed Lion Race was forever imprisoned in the Death Eagle Mountain Range of the Grand Desolate Forest.
 These two races were forgiven because Long Yue and Xin Ba were Li Yu’s mounts.
 for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 For example, the Golden Feather Clan, the Demon Fox Clan, the Nine-Headed Snake Clan, the Holy Ape Clan, the Demon Ox Clan, and other clansmen who had entered the Sons of Heaven Rankings. For example, the Demon Fox Clan’s Gu Yue, the Golden Feather Clan’s Qian Yu, the Snake-Legged Bai Su, the Holy Ape Clan’s Benbo’erba, and others were all planted with slave seals and became Li Yu’s slaves.
 The other elites would become slaves of the various Holy Lands, and their clansmen would be exiled to the extreme west as sinners, never to return.
 That was a barren land. Banishing them there was equivalent to leaving them to fend for themselves.
 The fiend sects trembled in their hearts when they saw the demons being dealt with.
 They were not afraid of the various Holy Lands, but they were afraid of Li Yu.
 It could be said that without Li Yu, the various Holy Lands would have suffered heavy losses. It was time for the fiend sects to reap the benefits.
  However, it was different with Li Yu around. He could easily destroy the entire world with his strength.
 Furthermore, he was clearly on the side of the orthodox sects, even though their fiend sects did not participate in this calamity.
 However, it was still a threat from the orthodox sects. Li Yu might directly eliminate them to prevent future trouble.
 Therefore, when the Night God Palace, the Netherworld Cult, the Paradise Cult, and the other fiend sects saw Li Yu visit, they were so frightened that their bodies turned cold.
 Fortunately, he was not here to destroy the sect.
     

 Li Yu knew that this world needed checks and balances. If he killed all the wolves, the sheep would eat all the grass, so he would not eliminate all the fiend sects.
 He only needed to maximize his benefits.
 Therefore, when Li Yu left the fiend sects, he took away many treasures. Although he did not lack them now, no one would complain that their treasures were a hot potato.
 Of course, his main goal was to take back the authority to enter the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm from the fiend sects and the many territories and resources they currently possessed.
 This was also why Li Yu chose to participate in the conference held by the various Holy Lands to discuss the future development of the human orthodox sects.
 This was a reshuffling of the powers in the Immortal Martial World.
 Originally, the various Holy Lands, sects, empires, families, demons, fiend sects, and other factions controlled the distribution of resources in this world.
 For example, the Holy Land. Every Holy Land might control many ancient cities and dynasties. They had to offer various treasures to the Holy Land every year.
 At the same time, they possessed many spirit stone mines, precious jade mines, and various opportunities.
 It was the same for the various demon races and fiend sects. Therefore, after the demons were eliminated, many territories and resource lands under their control would naturally be emptied. This involved the issue of distribution.
 As the absolute hero this time, Li Yu naturally would not contribute selflessly. Their sect still had to develop and dominate this world.
  He naturally had the upper hand in the allocation of resources, not to mention that he had the most say now.
 That was why he came to participate in the convention. Of course, he had obtained everything he wanted.
 Most of the resource lands controlled by the demons belonged to the Qingyun Sect. At the same time, the various Holy Lands had also handed over some of their ancient cities to the Qingyun Sect in exchange for some resource lands belonging to the Grand Desolate Forest and the Endless Sea.
 Now, Li Yu had robbed the fiend sects again.
 The current Qingyun Sect was definitely the strongest and wealthiest faction in the Immortal Martial World.
 Furthermore, at Li Yu’s request, the Lingtian Mystic Realm and the Virtual Sky Mystic Realm would be sealed forever. No one was allowed to enter.
 This was because Li Yu wanted to completely fuse and control the world source of the Lingtian Immortal Realm.
 Once he fully controlled that place, he might be able to turn it into his private world. All the opportunities and wealth hidden there would belong to him alone.
    
Chapter 222: Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition (3)  Of course, Li Yu had his own plans.
 If he could completely eliminate the hidden danger in the Lingtian Immortal Realm, that place might become the new home of everyone in the Immortal Martial World one day.
 As the saying went, when one person attained the Dao, his chickens and dogs would ascend to the heavens. Li Yu felt that one day, he might be able to bring the entire world to become an immortal.
 As the reshuffling of the top factions in the Immortal Martial World ended, the entire world temporarily returned to calm.
 On this day, a rainbow light fell from somewhere and silently sank into the depths of the Endless Sea.
 …
 Days passed, and the Genius Excellence Rankings began announcing the top few.
  Yao Xi, Chu Yunhe, and the other renowned geniuses were also on the rankings, allowing the world to witness their elegant demeanor.
 However, everyone was looking forward to seeing Li Yu the most.
 Most people and living beings in the world had never seen his true appearance.
     

 In the imperial palace of the Heavenly Fate Dynasty, Guo Shengxiu looked at the two cultivators who had just left with a melancholic expression and shook his head helplessly.
 Previously, he had searched for a few days in the Heavenly Fate Dynasty but could not find Lu Li. Helpless, he used his identity as an immortal to subdue the current emperor of the Heavenly Fate Dynasty. He wanted to use the power of the Heavenly Fate Dynasty to help find Lu Li.
 However, a few days had passed, and there was still no news of Lu Li. No one had even seen her.
 “Junior Sister, where are you?” Guo Shengxiu sighed miserably.
 
 Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the hall, and the power of heaven and earth began to fluctuate. Guo Shengxiu was already familiar with this situation over the past few days.
 The Genius Excellence Rankings should be announcing a new person on the rankings. Today was the first announcement of that person’s ascension.
 Guo Shengxiu did not have to think to know that the first place would definitely be Li Yu. This was also publicly acknowledged.
 During this period, Guo Shengxiu had already figured out Li Yu’s true identity. What shocked him was that Li Yu was not what he had guessed.
 He was born and raised in this world.
 However, in Guo Shengxiu’s opinion, even if Li Yu was not from the Immortal Realm, he should be the reincarnation of a mighty figure. In short, he was an extraordinary person that she could not offend.
 In the sky, the first place on the Genius Excellence Rankings was indeed Li Yu.
 As Li Yu entered the rankings, auspicious phenomena appeared in the world again. Auspicious clouds filled the sky, and multicolored lights shone.
     

 No one was surprised by this scene. After all, such an auspicious scene had appeared when Li Yu was on the Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 “I can finally see Li Yu’s true face!”
 “I’m looking forward to his Elegance Exhibition!”
 Countless women who had never seen Li Yu’s true appearance looked at the Genius Excellence Rankings in the sky with anticipation.
 Li Yu’s appearance on the rankings made the Qingyun Sect boil with excitement.
 “Our sect master is finally on the rankings!”
 “Sect Master is indeed extraordinary. Such a phenomenon occurs every time you enter the rankings!”
 “Why haven’t I seen the sect master recently?”
 “I heard from my senior brother that the sect master is in seclusion!”
  “He’s in seclusion. Sect Master is already so strong, yet he’s still working so hard. What right do we have to not work hard?”
 “Yeah, the sect master is indeed our role model. We have to learn from him too!”
 As the disciples discussed, Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition began to appear in the sky.
 The first scene was when Li Yu spoke the mantras of the Great Dao.
 The second scene was of Li Yu destroying the spatial passageway opened by the devil with a single strike in the Immortal Court, killing many devils and saving the Holy Lords.
 The third was Li Yu’s sword sweeping through the gray fog that filled the sky, shattering the world, and reconstructing the void.
 The fourth scene was a confrontation between Li Yu and Qing Ye. The latter agreed to end the spell…
 Everyone in the world fell silent when they saw this shocking scene.
    
Chapter 223: Our Great Hero Is Tired  Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition shocked the entire world again. Although everyone had previously witnessed how powerful Li Yu was through the other people on the rankings.
 However, the impact of these scenes was still huge.
 Especially after Li Yu destroyed the spatial passageway invaded by the devil with a single strike, he even killed the invading devil.
 That strike did not have any gorgeous special effects, not even a sword glow.
 However, it gave everyone a visual impact that struck the soul.
 After that, he swung his sword and instantly wiped out the strange gray fog that seemed to have surged out of the Gate of Hell. It shattered the heavens and the earth, and the sun and moon changed color. The scene was like a miracle, as if Pangu had split the heavens and the earth apart, shocking the soul.
 However, after the shock, everyone sighed in their hearts and could not calm down for a long time.
  “It’s indeed Li Yu who saved us. If he hadn’t rushed back in time, the Immortal Martial World would probably have been destroyed by that person called Qing Ye!”
 “Yeah, just from these few scenes, Li Yu has saved the world more than once!”
 “I’ve imagined Li Yu’s appearance countless times, but no fantasy seems to be as good as his true appearance and bearing. He’s too extraordinary!”
 “I knew it. This first place is well deserved. I’m afraid many people can’t achieve the legends created by these scenes in their entire lives!”
 Countless people discussed excitedly, and countless were grateful. There were also countless women who kept Li Yu in their hearts and became a figure that could never be forgotten.
 “This Li Yu is too freakish!” The corners of Guo Shengxiu’s mouth twitched as she looked at the scene in the sky.
 Previously, he had only seen Li Yu kill Qing Ye. Although it was enough to prove that Li Yu was powerful, it was still understandable.
 
 However, the power of each sword strike just now had already exceeded his understanding.
 Even in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, there were probably not many people with Li Yu’s strength.
 They were the patriarchs and elders of their immortal sects.
 If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would never have thought that such an expert could appear in a lower realm with thin spiritual energy and weak Dao fate.
     

 He had to keep a low profile. The Jingxing Realm was not simple. There were simply crouching tigers and hidden dragons.
 In the Qingyun Sect, the disciples were also excited. Even Ye Qiu and Gu Yuqi could not help but exclaim, “Our sect master is too handsome!”
 “Yeah, we didn’t see these scenes back then. No wonder the various Holy Lords said that they owed their sect master several lives! It seems like it’s true!”
 “Who in the entire Immortal Martial World doesn’t owe our senior brother his life!”
 “Senior Brother probably doesn’t know that he’s on the rankings!”
 “Yeah, he’s in seclusion. Sigh, Senior Brother is so powerful, but he’s still so hardworking. We’re really ashamed of our inferiority!”
 “That’s right. To cultivate an ordinary human body to a physique comparable to a god, Senior Brother must have paid an unimaginable price in private…”
 “Phew… how comfortable!” Li Yu’s ecstatic voice suddenly sounded from the Heavenly Dao Rankings. At the same time, the Elegance Exhibition began its live broadcast.
 On the screen, the half-naked Li Yu was soaking in the hot spring, his face filled with satisfaction and enjoyment.
 This scene instantly drenched countless girls.
 Li Yu could not help but look stunning. His figure was impeccable. The more meat on his body, the better. His body proportions and muscle lines were perfect as if they were carved by nature.
 “Is Eldest Senior Brother in seclusion?” The corners of Ye Qiu’s mouth twitched. Why did he feel that it was different from what he had imagined?
 “Perhaps I was too tired after cultivating just now, so I decided to relax in the hot spring!” Gu Yuqi explained.
 “Master, have some grapes!” With a gentle voice, a graceful figure appeared by the pool beside Li Yu. She held a plate of grapes, took one, and placed it in Li Yu’s mouth.
 “Master, let me massage your shoulders for you!” Another figure appeared behind Li Yu. She had a slim figure and devastatingly beautiful appearance, like a fairy.
 She gently lifted her sleeves, revealing her slender hands and crystalline arms, and was about to massage Li Yu’s shoulders.
 “No need. You guys may leave. Let me be alone for a while!” Li Yu waved his hand.
 “Yes, Master!” The fairies replied in unison and left.
 Li Yu heaved a sigh of relief. “Sigh, it’s finally quiet!”
 Every time he came to the hot spring, these fairies would be especially enthusiastic and solicitous, rubbing his shoulders and feeding him grapes.
 Most importantly, they did not rub their shoulders or backs properly. All of them were dishonest, making it impossible for them to soak in the hot spring properly.
 How annoying!
 Li Yu leaned against the side of the hot spring pool and closed his eyes to rest, enjoying the comfort of the hot spring bath.
     

 Ever since he became the sect master, he was bothered by everything every day. It was difficult for him to slack off for a while.
 Fortunately, most of the matters had been settled recently, and his junior brothers could do their own things. Therefore, he used the excuse of entering seclusion and hiding on the Misty Immortal Island to relax.
 Leaning against the side of the hot spring, Li Yu fell asleep unknowingly.
 However, Li Yu would never have imagined that there were millions of living beings watching him soak in the hot spring until he fell asleep.
 If Li Yu knew that his shower had been broadcasted live by the Heavenly Dao Rankings, he would probably attack with his sword!
 “Go to sleep. You should rest well too!”
 Seeing Li Yu fall asleep in the hot spring, many people were suddenly touched and heartbroken.
 No one thought that he was greedy for pleasure. Instead, they thought that he was too tired from worrying about the commoners.
 Moreover, the current Li Yu seemed to have shed the halo of a god and returned to his true self.
 They suddenly realized that this hero who had saved the world was as powerful as a god.
 Yet, he was not born powerful, like the sun, moon, and stars.
 Instead, he was someone like them who would be tired and needed rest.
 Perhaps they would be afraid, nervous, afraid, and uncertain.
 They thought of how Li Yu had faced the terrifying demonic invasion alone and the gray fog that seemed to come from the netherworld.
 He shouldered the hopes and expectations of everyone, the lives of countless living beings in the world.
 Facing desperate situations alone again and again, he felt immense pressure.
 How much hardship and pain had been hidden behind that seemingly easy strike to hone such an extraordinary strike?
 That body that seemed as powerful as a god had experienced countless hardships. It had only been trained to produce the power to support the entire sky and the commoners of the world.
  And today, their great hero was tired and needed to rest.
 If not for the Heavenly Dao Rankings, they might only see his power but not his pressure. They could only see his extraordinariness but not his exhaustion.
 for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 If not for the Heavenly Dao Rankings, who would know the true appearance of such an expert?
 This reality moved them!
 Just like that, countless people and living beings silently watched the scene of Li Yu soaking in the hot spring in the sky. Their expressions were solemn as they held their breaths and focused.
 Some even had tears in their eyes, while others had sore noses.
 Some cried silently.
 However, no one spoke or made a sound, as if they were afraid that they would disturb Li Yu’s rest.
    
Chapter 224: True Immortal Fart  “So that person is Li Yu!”
 In a certain valley manor, a man with a lazy expression, casual clothes, and loose hair looked at the scene in the sky with a frown.
 If Li Yu was here, he would recognize this person as the person he had seen after encountering the transparent spatial barrier in the Lingtian Mystic Realm that day.
 “I didn’t expect there to be such a terrifying person in the Jingxing Realm. Wu Yong, we have to leave the Jingxing Realm!” A hoarse voice sounded in the man’s ear.
 Wu Yong nodded, his eyes filled with shock.
 When he saw Li Yu shatter the space in front of him that day, he thought it was just a coincidence.
 After all, the space in the Lingtian Mystic Realm that day was extremely strange.
  However, he did not expect Li Yu to really have the ability to shatter space.
 This guy was simply sick.
 “Where are we going?” Wu Yong asked.
 “Let’s go to the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm first! The information about the Flower Realm can help us exchange for something important!” the hoarse voice said.
 “The Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm? I don’t know how to get there!” Wu Yong replied.
 “Don’t worry, I have my ways! Those who have asked you to keep a low profile recently. Don’t cause trouble and don’t attract Li Yu’s attention!” the hoarse voice added.
 Wu Yong nodded. He was also afraid. Fortunately, they kept a low profile at this stage. Otherwise, he would probably have died under Li Yu’s sword.
 
 Li Yu’s Elegance Exhibition lasted twice as long as the others, but Li Yu slept the entire time.
 After the Elegance Exhibition ended, the rankings released the rewards. As expected, Li Yu’s reward was still kept a secret, and he had obtained another additional reward.
 This time, no one was surprised. Li Yu’s extraordinariness was worthy of the additional reward from the Heavenly Dao.
 At that moment, Li Yu suddenly woke up on the Misty Immortal Island.
 “Heavenly Dao reward? Damn, I just got on the Excellence Rankings!”
 Li Yu instantly perked up. Thinking of the live broadcast of the Excellence Rankings, Li Yu felt uneasy.
     

 Wouldn’t the entire process of him soaking in the hot spring be broadcasted to the world by the Heavenly Dao Rankings?
 This ranking was indeed dangerous. Fortunately, he did not indulge himself in lust just now. Otherwise, he would have definitely died of embarrassment.
 However, Li Yu felt that the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings were really fragrant.
 Great Dao auspicious clouds and immortal essence purple clouds.
 This was a treasure similar to the Immortal Spring and the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree. It was a reward that could benefit everyone in the sect and allow the Qingyun Sect to further become an immortal blessed land.
 According to the information sent into his mind by the Heavenly Dao, the Great Dao auspicious cloud was condensed from the power of the Great Dao. The Dao fate it contained was several times stronger than the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree.
 As for the immortal essence purple qi, it was even more powerful. It was the source of immortal energy, the purest and purest immortal energy.
 The immortal energy contained in the top immortal crystals in the world could not compare.
 The lower realm contained spiritual energy, while the Immortal Realm contained immortal energy.
 The reason why people from the Immortal Realm were born with Immortal Spirit Realm cultivation was not only because of the special laws of heaven and earth contained in the Immortal Realm, but also because of the immortal energy.
 Therefore, with the Immortal Essence Purple Qi and the Great Dao Auspicious Cloud, along with the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree and the Immortal Spring, the Qingyun Sect became a true immortal treasure land.
 There were probably not many Holy Lands in the Immortal Realm that could compare to this place.
 “It’s not a dream to become immortals together!” Li Yu said with a smile.
 However, the only flaw in this reward was that… it was sent into his body again.
 Now, immortal energy was churning in his stomach, and auspicious clouds were surging in his respiratory tract. He had to vent it out!
  Li Yu quickly put on his clothes and left the Misty Immortal Island to return to his residence.
 He first looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings. His Elegance Exhibition was over. Then, he checked the house and courtyard.
 After confirming that no one was around, he relaxed slightly. The immortal energy in his stomach surged, and then…
 Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!
 Rich immortal essence purple gas gushed out and instantly spread in all directions.
 Although there was no one around, Li Yu’s series of earth-shattering farts shocked the birds resting on the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree and the colorful butterflies in the courtyard.
 The butterflies and birds, who had already developed intelligence under the nourishment of the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree and the Immortal Spring, immediately sensed how extraordinary Li Yu’s fart was.
 They immediately flew towards Li Yu and danced around him while chattering non-stop.
 Bathed in this pure and rich immortal energy, the birds and butterflies rapidly transformed.
     

 Rich immortal essence purple qi began to spread from Li Yu’s courtyard to the entire sect.
 “This is… purple qi from the east!” Feng Xian was the first to sense the immortal essence purple qi and was immediately shocked.
 Li Yu’s courtyard was located in the southeast corner of the sect. The immortal essence purple qi emitted a faint purple halo that spread from the southeast. It looked like the auspicious scene of the purple qi coming from the east.
 “This immortal energy is so rich and pure!” Sensing the pure immortal energy contained in the purple gas, Feng Xian was even more surprised and could not help but take a deep breath.
 It was truly refreshing. A mouthful of immortal energy allowed his cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds.
 Furthermore, his body was rapidly transforming as he bathed in the immortal energy.
 Perhaps ordinary people did not know how extraordinary this purple gas was, but Feng Xian naturally knew.
 One mouthful of this immortal energy was priceless!
 Suck, suck, suck…
 Perhaps he was afraid that the immortal energy would disappear in a moment, Feng Xian immediately started breathing madly. Furthermore, he only breathed and did not breathe. He looked like he was about to suffocate and die immediately!
 A disciple passing by nearby rushed over in fright. “Hall Master, Hall Master, what’s wrong!”
 Thud!
 Feng Xian kicked the disciple away. He did not have the time to answer the disciple and continued sucking madly.
 At the same time, Elder Nie and Ji Qinglan sensed the dense immortal energy and were pleasantly surprised.
 “Looks like Sect Master has obtained the Heavenly Dao’s reward again!” Ji Qinglan immediately guessed what was going on.
 It was the same when Li Yu obtained the Immortal Spring and the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree.
 It seemed that the reward from the Heavenly Dao was this dense immortal energy.
 “This is incredible. This is simply like sending over an Immortal Crystal Mountain. No, this immortal energy is even purer than immortal crystals! Looks like even if I don’t cultivate in the future, my cultivation will improve rapidly!” Ji Qinglan was extremely excited.
 As someone from the Immortal Realm, he was the same as Feng Xian and naturally knew how extraordinary this immortal energy was.
 “Hmm? Where did this immortal energy come from? It’s so pure!” Lu Li, who was hiding in the corner and eating fruits, widened her sparkling eyes. She took a deep breath and revealed a pleasantly surprised expression.
  Immediately, he stopped eating the fruits and breathed in the rich immortal energy.
 Immortal essence purple qi quickly filled the entire sect. Countless disciples bathed in the immortal qi and sensed the transformation in their bodies. Their cultivation levels soared, and their faces revealed pleasant surprise.
 The Qingyun Sect’s Protective Mountain Array had long been set up by Feng Xian. It could better protect the Immortal Qi and Dao fate inside. At the same time, it could automatically absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and gather it in the array formation.
 Just as countless disciples of the Qingyun Sect were enjoying the extraordinary experience brought by the immortal energy…
 Li Yu’s figure suddenly appeared in the air, and then he looked up and sneezed.
 “Ah… choo!”
 The sneeze shook the nine heavens, spitting out a fog that blotted out the sky.
 Then, under the shocked gazes of Feng Xian, Ji Qinglan, Elder Nie, Lu Li, Gu Yuqi, and all the Qingyun Sect disciples, it transformed into a seven-colored auspicious cloud that hung in the sky.
    
Chapter 225: Upgrading the Heavenly Dao Rankings, Sons of Destiny Appear (1)  The fog produced by Li Yu’s sneeze transformed into auspicious clouds in the sky above the Qingyun Sect.
 Seven-colored light lingered on it, and rich Dao fate energy spread out. If one observed carefully, they could see an extraordinary Dao rune phenomenon in the clouds.
 Furthermore, the scenery that different people saw was different and extremely profound.
 Cough, cough, cough…
 Feng Xian, who had sucked in too much immortal energy, almost died on the spot.
 However, not only did the surrounding immortal energy not disappear, but it even became denser. Feng Xian knew that he did not have to be anxious.
 The immortal energy would probably not disappear.
  When he saw the auspicious clouds that filled the sky from Li Yu’s sneeze, he was shocked.
 “Could this be the legendary Great Dao auspicious cloud!” The knowledgeable Feng Xian had seen descriptions and records of such auspicious clouds before.
 This was a Great Dao auspicious cloud that could only appear in some extraordinary grotto-heavens in the Immortal Realm.
 It was an extraordinary blessing to the people of the Immortal Realm.
 To be able to cultivate under such auspicious clouds, one’s cultivation realm would improve by leaps and bounds.
 In fact, many of the bottlenecks he might encounter on the cultivation path would disappear.
 Furthermore, this auspicious cloud had effects similar to the Dao Comprehension Stone and the Dao Comprehension Tea. One could comprehend the Great Dao by observing the Dao runes inside, and it was helpful in improving one’s Dao techniques.
 
     

 It could be said that the path of cultivation was like groping forward in the endless darkness. This Great Dao auspicious cloud was like a lamp in the night that illuminated the future.
 The Great Dao auspicious cloud combined with the dense immortal essence purple qi was a treasure land that everyone in the Immortal Realm could only dream of.
 Lu Li had the same idea as Feng Xian.
 Her time in the Qingyun Sect had broadened her horizons.
 The sect distributed an immortal sword to every disciple, and they could obtain immortal spring water to drink every day.
 Even some immortal sects in the Immortal Realm could not do this.
 Now, there was also such an extraordinary immortal essence purple qi and the auspicious cloud of the Great Dao.
 Lu Li suddenly felt that the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect was not appealing anymore. Compared to the Qingyun Sect, it was simply a remote village.
 To be precise, most sects in the Immortal Realm might not be able to compare with the Qingyun Sect.
 Cultivating here was much more fragrant than in the Primordial Dao Immortal Sect.
 When Lu Li saw the Great Dao auspicious cloud, memories of this auspicious cloud instantly surfaced in the depths of her mind. They came from her bloodline.
 As these memories surfaced, more memories surfaced. She immediately knew that the dense immortal energy was the top-notch immortal energy—Immortal Essence Violet Qi.
 Not only that, but Lu Li also realized that her bloodline power seemed to have awakened further. Her cultivation was rising rapidly, and a mysterious power surged from the depths of her soul.
 “Heavens, Sect Master is indeed extraordinary. A sneeze can actually produce such a phenomenon!”
 “No wonder that extraordinary purple aura suddenly appeared just now. Looks like it was also caused by the sect master’s sneeze.”
 “He can transform into auspicious clouds and immortal energy with a sneeze. Our sect master is indeed a god!”
 The disciples discussed excitedly, and their admiration for Li Yu was simply like the overflowing Yellow River.
 After releasing the immortal energy and auspicious clouds, Li Yu quickly returned to his courtyard.
     

 However, he was surprised to find a large group of girls in fluttering colorful dresses and some handsome men gathered in the courtyard.
 “This is great! I can finally take human form!”
 “Sister, you look so beautiful in your human form!”
 “Me too. She’s much prettier than me!”
 “We can finally play with Sister Ruoshui and Sister Mandarin!”
 Hearing the excited discussions of the girls, Li Yu immediately understood that the butterflies and birds had become intelligent.
 The immortal essence purple qi and the Great Dao auspicious cloud were indeed extraordinary.
 However, Li Yu knew that this was also thanks to the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree and the Immortal Spring. There were many spirit beasts that had developed intelligence in the Nine-tailed Mountain.
 After some time, there would probably be more demons than disciples.
 Of course, Li Yu did not discriminate against these demons. They could also become immortals.
 “Greetings, Sect Master!” Seeing Li Yu return, the demons bowed in unison.
 “No need for formalities. You guys can report to Shan Ruoshui and Mandarin later!” Li Yu said.
 Currently, all the spirit beasts and demons in the sect were under Shan Rushui’s management, and the orange cat demon, Orange, had already become Shan Ruoshui’s right-hand man.
  Otherwise, Shan Ruoshui would be too busy alone.
 “Yes, Sect Master!” The demons bowed in response, and then they left Li Yu’s courtyard to report to the Spirit Beast Hall.
 Some butterflies and birds that had yet to transform into human forms were still flying beside the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree, while the Chongming Bird was flying around the auspicious cloud.
 At this moment, the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree had grown much taller. Its crown was almost reaching the clouds in the sky, and many strange flowers and herbs that were never there before bloomed in the courtyard.
 Within the range of the Qingyun Sect’s Protective Mountain Array, the mountains, rocks, and plants were undergoing subtle changes.
 In the sky, as the first place on the Genius Excellence Rankings was announced, the names on the rankings disappeared one by one. In the end, the entire Genius Excellence Rankings disappeared.
 After that, the Human Sons of Heaven Rankings, the Demon Sons of Heaven Rankings, the Divine Weapon Rankings, the 3000 Physique Rankings, the Hidden Dragon Rankings, and other rankings disappeared one after another.
 In the end, all the rankings disappeared, and a few words appeared on the golden scroll on the Heavenly Dao Rankings: Myriad Worlds Rankings.
    
Chapter 226: Upgrading the Heavenly Dao Rankings, Sons of Destiny Appear (2)  Countless people were surprised to see the changes in the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 The Myriad Worlds Rankings had clearly been upgraded.
 Those on the rankings in the future were probably not limited to the Immortal Martial World.
 Who knows what ranking is going to be announced next?  Who will be on the rankings?  This made countless people look forward to it.
 They had always lived in the Immortal Martial World. Many had never even left their cities, sects, or countries, much less see the wider world.
  The previous Heavenly Dao Rankings had already broadened their horizons.
 It allowed many to see how extraordinary people and things were in this world.
 This was especially true for the Genius Excellence Rankings.
 They did not expect to witness a wider world and the extraordinary legends of the myriad worlds.
 Just the thought of it excited them.
 It was as if someone who had lived in the mountains for a long time had suddenly come into contact with the Internet.
 A few months passed in the blink of an eye…
 
 Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 The new Phoenix Emperor of the Phoenix Ancient Cave, Huo Wu, had suddenly stepped into the Saint Realm from the late-stage Pseudo-Saint Realm. It instantly shook the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 As for her ranking on the Immortal Realm Sons of Heaven Rankings, it directly surpassed Gongshu Qitian and became number one.
 “This new Phoenix Emperor is indeed not simple. She actually broke through from the late stage of the Pseudo-Saint Realm to the Saint Realm in such a short period of time!”
 “Tsk tsk, with this breakthrough speed, he must have obtained some great fortune!”
 “That’s right. I heard that she went to the Burial Earth World not long ago. She probably obtained some great fortune there!”
 “She went to the Burial Earth World? Tsk tsk, this new emperor is indeed bold. That’s a forbidden area for immortals. Entering it will mean death!”
     

 “Mm, I heard that she’s also preparing for the opening of the Ancient Road to Heaven!”
 “In that case, the Ancient Phoenix Cave should shine this time on the Ancient Road to Heaven!”
 “That’s right. Huo Wu’s strength is not much weaker than Gongshu Qitian to begin with. Now that her cultivation has increased greatly, she might really stand a chance!”
 Phoenix Ancient Cave, Divine Brilliance Palace.
 “Congratulations, Your Majesty!” Countless experts of the ancient cave congratulated the Phoenix Emperor for stepping into the Saint realm.
 After the Phoenix Emperor Huo Wu returned from the Burial Earth World, she went into seclusion. Today, she officially came out of seclusion after successfully breaking through to the Saint realm.
 She also became the youngest saint in the history of the Phoenix Ancient Cave.
 “Huo Wu, you didn’t disappoint me after all. Feng Yi will definitely follow you to the Ancient Road to Heaven!” The previous Phoenix Emperor, Tian Xun, said with extreme relief.
 She was Huo Wu’s mother and the strongest person in the Phoenix Ancient Cave, one of the sixteen Saint Kings of the Immortal Realm.
 The Ancient Phoenix Cave had many Saints and Great Saints.
 However, in the entire Immortal Realm’s younger generation, those who could enter the Saint Realm at such a young age could be counted on one hand.
 Huo Wu’s future limit was not something anyone could compare to.
 In Tian Xun’s opinion, her daughter could even surpass her and touch the Holy Lord and the Sovereign Realm in the future.
 “Thank you, Queen Mother. I will not disappoint you!” Huo Wu was also filled with confidence. She had obtained the bloodline of the Ancestral Magus, Zhurong, in the Burial Earth World and two Paragon Bones.
 The current Huo Wu possessed the Vermilion Bird bloodline, the Zhurong bloodline, the Phoenix Overlord Body, five supreme bones, and the Great Nirvana Divine Fire.
 She was confident that her current strength would absolutely crush all the elites of the Nine Heavens Immortal Realm.
 Suddenly, the power of heaven and earth fluctuated violently. A bell sounded in the sky, accompanied by the slight vibration of space.
 At the same time, a phenomenon appeared. The clouds in the sky changed as thousands of golden clouds surfaced, even covering the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
  There were tens of thousands of multicolored lights in the golden clouds, and various wonders were faintly discernible. It was as if countless gods and saints were stepping on Yin and Yang while plucking the stars.
 Soon, the multicolored light slowly gathered into a giant scroll. Countless obscure and complicated golden characters surfaced. There were a total of 100 characters. In the end, these 100 characters transformed into 100 golden lights that flew in all directions.
 “This is… the appearance of the Sons of Destiny!”
 Countless elders in the Immortal Realm were shocked to see the strange scene in the sky.
 They had either seen such a phenomenon in ancient books or heard of it from their predecessors. It was a phenomenon that had appeared a million years ago.
 Every golden light represented a Great Dao inscription and a Dharma Body Dao Fruit.
 These Great Dao inscriptions would fuse into the body of a certain Son of Heaven, allowing him to directly possess the Dharma Body Dao Fruit and become the embodiment of the Great Dao, becoming the most extraordinary existence in the myriad worlds.
 Therefore, these people were known as the Sons of Destiny.
 It was said that this might be the way the Ancient God Dynasty selected the Divine Lord Holy Sons.
 The chosen person could directly become a Heavenly Destiny Divine Lord in the future and ascend to the Divine Court to control a world with supreme authority.
     

 However, there were also rumors that this was a sign of the impending calamity. Every time the Sons of Destiny appeared, a terrifying calamity would descend. Demons would invade, foreign lands would descend, and natural disasters would occur.
 These hundred Sons of Destiny would bear the heavy responsibility of eliminating demons and uphold justice in the future.
 Others said that the Sons of Destiny were people with limitless merit in his previous life. They had obtained the rewards of the Heavenly Dao and could ascend to the Great Dao in the future, becoming existences above the world.
 Of course, these were all speculations. No one knew why the Sons of Destiny had appeared.
 It was as if no one knew why the Heavenly Dao Rankings appeared.
 However, to many mighty figures, this was an opportunity that descended from the heavens. The so-called Dharma Body Dao Fruit belonged to whoever obtained it.
 “It’s indeed a world of strife!”
 “Looks like the world isn’t peaceful anymore. I wonder how many monstrous experts will rise up. I wonder how many more people will be plunged into misery and suffering!”
 …
 “What kind of phenomenon is this, Queen Mother?” Huo Wu asked curiously.
 “The Sons of Destiny have appeared!” Tian Xun said. “The myriad worlds are bustling again!”
 Huo Wu looked at Tian Xun in surprise. Tian Xun paused and explained to Huo Wu about the Sons of Destiny.
 “Most of these Sons of Destiny will appear in the lower realm. They don’t have young geniuses who have become immortals, but they might become Golden Immortals and Pseudo-Saints in a few short years. Their future will be limitless.”
 “Therefore, the various factions will compete for the Sons of Destiny and take them under their wing. Of course, there must be many people who want to snatch the Great Dao inscriptions from these people or possess their Dao Fruit Dharma Bodies!”
 “Therefore, the various factions and the myriad worlds will definitely start a war around the Sons of Destiny!”
 Hearing her mother’s words, Huo Wu nodded. It seemed that it was going to be an era where experts came in large numbers. There was nothing to be proud of now that she had become a saint.
 However, this was good too. His future path would not be too lonely.
 “Queen Mother, I’ll send someone to the lower realm to search for the chosen ones!” said Huo Wu.
 “Leave this to me. Just focus on preparing for the Ancient Road to Heaven!” Tian Xun said.
 “Alright!” Huo Wu nodded. The urgent matter at hand was naturally the Ancient Road to Heaven. This was the first time their Phoenix Ancient Cave hoped to obtain the inheritance of the Heavenly Imperial Decree.
 In the Qin family, Qin Jingyun looked at the phenomenon in the sky and said, “Wang.”
 “Here!” A figure seemed to appear out of thin air.
 “Immediately send people to the various lower realms to search for any news regarding the Sons of the Destiny!”
  “Yes, my lord!”
 Almost at the same time, the various ancient families, ancient royal families, top factions, and top sects of the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, the Profound Heaven Immortal Realm, and the Luo Heaven Immortal Realm sent a large number of experts to the lower realm to find the Sons of Destiny.
 In the Immortal Martial World, a natural phenomenon also appeared in the sky, shocking the world.
 As the Great Dao inscriptions dissipated, a golden light entered the Qingyun Sect and finally entered Murong Xingqiao’s body.
 In an instant, countless golden words flickered and transformed around Murong Xingqiao. The power of the Great Dao instantly gathered around her. Waves of the Great Dao reverberated in her ears, and the stars moved in front of her eyes. The world changed, everything evolved, and time passed…
 Murong Xingqiao instantly entered a mysterious feeling as if everything around her was gone. She was the heavens, the earth, the endless void…
 At the same time, another golden light fell into the Night God Palace and fused into Night Whisper’s body.
 …
    
Chapter 227: Release the News  for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 Seeing the phenomenon in the sky, Feng Xian and Ji Qinglan recognized that it was a sign of the appearance of the Sons of Destiny.
 In their previous lives, they had also heard about the Sons of Destiny. However, they did not expect to have one by their side in this life.
 They all saw a golden light land in their sect.
 They also sensed the extraordinary fluctuations of the Great Dao. Soon, they learned that the person who obtained the Great Dao inscription was their junior brother, Murong Xingqiao.
 At the moment, Murong Xingqiao was still fusing the Great Dao inscriptions. Some curious disciples gathered outside the house and discussed animatedly.
 Feng Xian and Ji Qinglan immediately dispersed the crowd and instructed them not to tell anyone what they had seen.
 He was well aware that the appearance of the Great Dao inscription was a blessing and a curse. It would definitely attract the covetous eyes of some people.
  They were not afraid. They just did not want to attract unnecessary trouble, nor did they want Murong Xingqiao to be in danger.
 “Senior Brother, go inform the sect master. He should know about this!” Feng Xian said.
 The appearance of the Sons of Destiny was definitely not a small matter. It was enough to shake the worlds and cause many calamities and battles.
 Therefore, he felt the need to inform Li Yu about this.
 “Okay, I’ll go now!” Ji Qinglan nodded. He knew that this was no small matter.
 At the moment, Li Yu was checking the newly upgraded system.
 Not long ago, the system had been upgraded.
 Li Yu checked his personal information in the system first. There was not much change.
 Name: Li Yu (automatically generated)
 Age: 18 (automatically generated)
 Gender: Male (automatically generated)
 Owner’s Sect: That’s Quite A Large Sect (automatically generated)
 Constitution: Human Body (filled in manually)
 Bloodline: Type A (filled in manually)
 Weapon: An ordinary-looking sword (filled in manually)
 Magical Power: Basic Attack Sword Art (filled in manually)
     

 Special Skill: Serious Slash (filled in manually)
 Mount: Guo Qilin (Qilin), Long Yue (Azure Dragon), Xin Ba (Suan Ni), Little Purple (True Dragon) (automatically generated)
 Experience Bar: 0.42% short of becoming invincible…
 However, after leveling up, the method of increasing experience points changed. He could only gain them by completing the system mission.
 Furthermore, ever since the experience bar value fell below one and became a decimal point, the experience points reward of the mission became lesser and lesser.
 It was filled with tricks.
 He had already completed all the sect missions in the previous stage.
 The sect already had more than 1000 Nascent Soul realm disciples, far exceeding the 50 required by the system.
 The number of Soul Formation Stage and Profound Void Martial Stage disciples, as well as the mission of collecting natural oddities, spirit beasts, and divine beasts, were also exceeded.
 Now, the new sect mission had become building an immortal sect.
 There were also many small missions, such as having more than ten thousand disciples.
 The Immortal Spirit Realm required 500 people.
 There were at least ten immortals, five Perfected Immortals, and one Golden Immortal.
 Furthermore, the disciples needed to complete the corresponding contribution missions to reach the required contribution points, such as subduing demons, saving lives, and so on…
 Overall, it was similar to before.
 In fact, even without the system’s request, Li Yu’s disciples had killed plenty of demons and saved lives over the past few months.
 The current Immortal Martial World was much more peaceful and peaceful than before.
 However, there was always white and black in the world. There was good and evil. Ghosts and monsters could never be eliminated.
 Furthermore, as the factions affiliated with their sects controlled more cities and territories, their responsibility increased.
 After all, if they accepted the offerings of the commoners, they would have the responsibility to protect the safety of the commoners.
 Furthermore, the various Holy Lands had suffered heavy losses and would not recover anytime soon. The Qingyun Sect naturally had to shoulder the heavy responsibility.
 ‘Looks like I’ll have to expand the sect further!’ Li Yu thought to himself. Although he had already made major changes to the entire Nine-tailed Mountain Realm, he could not stop thinking about it.
 However, it still seemed unable to satisfy the requirements of the ten thousand disciples.
 Two months ago, after Li Yu completely fused with the world source of the Lingtian Immortal Realm.
 He used the world power of the Lingtian Immortal Realm to remodel the sect’s terrain, making the two peaks of the Qingyun Sect larger, taller, and more majestic.
 It became a true immortal mountain.
 In addition, he had also created many new immortal mountains and precious lands for the expansion of his sect. However, it seemed like he needed to expand further.
     

 However, right at this moment, a new sect mission notification suddenly popped up in the system: Sons of Destiny mission.
 Li Yu took a look. The mission introduced the Sons of Destiny in detail.
 The mission requirement was to “take in 20 Sons of Destiny.”
 “There’s a total of 100, and I’m supposed to take in 20. This mission is a little inhuman. Moreover, the Sons of Destiny are scattered across various worlds. It’ll be difficult for me to find them, let alone absorb them!”
 After reading the system’s mission introduction, Li Yu lost interest.
 Fortunately, there was no punishment for this mission.
 The experience points rewarded were tempting, twice as much as the sect’s director.
 However, Li Yu did not want to make things difficult for himself.
 As soon as he closed the system interface, Feng Xian came to seek an audience and informed Li Yu about the Sons of Destiny and Murong Xingqiao.
 “Murong Xingqiao is one of the chosen ones!” Li Yu was slightly surprised.
 “This matter will definitely alarm the various worlds. I’m afraid the top factions of the various Immortal Realms will begin to search for traces of the Sons of Destiny! Many people from the Immortal Martial World will probably come to visit after some time!” Feng Xian said.
 “Hmm, that’s good news!” A thought-provoking smile surfaced on Li Yu’s lips as he nodded slightly.
 If Ji Qinglan saw it again, he would definitely remember that he had seen this smile when he fought Li Yu.
 Feng Xian looked at Li Yu in surprise, not understanding what he meant, but he did not say anything and only nodded.
 “Alright, you may leave first. Oh yes, release the news of the appearance of the Sons of Destiny in our sect!” Li Yu ordered.
 “Let… let it out? Why?” The surprise on Feng Xian’s face intensified. He could not hide such a thing, so why would he let the news out? Wasn’t this asking for trouble?
 He could not understand Li Yu’s thoughts anymore.
 “Do as I say. I have my own plans. Oh yes, get Murong Xingqiao to see me later! Also, send someone to investigate and see if there are any other clues about the Sons of Destiny in our Immortal Martial World!” Li Yu said.
 “Oh, alright!” Feng Xian’s head was filled with question marks, but he did not say anything else. He bowed and received the order before leaving.
 After walking out of Li Yu’s courtyard, Feng Xian looked back at the courtyard and scratched his head. He still could not understand, but he could only follow the sect master’s orders.
 A day later, Murong Xingqiao completely fused with the Great Dao inscription, and his cultivation directly entered the Immortal Spirit Realm from the Mahayana Realm.
 Previously, Li Yu had given Murong Xingqiao many treasures to help her rapidly improve her cultivation from the Golden Core Realm to the Mahayana Realm.
  “Sect Master, you were looking for me?” Murong Xingqiao arrived at Li Yu’s courtyard and bowed with cupped hands.
 “What happens after you fuse with the Great Dao inscriptions?” Li Yu asked.
 “My cultivation has already entered the late stage of the Immortal Spirit Realm. I should enter the Upper Immortal Realm soon under the effect of the Great Dao inscription!” Murong Xingqiao replied.
 Li Yu smiled and nodded, thinking to himself that opportunities were indeed different. Murong Xingqiao had given him a lot of resources.
 “Come, have a seat!” Li Yu said. Before he finished his sentence, the power of heaven and earth fluctuated again. There was a change in the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 The golden scroll on the rankings flourished with golden light, and two new rankings slowly condensed below the rankings: the Heavenly Physique Rankings and the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings.
 Li Yu and Murong Xingqiao’s eyes flashed when they saw this.
 …
    
Chapter 228: Releasing Heavenly Physique Rankings  “The Heavenly Dao Rankings is announcing a new ranking again. The Heavenly Physique Rankings and the Bloodline Rankings?”
 The appearance of the new rankings immediately attracted the attention of countless people in the Immortal Martial World.
 Many people were no longer unfamiliar with the Physique Rankings, and it was not difficult to understand the Bloodline Rankings.
 However, the Heavenly Physique Rankings and Bloodline Rankings were still something to look forward to.
 After all, they wanted to see what other powerful physiques and bloodlines there were in the myriad worlds.
 At the same time, in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 The Sons of Destiny’s phenomenon had only disappeared for an hour when the rankings suddenly flourished with golden light.
  Immediately, rows of golden words appeared below the 50th Great Expanse Dao Body.
 Physique Rankings # 50: Great Expanse Dao Body
 Owner 1: Kong Jia
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family
 Owner 2: Sun Bingtian
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Sun Family
 Owner 3: Jiang Li
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Grand Unity Immortal Sect
 Owner 4: Wu Wanli
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds, Human Immortal Holy Land
 Owner 5: Su Mu
 
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 “The Physique Rankings are finally releasing!”
 “I didn’t expect this Great Expanse Dao Body to have five owners!”
 “Five isn’t much. Among the countless living beings in the myriad worlds, only five possess such a physique!”
 “There are probably at most one or two in front!”
 “If the first-place human body is really just an ordinary human body, wouldn’t there be countless owners?”
 “Yeah, but I think it’s definitely not an ordinary human body. There must be a secret behind it!”
     

 Seeing that the Heavenly Physique Rankings had begun to be released, countless people from the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings with interest and discussed animatedly.
 Of course, what they looked forward to the most was the owner of the first ‘human body’.
 This was a suspense that had kept them in suspense for a month.
 Now, the truth was finally revealed.
 “Hey, look. The background of the fifth owner of the Great Expanse Dao Body is so strange. What does that mean?”
 “Yeah, if you didn’t mention it, I wouldn’t have noticed. There’s really nothing strange in the world. I’ve heard of Holy Lands, Dao Sects, and Immortal Sects. This is the first time I’ve heard of a ‘Large’!”
 “Hahaha, what kind of sect is this?”
 Countless gazes were successfully attracted by Su Mu’s background, and they were puzzled.
 …
 Immortal Martial World, Qingyun Sect.
 The corners of Li Yu’s mouth twitched when he saw all the information about the owner of the Great Expanse Dao Body that appeared on the Heavenly Physique Rankings.
 F*ck, is there a f*cking limit to the length of the characters on the Heavenly Dao Rankings? It’s actually missing one word. Must it be so f*cked up?  Li Yu regretted asking his father to change the sect’s name back.
 This was an embarrassment.
 That’s Quite a Large Sect had become That’s Quite a Large. The difference was worlds apart.
 However, this was good news. His father had gotten what he wanted. This name had a good concealment effect.
 How could anyone know what ‘That’s Quite a Large’ was?
 Murong Xingqiao was stunned when she saw Su Mu’s background, and then she looked at Li Yu with a strange expression.
 Thinking back to when that sect first appeared on the Hidden Dragon Rankings, many people were puzzled for a while.
 The name of this sect would probably confuse countless living beings in the myriad worlds.
 At this moment, the rankings gave out the rewards for the 50th person.
 With 500 years of cultivation, his comprehension and soul power had doubled.
 As a golden light flew over, Su Mu’s body was bathed in it. Immediately, he sat cross-legged and began to digest the mysterious power contained in the golden light.
 At the same time, the Heavenly Physique Rankings began to announce the owners of the rankings.
 Furthermore, each physique basically had four to five owners, with the highest being seven.
 From the 35th place onwards, each physique only had two to three owners.
 “Senior Brother Ji, your Connate Sword Body should be in the top thirty at least!” Su Mu said with a smile.
 In the Great Xia Dynasty’s 3000 Physique Rankings, Ji Qinglan’s physique was ranked ahead of Su Mu, so Ji Qinglan’s physique could definitely be on the rankings.
     

 He just did not know what his ranking would be.
 “Not necessarily. It’ll probably be my turn soon!” Ji Qinglan said humbly.
 In fact, he did not expect that although he was only one place away from the Great Expanse Dao Body, there was a huge difference in the rankings of the myriad worlds.
 Now that he was almost at 30th place, Ji Qinglan was looking forward to seeing his Connate Sword Body.
 Physique Rankings # 29: Connate Sword Body
 Owner 1: Li Xiaoyao
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Li Family
 Owner 2: Ji Qinglan
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 “Haha, Senior Brother, I guessed right. You’re in the top 30! Congratulations, Senior Brother!” Su Mu said happily.
 Ji Qinglan smiled knowingly. He was also satisfied with this outcome. He did not expect his physique to really enter the top 30.
 “Congratulations, Junior Brother Ji. Your Connate Sword Body is indeed extraordinary to be ranked in the top thirty of the Heavenly Physique Rankings!” Gu Yuqi patted Ji Qinglan’s shoulder and said.
 “You don’t have to make fun of me. Your Ancient God Body is far above my physique. I think your physique might be in the top ten! And Senior Brother Ye’s Firmament Overlord Body must be in the top ten too!” Ji Qinglan said.
 “Hahaha, I hope so!” Ye Qiu said with anticipation. He also wanted to know what rank the Firmament Overlord Body he had obtained was.
 However, he was confident in his physique. It was definitely extraordinary, and he might really have a place in the top ten.
 “I’m looking forward to seeing our Eldest Senior Brother’s physique on the rankings the most!”
 “Eldest Senior Brother’s human body is probably at the top again. Hahaha, this will broaden the horizons of the myriad worlds!” As everyone chatted, the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings fused into Ji Qinglan’s body.
 Ji Qinglan immediately meditated on the spot and began to absorb the mysterious power.
 At the moment, many people in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm noticed Ji Qinglan’s background again.
 “Another person from that sect is on the rankings? I didn’t expect this strange sect to be so extraordinary. There are actually two people on the rankings!”
 “Looks like this sect isn’t simple either!”
 “Yeah, no one from the lower realm has appeared since the 35th place. I didn’t expect another person from the lower realm to appear in the 29th place!”
 “This should be the last person from the lower realm. There probably won’t be anyone from the lower realm before the 30th place!”
 “Hmm, any further ahead is the Saint Body. It’s impossible for such a powerful physique to appear in the mortal world!”
  Indeed, no one from the lower realm came from the 28th to 20th place on the Physique Rankings. Furthermore, there was only one person with each physique.
 Physique Rankings # 20: Fusang Saint Body
 Owner: Heavenly Venerable Caiwei
 Origin: Flower Realm
 Reward: One thousand years of cultivation, four times increase in comprehension and soul power. One Saint King Bone
 “The Flower Realm is still around?”
 “That’s right. I didn’t expect that the Flower Realm Master hadn’t died. Rumor has it that back then, Heavenly Venerable Caiwei was killed by Heavenly Venerable Li Huo and the Dark Prison Demon Lord, and the Flower Realm was destroyed because of that! I didn’t expect that Heavenly Venerable Caiwei wouldn’t die!”
 …
    
Chapter 229: Proud Parasite  The destruction of the Flower Realm back then and its eventual collapse was definitely a major event that shook the heavens. Therefore, many people in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm knew about it.
 As for why the Flower Realm was destroyed, not many people knew.
 However, the struggles between the various worlds in the Nine Heavens were similar to the struggles between the various large sects, families, and factions in the Immortal Realm.
 It would never stop. Even though the Immortal Realm seemed peaceful on the surface, undercurrents were still surging.
 No one knew if any large faction would suddenly be destroyed one day.
 Li Fire Realm, Great Yan Palace.
 A stooped old man with a sinister expression looked at the golden scroll in the sky, killing intent surfacing in his eyes. “She’s still alive!”
  The old man was wearing a Fire Cloud Totem robe. His hair was white, and the ground beneath his feet was charred. The myriad of halls behind him floated above the magma.
 for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 The entire world was filled with flames and destructive auras, as if it was purgatory.
 This old man was Heavenly Venerable Li Huo.
 “Hmph, since you’re not dead, I’ll refine your Fusang Saint Body into a walking stick this time!” A sinister smile appeared on Heavenly Venerable Li Huo’s cold face.
 At this moment, a slender man with flames burning in his hair flew over.
 At first glance, it was as if a torch had flown over and landed in front of Heavenly Venerable Li Huo. He bowed and said, “My lord, someone from the Gongshu family of the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm just arrived. They said that they have news about the Flower Realm!”
 Heavenly Venerable Li Huo looked at the man in front of him as if he was looking at a fool. Then, he looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings and said, “Do I need them to tell me this?”
 “My lord, they say they know where the Flower Realm fell!” The man with the flaming hair added.
 “Oh? Tell him to come and see me!” Heavenly Venerable Li Huo sneered.
 Meanwhile, in the Black Mist Mountain Range, Gu Caiwei looked at the Heavenly Physique Rankings in the sky with a grave expression.
 She did not have to think to know that this ranking could probably be seen in all the worlds. In other words, Heavenly Venerable Li Huo must know that she was not dead yet.
 It was not difficult for him to find Li Yu with his current strength.
 Although she had already seen through life and death, she did not wish to die in the hands of her enemy, nor did she want the last living being of the Flower Realm to die in the hands of that old demon.
 In this way, Qing Ye’s death would be in vain.
 However, she was not even a third of her original strength. She was no longer a match for Li Huo.
 “Qingyun, leave the Flower Realm and return to your world. I can’t implicate you anymore!” Gu Caiwei said earnestly.
     

 Li Qingyun’s expression was calm. He knew what Gu Caiwei was worried about. He smiled and said, “Don’t worry. If Heavenly Venerable Li Huo dares to come, I’ll take revenge for you!”
 “You’re not his match at all. Qingyun, I appreciate your kindness. Although you’ve already stepped into the Perfected Immortal realm, the power of Heavenly Venerable Li Huo is beyond imagination. You still have a long way to go. It’s not worth it for the Flower Realm!” Gu Caiwei added.
 “Haha, I naturally know that I’m not Heavenly Venerable Li Huo’s match, but have you forgotten that I, Li Qingyun, have a good son? Hahaha!” Li Qingyun boasted shamelessly.
 Li Qingyun never got tired of leeching off his son like a parasite.
 Gu Caiwei looked at Li Qingyun and smiled. At this moment, the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings fused into her body.
 Gu Caiwei immediately sat cross-legged and began to absorb the rewards of the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 At the same time, the Heavenly Physique Rankings continued to update.
 Physique Rankings # 19: Earth Saint Body
 Owner: Heavenly Venerable Zhong Yue
 Origin: Heavy Mountain Realm
 Reward: 1000 years of cultivation, four times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Saint King Bone.
 Physique Rankings # 18: Stellar Saint Body
 Owner: Limitless Star Lord
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Limitless Star Palace
 Reward: 1000 years of cultivation, four times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Saint King Bone.
 Physique Rankings # 17: Emperor Flame Holy Body
  Owner: Flame Emperor
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Great Flame Empire
 Reward: 1000 years of cultivation, four times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Saint King Bone.
 …
 “Next is His Majesty’s physique!” An elder stroked his beard in the Dragon King Palace.
 Beside him, Dragon King Ao Ye was thinking about something else. “According to the ancestral records, if one obtains ten Great Dao inscriptions at the same time, he can directly condense a god’s true body and jump out of the Six Paths of Reincarnation to transcend the world and ascend to the legendary God Realm!”
 “Mm, there should be no mistake about what’s recorded in the ancestral records. However, it’s not easy to obtain ten Great Dao inscriptions at the same time! You have to find at least ten Sons of Destiny! And you have to successfully seize the Great Dao inscriptions in their bodies. It’s said that the failure rate is very high!” the elder said in a low voice.
 “It’s worth a try. Our men have already gathered. We’ll head to the 3000 Lower Realms soon!” Ao Ying’s eyes sparkled.
 Transcending reincarnation and standing above the heavens was naturally the dream of many.
 Although they had long lifespans, they could not escape the restraints of heaven and earth and the lightning tribulation that occurred every ten thousand years.
     

 Like a bird in a cage or a prisoner on a stake, life and death were not in their hands.
 Therefore, countless living beings in the world pursued the Great Dao for nothing more than greater power and higher authority. They wanted to escape from this cage and even become gods who controlled the world.
 “Our enemy this time isn’t those Sons of Destiny, but other factions!” the elder added.
 “Yes, in the struggle for the Great Dao, our greatest threat has never been this world, but that group of people like us. Another bloody storm is inevitable in this struggle for the Great Dao’s inscriptions. However, if our Dragon King Hall can’t obtain it, the other factions can forget about obtaining it easily!” Ao Ying’s gaze became increasingly cold.
 As they spoke, the next owner of the physique was announced.
 Physique Rankings # 16: Heavenly Dragon Saint Body
 Owner 1: Ao Ye
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Dragon King Hall
 Owner 2: Ao Li’ao
 Origin: Burial Earth World
 “The eighteenth ancestor is still alive! This is great!”
 “How could it be in the Burial Earth World?”
 Seeing the second owner appear on the rankings, Dragon King Ao Ye and the elder were first shocked before they were overjoyed.
 Ao Li’ao was the eighteenth generation ancestor of their Dragon King Hall, and he was also the person who grasped a lost technique of the Dragon King Hall.
 According to the records, his whereabouts were unknown after entering the Ten Realms Crack in the Chaotic Star Domain.
 They thought that he had already died, but they did not expect him to still be alive.
 If they could find him, they could complete the three important missing chapters of the Primordial Ancestral Dragon Art of their Dragon King Hall.
 “Come, quick, send our eighteen saints to the Burial Earth World to find the eighteen ancestors!” Ao Ye ordered excitedly.
 Physique Rankings # 15: Numinous Treasure Holy Body
 Owner: Gongshu Jin
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family
 Reward: 1500 years of cultivation, five times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Paragon Bone.
  “Congratulations, Father. You’ve just entered the rankings!” Gongshu Qitian walked in from outside the hall and cupped his hands.
 As for Gongshu Jin, who was sitting in the hall, he only nodded slightly and was not too happy.
 After all, it was already known that he was on the rankings.
 Furthermore, he was in a hurry to arrange the search for the Sons of Destiny. This was the top priority, a competition between the various families.
 “Let’s do as I say. Gongshu Dijie, you’ll lead the team to be in charge of the twelve worlds of the Jingxing Realm, the Taihe Realm, and the Ziluo Realm!” Gongshu Jin began to assign people.
 Gongshu Dijie was one of the Gongshu family’s 72 Golden Immortals. He was also the elite among all the Golden Immortal experts of the Gongshu family.
 This time, the Gongshu family sent out all 36 Heavenly Constellation Immortals and 72 Golden Immortals. Each led a team of Perfected Immortals and Exalted Immortals to the lower realm.
 …
    
Chapter 230: This Sect Is Not Simple  As they spoke, the Heavenly Dao Rankings reward fused into Gongshu Jin’s body. He quickly learned the content of the reward.
 He was pleasantly surprised. This reward was not bad, especially the Paragon Bone. It was an extremely precious reward for him.
 “Alright, you can distribute the rest yourselves. I’m going into seclusion to fuse with the Heavenly Dao reward!” Gongshu Jin said.
 Everyone bowed in response and left.
 “Lord Dijie, which world do you plan to go to first?” A man asked.
 “I plan to go to the Jingxing Realm first. My intuition tells me that there must be the Sons of Destiny there! Where is Lord Diyong?” Gongshu Yujie asked with a smile.
 “I haven’t thought about it yet! I’m going back to find Elder Hu Fu for a divination!” Gongshu Diyong said.
  “This time, every family will probably send many immortals to the lower realm. Those mortals will probably be scared silly!”
 “Haha, that’s right. They’ve probably never seen an immortal in their lives. This time, we can enjoy the joy of abusing our power in the lower realm!” Gongshu Dijie said.
 “That’s right! Hahaha…” The group of Golden Immortals laughed as they walked into the distance.
 The appearance of the Sons of Destiny caused undercurrents to surge in the myriad worlds. Even if the rankings were released, it did not stop the various families from moving.
 The various factions sent a large number of people to the lower realm to search for clues regarding the Sons of Destiny.
 As the immortals sent by the various families descended into the lower realm, the Heavenly Physique Rankings were gradually announced to tenth place.
 Physique Rankings # 10: Connate Saint Body
 
 Physique Owner 1: Heavenly Venerable Xuan He
 Origin: Sky Water Realm
 Physique Owner 2: Situ Shuiyue
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Situ Family
 “Heavenly Venerable Xuan He has a Connate Saint Body too!” In the Situ Residence, a woman in a white dress stood on the pavilion and looked at the rankings in the sky.
 She was Situ Shuiyue, Situ Nan’s daughter, ranked fifth on the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm’s Sons of Heaven Rankings.
 At the moment, all the disciples of the Situ family in the 16 cities were slightly restless. This was because Situ Shuiyue was on the rankings, and the Sky Water Realm Master was also on it.
 “I wonder when I can become an expert like Heavenly Venerable Xuan He!” Situ Shuiyue murmured softly. They were both Connate Saint Bodies, and Heavenly Venerable Xuan He was the master of a world. His Heavenly Venerable cultivation was the true peak expert in the myriad worlds.
     

 At the moment, Situ Shuiyue was slightly excited and honored to see that Heavenly Venerable Xuan He possessed the same physique as her.
 She seemed to have found her goal.
 Situ Shuiyue’s gaze moved away from Heavenly Venerable Xuan He’s name, and her limpid eyes stopped at the ‘human body’ at the top of the rankings.
 This was the physique she was most looking forward to and curious about today. There was also the ‘Type A’ bloodline on the Bloodline Rankings.
 She really wanted to know who could possess such a strange physique. Could the owners of these two be the same person or the same group of people?
 During this period of time, there were various different guesses about the human body and Type A bloodline in the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm. There were also explanations from the Deva Sect Master.
 The various explanations added some thought to this physique and bloodline, making Situ Shuiyue curious.
 Of course, there were many others who had the same idea as Situ Shuiyue.
 The various ancient families, the Primordial Royal Family, the eternal factions, and even many Realm Masters and Heavenly Venerables were looking forward to seeing who the first place was.
 Physique Rankings # 9: Void Divine Body
 Physique Owner: Evernight Heavenly Venerable
 Origin: Night God Realm
 At the moment, the Evernight Heavenly Venerable was standing on the Purple Star Platform with his hands behind his back, staring at the various Physique Rankings in the sky.
 As the Realm Master and a supreme Heavenly Venerable, he was not too interested in the rankings.
 He could only stare at the ‘Human Body’ at the top of the Physique Rankings and the ‘Type A’ bloodline on the Bloodline Rankings that aroused his curiosity.
 He could not help but look forward to the announcement of the first place.
 “Congratulations, Master!” A voice sounded from behind him. Immediately, a curvy woman in a black dress walked over.
 Her face was covered by a thin veil, and her almond-shaped eyes were as bright as the stars. Her beautiful hair was decorated with masters emitting silver halos. From afar, her hair was like the night sky, filled with stars.
 “Tian Shu, you’ve come at the right time. Master has a magic treasure for you!” With a wave of Evernight Heavenly Venerable’s hand, three black pearls appeared in front of him, emitting an extraordinary aura.
 The woman called Tian Shu’s eyes brightened as she stared at the three pearls in surprise.
 “This is a true natural divine artifact and my master’s strongest magic treasure, the Night God Pearl. This Night God Pearl is a strange object that coexists with heaven and earth.”
 There were a total of five pearls: First Night, Late Night, Remnant Night, Dark Night, and Eternal Night.
 Each contained a law of the night with boundless power.
 Her master had only achieved what he had today because of the Eternal Night God Pearl. Later on, he was fortunate enough to obtain the two pearls, Late Night and Remnant Night.
 They were still short of First Night and Dark Night.
 “Since you’re going to the Ancient Road to Heaven this time, I’ll give you this Late Night God Pearl. It should be able to help you pass through the Ancient Road to Heaven!”
 “Thank you, Master!” Tian Shu received the Night God Pearl from the Heavenly Venerable and was extremely excited.
     

 This was a divine artifact, the strongest treasure in the world.
 “Master, have you never found the other two divine pearls?” Tian Shu asked.
 “Hmm, perhaps it’s in a certain chaotic void!” said the Evernight Heavenly Venerable. He also wanted to find the other two pearls. Perhaps he could solve the mystery of heaven and earth and truly reach the realm of a god.
 As they spoke, a white-robed man embroidered with a black star totem walked in. He bowed and cupped his hands. “Realm Master, I just received news from the Night God Palace in the lower realm. A Sons of Destiny has appeared in the Night God Palace in the Jingxing Realm!”
 Hearing this, a trace of joy appeared in the eyes of the Evernight Heavenly Venerable. “Very good. Immediately send someone to bring them into the Night God Realm!”
 “Yes, my lord!”
 …
 In the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, after the owner of the Void Divine Body was announced, everyone’s gazes gathered on the eighth-ranked Firmament Overlord Body, their eyes filled with anticipation.
 This was a famous and powerful physique, and what made it famous was its exclusive owner, the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor.
 Previously, when everyone saw this physique on the rankings, they guessed that Ancient Emperor Qing Cang might not have died.
 And the answer was about to be announced today…
 In the Immortal Martial World, Qingyun Sect.
 Su Mu, Tang Chi, Gu Yuqi, Ji Qinglan, Ye Qiu, and the others looked at the rankings eagerly.
 “Junior Brother, you guys are awesome. Your Firmament Overlord Body and Ancient God Body are already in the top ten!” Tang Chi hugged Ye Qiu and Gu Yuqi’s shoulders and smiled.
 On the other hand, Gu Yuqi and Ye Qiu were a little nervous, but they were looking forward to it more. They also wanted to know what their physiques could rank in.
 Furthermore, when they thought of the countless powerful immortals and living beings in the various worlds paying attention to this ranking, their blood inexplicably boiled.
 Finally…
 Physique Rankings # 8: Firmament Tyrant Body
 Owner: Ye Qiu
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 “Beautiful, hahaha, Junior Brother Ye, you’re too awesome. You’re in eighth place!” Tang Chi hugged Ye Qiu and shook him. He was so excited that it was as if he was the one on the rankings.
 “Congratulations, Senior Brother!” Everyone congratulated him.
  Ye Qiu was also overjoyed. He was proud of himself. When he thought of the expressions of the big shots of the heavens when they saw that the eighth place was from the lower realm, they must be thrilled.
 As Ye Qiu had expected, countless people in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, Luo Heaven Immortal Realm, the Mixed Heaven Immortal Realm, and other immortal realms were also shocked when they saw Ye Qiu’s background.
 When they saw that the owner of the Firmament Overlord Body was not the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor, they were already shocked.
 However, after seeing Ye Qiu’s name, they thought that he was from the Ancient Family of the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, the Ye family, and that he might be lucky enough to obtain the inheritance of the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor.
 In the end, when they saw Ye Qiu’s background, their jaws dropped.
 What was even more shocking was that this person’s background was actually the same as the owner of the Connate Sword Body. He was also from that strange sect.
 for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔 “It’s this sect again!”
 “This That’s Quite a Large isn’t simple!”
    
Chapter 231: How Should We Interpret This?  “Is Ye Qiu a member of the Ye family who wandered into the lower realm?”
 “That’s possible. Otherwise, how could such a powerful physique appear in the lower realm!”
 Countless people in the Immortal Realm tried to comfort themselves.
 Otherwise, they really could not understand what they had seen.
 From the 28th place on the rankings, no one from the lower realm could be seen.
 They never imagined that someone from the lower realm would suddenly appear in eighth place.
 8th!
  How many mighty figures and top experts had been suppressed by this ranking?
 In front of him was the Patriarch of the Ancient Family, the top prodigy of the Ancient Family, and the high and mighty Realm Master Heavenly Venerable.
 In the end, a person from the lower realm suddenly appeared here.
 This made the immortals lose face, so they were absolutely unwilling to believe that Ye Qiu was a mortal from the lower realm.
 However, the people from the Ye Family in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm were also in an uproar. Many people guessed that Ye Qiu might be a member of their Ye Family.
 Even the Ye family’s master, Ye Tianxing, felt that Ye Qiu was definitely a member of their Ye family who had wandered into the lower realm. He even immediately sent people to investigate all the branches of the family to confirm if any Ye family disciples had really wandered into the lower realm.
 “Ye Qiu!” Ye Cheng looked at the name on the rankings and frowned slightly.
 
 For some reason, he was slightly jealous of Ye Qiu. The difference of one word was like heaven and earth.
 ‘If I can possess the Firmament Overlord Body, I’ll definitely have the qualifications to compete with Gongshu Qitian, Qin Feng, and the others.’ Ye Cheng pondered.
 Now that the various ancient families of the Grand Desolate Immortal Realm had produced geniuses, the Qin family and the Gongshu family had produced unprecedented geniuses.
 Even Situ Shuiyue from the Situ family did not lose to them by much.
 As a Divine Son, he seemed useless compared to them.
 They were both from ancient families and were all divine children.
 They would inevitably be compared and commented on. Although Ye Cheng did not say it, he was filled with jealousy and unwillingness.
 He, who had always been careful and proud, naturally could not stand the difference now and was unwilling to look up to it.
 “That’s Quite a Large? Which world is it in?” Ye Cheng narrowed his eyes slightly.
     

 …
 Qin Family’s Heavenly Star Palace, Star Seizer Tower.
 Qin Jingyun, Qin Jingtao, and the others from the Qin family drank tea while admiring the Heavenly Physique Rankings outside.
 Although they admired him, they were actually quite nervous.
 It had already announced the eighth place, but Qin Feng was not on the rankings yet. Clearly, his physique was at the top.
 However, what kind of physique was it? This was a question that they had been curious about for many years. It was finally about to be revealed today.
 The Desolate Saint Body, the Eternal Divine Body, the Primordial Divine Body, and the Grand Ancestral Divine Body seemed possible. It was even possible for that mysterious “human body”.
 “I didn’t expect a physique like the Firmament Overlord Body to appear in the lower realm!”
 “He’s probably the successor of the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor. I can only say that this person is very lucky to obtain the inheritance of the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor!”
 “This time, the Ye family will probably publicize that this is someone from their family who fell into the lower realm!”
 “Hmm, the Ye family will probably look for this child everywhere and bring him back to the Ye family to announce that he’s a member of their family!”
 “How could the Ye family do such a thing?” Qin Jingyun and the others laughed.
 “Hmph, that Ye Cheng probably wishes he could become Ye Qiu!” Qin Feng sneered.
 “The next is the Desolate Saint Body. I wonder if it’s Feng’er’s physique!” Qin Jingyun seemed calm, but he was actually looking at the Heavenly Dao Rankings nervously.
 Physique Rankings # 7: Desolate Saint Body
 Owner: Jun Wuhui
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Jun Family
  “So he’s from the Jun family of the Luo Heaven Immortal Realm!” Qin Jingyun heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that his son had at least a divine body that was more powerful than a sacred body.
 This made him feel more at ease. Although the first place human body sounded awful, it would be good if he could become the top and suppress the Chaos Divine Body.
 “This person seems to be the current son of the Jun Family!” Qin Jingtao remarked.
 “That’s right. This Jun Family’s divine son is extremely famous in the entire Luo Heaven Immortal Realm. It’s said that he possesses invincible talent and the strength to sweep through the current era!” Another Qin Family member said.
 “Hmph, that’s because the elites of the Luo Heaven Immortal Realm are too weak. Come to our Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm and you’ll probably know who’s invincible in this era!”
 “It’s also said that his appearance and aura are stunning and extraordinary!”
 “Hehe, there are a lot of rumors about this Divine Son. I wonder if they’re true!” Everyone laughed.
 “They’re here. The sixth place is about to be announced!” Everyone’s attention was focused on the rankings again.
 Qin Feng stared at the golden light on the rankings and slowly gathered a name.
 Physique Rankings # 6: Eternal Divine Body
 Owner: Qin Feng
     

 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Qin Family
 “Eternal Divine Body! Mine is the Eternal Divine Body?” Qin Feng had mixed feelings. He seemed happy, but for some reason, he felt disappointed.
 Perhaps it was because he had higher expectations in the past.
 However, after knowing his physique, Qin Feng finally felt relieved.
 No matter what, his physique was already extraordinary.
 “So Feng’er has the Eternal Divine Body! Haha, not bad, not bad!” Qin Jingyun laughed heartily, even though he felt the same disappointment as Qin Feng.
 However, there was also the same joy.
 The Qin family was also overjoyed. The question that had puzzled them for many years was finally answered.
 At the moment, many people in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm were also discussing the extraordinary son of the Qin family. Everyone in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm knew about the various extraordinary events when Qin Feng was born.
 Of course, Qin Feng was really strong. He, who could be compared to Gongshu Qitian, did not disappoint them.
 Although the Eternal Divine Body was ranked sixth, no one dared to underestimate it.
 The difference in physique and strength between the top few was probably not too great. If not for the Heavenly Dao ranking, it was still unknown who would be stronger in a competition.
 “Next is the Primordial Divine Body. I wonder who has the physique?” Countless people from the Immortal Realm looked at the rankings with anticipation.
 After all, they were already in the top five. Those who could be on the rankings were definitely extraordinary.
 Physique Rankings # 5: Primordial Divine Body
 Owner: Gu Yuqi
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Silence rang out.
 The entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm seemed to fall silent for a moment as everyone looked at the person on the rankings in surprise.
 It was this strange sect from the lower realm again!
 If they had seen Ye Qiu appear on the rankings previously, they could still link it to the members of the Ye family of the Primordial Era to explain everything and seek balance in their hearts.
 In that case, the Gu Yuqi in front of them had completely shattered their understanding.
 How should he interpret this?
  Another immortal from the lower realm?
 Was that the Immortal Realm’s homeless shelter?
 Furthermore, they were all stunning big shots!
 This clearly didn’t make sense!
 The Great Expanse Dao Body, the Connate Sword Body, the Firmament Overlord Body, and the Primordial Divine Body. How could a mere faction from the lower realm possess four people with special physiques on the rankings at the same time?
 Looking at the rankings, it was almost comparable to the number of people on their Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm’s top factions.
 What was more terrifying was that there were two physiques in the top ten.
 …
    
Chapter 232: The Gods’ Shelter  “Haha, Junior Brother Gu is on the rankings! Fifth place. Impressive. Eh, Primordial Divine Body? How did you become a Primordial Divine Body!” Tang Chi hugged Gu Yuqi excitedly and shook him.
 “Yeah, Junior Brother Gu, don’t you have an Ancient God Body?” Ji Qinglan and the others were also a little surprised.
 “I’m not sure either. Maybe my Ancient God Body awakened further and became the Primordial Divine Body. Or maybe it’s the same physique as the Primordial Divine Body!” Gu Yuqi scratched his head.
 “Haha, that’s not important. Who cares what physique he has? We’ve also occupied three of the top ten spots on the Heavenly Physique Rankings. Those mighty figures in the various worlds will probably be shocked to the point their jaws drop!” Tang Chi said excitedly.
 The corners of everyone’s mouths curled up as they nodded slightly, especially Ji Qinglan and Feng Xian. As people from the Immortal Realm, they could understand the feelings of those from the various Immortal Realms.
 This was because they were also shocked by their own sects time and time again. Furthermore, this was only the beginning. The subsequent rankings would probably make the various large factions of the Nine Heavens Immortal Realm explode in anger.
 Countless members of the Gongshu family discussed as they looked at the rankings in the sky. The elders were also shocked.
  “This strange faction isn’t simple!”
 “Looks like I have to investigate this faction properly!”
 At this moment, it was not only the Gongshu family. The Qin family, the Ye family, the Mo family, the Situ family, the Dragon King Hall, the Phoenix Ancient Cave, and the other members of the Primordial Imperial Family were also incomparably shocked.
 The top ten of the rankings were actually occupied by two spots by a strange faction from the lower realm. They could not help but find it unbelievable.
 It also piqued their interest in this strange faction.
 However, just as they thought that it was already shocking enough for this strange faction to occupy the top ten or two spots…
 Physique Rankings # 4: Phoenix Overlord Body
 
 Owner: Huo Wu
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Phoenix Ancient Cave
 Reward: 2000 years of cultivation, seven times increase in comprehension and soul power, one Paragon Bone
 Physique Rankings # 3: Grand Ancestral Divine Body
 Owner: Nie Yongan
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 “Heavens, it’s that lower realm faction again!”
 “This is unbelievable. The third place is actually that lower realm faction!”
 “Are you sure this is the same faction and not the same type of faction?”
 “That’s a little scary, right? How can there be so many powerful physiques in the lower realm? The third place’s Grand Ancestral Divine Body is also from the lower realm!”
 “Looks like the appearance of the Sons of Destiny is not a coincidence. It’s indeed a world of strife. I’m afraid a heaven-defying child is about to appear in the lower realm!”
 “This doesn’t seem to be good news for us!”
 “Why do I have a feeling that the first place might be from this lower realm faction!”
     

 “It can’t be. If the first place is too, that would be too scary!”
 “But judging from the strange name, it’s really possible!”
 At this moment, countless people in the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm could not calm down. They felt that their understanding had collapsed.
 The high and mighty Immortal Realm factions could not even compare to a faction from the lower realm.
 It was like a group of self-righteous developed countries suddenly seeing a primitive African tribe with nuclear weapons.
 Furthermore, they not only possessed nuclear weapons, but they also possessed a cosmic battleship that even they did not have.
 Not to mention having a mental breakdown, even his understanding was about to collapse.
 At this moment, the Heavenly Physique Rankings had clearly changed. Some arrogant immortals felt a sense of defeat.
 Furthermore, they were worried about the first place.
 A smile surfaced on the corners of the Deva Sect Master’s mouth. He should be the person in the Immortal Realm who looked forward to the first place being a mortal from the lower realm the most.
 This way, his previous speculations would be verified, and his ideals could be convinced.
 Otherwise, the Grandmaster of Heaven would definitely try to overturn his opinion from that day.
 “Is the first place really a mortal?” The Grandmaster of Heaven of the Heaven and Earth Sect had an ominous feeling.
 “That old fellow, Deva, has really gotten it right!” The Grandmaster of Heaven said indignantly.
 “This ranking is getting more and more interesting!” A smile surfaced on the corners of the Evernight Heavenly Venerable’s mouth.
 “Not bad, another target to possess!” An old man in the Fallen God Palace of the Netherworld Heaven Immortal Realm looked at the rankings greedily.
 At this moment, the anticipation of countless people and living beings for the first place had already surpassed the expectations of the second place.
 Almost everyone’s attention was on the first place.
  It made the Chaos Divine Body in second place become a punctuation-like existence.
 It did not affect anyone’s emotions at all.
 Physique Rankings # 2: Chaos Divine Body
 Owner: Gongshu Qitian
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family
 Reward: 2000 years of cultivation, eight times increase in comprehension and soul power, two Paragon Bones
 Physique Rankings # 1: Human Body
 Owner of Physique: Li Yu
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Reward: Secret
 Additional Reward: Secret
 “It’s really this lower realm faction!”
 “This is unbelievable!”
     

 “Li Yu!”
 “Could this human body really be the most ordinary mortal body? How is that possible!”
 “What kind of existence is that door?!”
 “The reward for first place is actually kept a secret!”
 “Why is there an additional reward?”
 After seeing that the first place was really from the lower realm, countless people from the Immortal Realm had mixed feelings and were shocked.
 However, they were even more confused about the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 How could a mere mortal’s body be ranked ahead of so many divine bodies?
 Furthermore, why was he the only one on the rankings? What was the difference between his human body and others?
 They needed an explanation from the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 At this moment, a row of golden annotated words appeared below the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 Physique Interpretation: Mastering extraordinary power with an ordinary physique, matching the gods of the heavens with a mortal body.
 Upon seeing this annotation and this row of words, everyone in the Immortal Realm could not calm down.
 It was really just a mortal body, the most ordinary human body.
 This was simply a slap in the face. Not only was the rankings slaughtered by this lower realm faction, but the first place was also a mortal.
 How could these high and mighty immortals endure this?
 According to the Heavenly Dao, if Li Yu cultivated his mortal body to an extremely powerful physique, he would ultimately only have a mortal body.
 Furthermore, they had never heard of anyone cultivating a mortal body into a powerful physique comparable to a god.
 This was simply shocking and unbelievable.
 “Hahaha, you didn’t disappoint me after all!” The Deva Sect Master was in a good mood.
 The interpretation given by the Heavenly Dao was somewhat different from his previous interpretation.
 However, there was not much difference. This meant that the theory he advocated was right.
 The human body was the physique with the greatest potential in the world, and humans were also the most powerful creatures in the world.
 “It’s only a mortal body? Isn’t the Heavenly Dao Rankings exaggerating a little? I don’t believe that a mortal body can really surpass my Chaos Divine Body no matter how much he cultivates!” Gongshu Qitian was unconvinced.
 If that human body did not mean what it sounded like and was an unknown powerful physique with this name, he would not be affected.
 However, now that the Heavenly Dao Rankings had clearly told him that he had lost to a mortal, he could no longer remain calm.
  Furthermore, he could not understand or believe that a mortal body could really compare to a god.
 “Li Yu!” Situ Shuiyue looked at Li Yu’s name, and her eyes were filled with surprise.
 She had a feeling that this must be a person and a sect with a story.
 If she had the chance, she wanted to go to the lower realm to see what kind of people they were.
 “A mortal body?” Huo Wu’s eyes flickered as her gaze finally stopped at the first place on the Bloodline Rankings.
 “Looks like the first place might be him too. Does that represent the mortal bloodline?”
 “How boring!” Qin Feng shook his head in disappointment. He thought that this human body was an unbelievable physique, but it was just a mortal body.
 “This lower realm faction is indeed interesting. There are indeed crouching tigers and hidden dragons. I’m getting curious!” The Evernight Heavenly Venerable looked at Li Yu’s name with interest.
    
Chapter 233: Invincible Heavenly Dao Reward  “I didn’t expect Elder Nie’s body to be the Grand Ancestral Divine Body!”
 “Wow, Elder Nie is in third place!” Tang Chi, Ji Qinglan, Su Mu, and the others were also pleasantly surprised.
 They did not expect Elder Nie’s body to have such a powerful physique.
 “Hahaha, this is too awesome. Our sect has actually dominated the rankings too!”
 Everyone was overjoyed. Not only did they dominate the Immortal Martial World’s rankings, but they also occupied many key positions on the Myriad Worlds Rankings, especially the top few.
 It was as if a person thought he was the richest man in the village, only to discover that he was also the richest man in the world.
 Although the Heavenly Physique Rankings had already ended, many people in the Immortal Realm could not calm down for a long time.
  Initially, there would not be any intense emotional fluctuations when they looked at the rankings. However, they did not expect the effect of the rankings to be so good.
 Not to mention that the rankings were slaughtered by an unknown faction in the lower realm.
 The first place’s human body was also a shocker.
 It made them feel restless.
 Moreover, judging from the current situation, the owner of the strange number one bloodline on the Bloodline Rankings was likely Li Yu. After all, their styles were uniform.
 It might even be an ordinary mortal bloodline.
 However, they could not understand how the most ordinary human body and bloodline could be ranked first by the Heavenly Dao.
 
 Even if he really cultivated his physical body to a high level through a certain cultivation method, how strong could a mere mortal body be?
 It was like an ant versus a divine dragon. If an ant’s body was cultivated to the extreme, could it suppress a divine dragon’s body?
 They could not understand.
 Of course, most people were only watching the show.
 In any case, it did not matter to them who got on the rankings. They could just laugh it off.
 What’s the point of thinking so much? They were not doing scientific research or writing a thesis here!
 Furthermore, there were all kinds of strange things in the world that did not follow logic.
 If he had to take it seriously, he would probably have to ask the heavens why they made themselves look so mediocre.
     

 After the Heavenly Physique Rankings were announced, the Bloodline Rankings were not announced immediately. Everything seemed to have settled temporarily.
 Immortal Martial World, Qingyun Sect.
 Li Yu felt comfortable bathing in the golden light of the Heavenly Dao. The reward from the Heavenly Dao Rankings was the Great Dao Golden Body.
 This golden body could absorb the power of all Great Dao and ignore all Dao technique attacks.
 At the same time, his body was the Great Dao that contained the true meaning of the three thousand Great Dao.
 It could be said that his body possessed the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree, the Dao Comprehension Stone, the Dao Comprehension Tea, the Great Dao auspicious cloud, and other functions. It was even superior to them.
 His body naturally emitted the power of the Great Dao, and rich Dao runes lingered around him.
 Any sound he made contained the true meaning of the Great Dao. Even his breath was the purest immortal energy in the world.
 If one came into close contact with it, the more one could comprehend the true meaning and mysteries of the Great Dao.
 ‘I keep feeling that I’ll be the center of attention in the future!’
 Countless people wanted to hug him to comprehend the Great Dao and imagine the scene…
 He could not help but sweat profusely.
 However, it had to be said that the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings were getting more and more explosive.
 The additional reward this time was also fragrant. It happened to form a perfect set meal with the Great Dao Golden Body.
 The additional reward was the Heart of Heaven and Earth.
  He could sense all the power in the world and control it. Coupled with the Great Dao Golden Body, he possessed the powerful ability to command the law.
 In the future, whoever Li Yu told to scram would never get lost.
 The Heavenly Physique Rankings were announced in less than two hours in the Immortal Realm.
 Meanwhile, two days had passed in the Immortal Martial World.
 With the generous rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings, Su Mu’s cultivation directly stepped into the peak of the Immortal Spirit Realm. He was already half a step into the Immortal Rankings.
 As for Ji Qinglan, he had also stepped into the Perfected Immortal realm. As for Gu Yuqi and Ye Qiu, they relied on the rewards from the Heavenly Dao Rankings to ride the wind and directly broke through two major realms to enter the Golden Immortal realm.
 Elder Nie had also successfully stepped into the Heaven Immortal realm from the Perfected Immortal realm.
 …
 On this day, in the imperial palace of the Xi Liang Dynasty, drums, music, and flutes reverberated through the palace. Imperial maids with graceful figures fluttered and swayed.
 A man with sharp brows and starry eyes sat on the dragon couch with an extraordinary aura. As for the Xi Liang Dynasty’s Emperor, Ji Tianchang, and the ministers and the Ji family’s cultivators, they were kneeling at the side.
 This man was none other than one of the Golden Immortals sent by the Gongshu family to the Mystic Realm, Gongshu Dijie. Standing behind him were the few immortals who had followed him here.
     

 Gongshu Dijie reached out and picked up a spirit fruit from the fruit platter served by the palace maid. He took a bite and immediately spat it out.
 Then, he threw the fruit back into the fruit bowl.
 He glanced at the swaying palace maids below with a bored expression.
 “Alright, send these ordinary women down! There are no surprises in the lower realm!”
 After Gongshu Dijie arrived in the Jingxing Realm, he happened to appear in the Xi Liang Dynasty.
 Therefore, he went straight to the Xi Liang Imperial Palace and prepared to let these native mortals run errands for him to find clues about the Sons of Destiny.
 At the same time, he could enjoy the joy of being a tyrant. However, he did not expect that the lower realm was the lower realm. The food was not delicious, the wine was not delicious, and the women were all ordinary.
 He was really not interested, and the people who displeased him the most were the mortals in front of him.
 For some reason, he felt that the reactions and expressions of these mortals when they saw him were completely different from what he had imagined.
 It was as if something was missing in their eyes.
 Although they were all kneeling respectfully in front of him, there was no fear or shock in their eyes. They were even calm.
 It was like the difference in the way a young girl looked at a man.
 Did they get so scared that they forgot about their fear??Gongshu Dijie thought to himself.
 Regardless, he still felt a little unhappy.
 If he did not need these native mortals to help him obtain information, he would really like to let them experience how terrifying the power of a Golden Immortal was.
 It made them tremble in front of him.
 “Mortal Emperor, let me ask you something!”
 Gongshu Dijie looked at Ji Tianchang angrily.
 “Did you see the natural phenomenon not long ago? Thousands of golden clouds surfaced, and various wonders were faintly discernible. In the end, the multicolored light slowly gathered into a giant scroll, and countless obscure and complicated golden characters transformed into flowing lights that filled the sky and flew away!”
 “I see it. You’re talking about the Sons of Destiny, right?” Ji Tianchang asked.
  Upon hearing Ji Tianchang’s words, Gongshu Yujie felt uneasy again.
 He gave a long explanation, afraid that these mortals would not understand if he used professional terms.
 In the end, he knew about the Sons of Destiny.
 This made him seem a little foolish!
 “You know about the Sons of Destiny?” Gongshu Yujie was a little surprised, but it was a good thing. It seemed that this mortal emperor knew something.
 “Yes, but I also heard that the Great Xia Dynasty’s Qingyun Sect produced a Son of Destiny. I only found out about the Sons of Destiny after hearing this rumor!” Ji Tianchang said.
 This news was not a secret to begin with, and many surrounding countries knew about it.
 Furthermore, Ji Tianchang believed that these guests from the Immortal Realm had ill intentions. He could not deal with them anymore, so he could only send them into the tiger’s den.
    
Chapter 234: Kneel  “Really?” Gongshu Yujie was pleasantly surprised.
 He did not expect himself to be so lucky to find out about the Sons of Destiny is soon as he arrived in the lower realm.
 This was an auspicious sign, indicating that his trip to the lower realm would be smooth sailing.
 If he could keep going smoothly, he might find the most Sons of Destiny. Then, he would definitely be rewarded when he returned, and his status in the Gongshu family would surely improve in the future.
 This happiness came too suddenly, and he almost got carried away.
 “Mm, I shouldn’t be wrong!” Ji Tianchang confirmed.
 His two sons were in the Qingyun Sect. How could he not know about this?
  “Very good. Quickly send someone to inform the Qingyun Sect to bring that Son of Destiny over to see me!” Gongshu Yujie ordered.
 “This…” Ji Tianchang hesitated.
 He thought that they would head to the Qingyun Sect after he told them the news so that he could send these arrogant fellows away.
 He did not expect these guys to stay here and not leave.
 “What? You can’t even do such a small thing?” Gongshu Yujie’s expression turned cold.
 He was a Golden Immortal from the Immortal Realm. Wouldn’t it be too embarrassing for him to personally visit?
 Furthermore, in his opinion, even if that person was the chosen one, he was only a mortal from the lower realm.
 If this Golden Immortal wanted to see him, he would definitely come over excitedly.
 “Alright, I’ll send someone to send the news now!” Ji Tianchang was helpless.
 He could only pray that the two sides did not fight. His palace had only been repaired for less than a year.
 Furthermore, the ones who came this time were from the Immortal Realm. If Li Yu really attacked, not only would these immortals be gone with a single strike, but his palace might also be gone.
 Gongshu Dijie looked at Ji Tianchang unhappily. It was his honor to let him run errands, and this mortal emperor still looked unwilling.
 This person from the lower realm really didn’t know how to respect immortals at all.
     

 Ji Tianchang called Yu Feng over and asked her to deliver the news to the Qingyun Sect. After all, Yu Feng was familiar with the route to the Qingyun Sect.
 After receiving the order, Yu Feng immediately rushed to the Qingyun Sect as soon as possible. She successfully met Ji Qinglan and informed him of the news.
 Knowing that guests from the Immortal Realm had occupied their Xi Liang Imperial Palace, Ji Qinglan was worried.
 “Is my father alright?” Ji Qinglan asked.
 “His Majesty is fine. They didn’t harm His Majesty! However, this group of people seem to be high and mighty. Even His Majesty has to kneel in front of them and serve them. I’m very displeased. These people are too arrogant. They simply treat us from the lower realm as ants!” Yu Feng said with a displeased expression.
 In her opinion, so what if he was an immortal? It was not like there were none in the Immortal Martial World.
 ‘Do you have to pretend like that? As if I’m a god who must be worshiped by mortals?’
 Yu Feng did not know when her opinion of immortals had changed.
 “Don’t worry, I’ll report this to the sect master now. He’ll definitely deal with it!” Ji Qinglan assured.
 Ji Qinglan quickly reported this matter to Li Yu, who was not surprised at all.
 After all, this was within his expectations.
 “Haha, you’re faster than I thought. A fish has taken the bait so quickly!” Li Yu laughed.
 He had asked Feng Xian to release the news that day precisely for this day.
 Li Yu’s words puzzled Ji Qinglan. He did not know what Li Yu was up to.
  “Sect Master, can I go with you?” Ji Qinglan asked. He was worried about his father and family.
 Although he had regained his memories from his previous life, the kinship in this life was real. He would not forget it.
 “Yes, of course. Let Elder Nie come with us!” Li Yu did not know what level the other party was at this time, so he decided to make a trip personally.
 If Elder Nie and Ji Qinglan could handle it, he would watch from the sidelines.
 If the person was strong, he would come out and control the situation.
 Furthermore, only he knew about this plan at the moment. It was too troublesome to let only Elder Nie and the others go while he had to explain to them.
 Li Yu quickly called for the purple lightning flood dragon and prepared to bring Elder Nie, Ji Qinglan, and Yu Feng to the Xi Liang Dynasty.
 He chose to ride the purple lightning flood dragon because this fellow had been to the Xi Liang Dynasty before and was familiar with it.
 Standing on the purple lightning flood dragon, Yu Feng had mixed feelings.
     

 She had experienced a similar scene before. At that time, she and her master had brought Li Yu to the Xi Liang Dynasty to capture him.
 However, times had changed. Looking back, it was really laughable.
 Now, everything had already changed drastically, and her state of mind was completely different. Other than reverence for Li Yu, she had no other feelings for him.
 The purple lightning flood dragon’s flying speed was very fast. It arrived in an instant.
 This time, the purple lightning flood dragon flew above the Xi Liang Imperial Palace, and Li Yu and the others jumped down.
 Then, he followed Yu Feng to the hall where Gongshu Dijie and the others were.
 “Your Majesty, Immortal Venerables, the Qingyun Sect has arrived for you!” Feng Yu walked into the hall and bowed with cupped hands.
 However, Gongshu Dijie, who was sitting on the dragon bed, instantly focused his gaze on Li Yu, Elder Nie, and Ji Qinglan, and his eyes immediately revealed surprise.
 The three people in front of him were simply too extraordinary.
 The moment he saw them, he suddenly felt as if he had seen his son and the elites of the sequence.
 After sensing the other party’s aura with his divine sense, Gongshu Dijie, who was sitting on the dragon bed, stood up.
 One of them was a Heaven Immortal, and the other was a Perfected Immortal.
 As for the person in the lead, he looked ordinary like a mortal from the aura.
 However, he was the most extraordinary one among the three.
 He emitted the power of the Great Dao around him, and there was even a dense Dao rune lingering on the surface of his body. He stood there silently, but he was still like the center of the world, impossible to ignore.
 Furthermore, facing Li Yu now gave him the illusion that he was facing the Heavenly Dao embodiment.
 In fact, they were even more nervous and afraid than facing their master.
 He even felt that he was like an ant in front of him. He felt his legs go weak, and he was filled with fear.
  Li Yu’s gaze swept around indifferently before finally stopping on Gongshu Yujie.
 On the way here, he had heard that Gongshu Dijie was the same as a certain Asgardian God. He liked to make mortals kneel in front of him and enjoy the feeling of being high and mighty and being worshiped.
 At the moment, everyone was kneeling in the hall. Even Ji Qinglan’s father was kneeling there.
 As Ji Qinglan’s senior brother and a member of the Immortal Martial World, he felt the need to avenge Ji Qinglan and the people from the lower realm.
 He wanted to give this self-righteous guest from the Immortal Realm a show of strength so that it would be easier for them to talk.
 “Kneel!” Li Yu’s voice was indifferent, but his words were law. The terrifying power of heaven and earth and the laws of the Great Dao instantly enveloped Gongshu Dijie.
 It was as if the sky was pressing down on him, causing his heart to tremble and his soul to leave his body. He knelt on the ground with a plop.
 The sound of the Great Dao made him dizzy and cold. His eyes were filled with shock and fear!
    
Chapter 235: I Must Be in the Wrong Place  Gongshu Dijie was completely dumbfounded. He knelt on the ground, his eyes filled with shock and fear.
 He felt that Li Yu was like a god, and he was that ant, that speck of dust.
 The instinctive reverence made his heart tremble in fear.
 The few immortals who accompanied him did not face Li Yu’s pressure directly.
 However, they were also shocked by Li Yu’s extraordinary appearance until their faces turned pale. Their legs went limp as they stood at the side and trembled.
 Furthermore, they could sense the extraordinary auras of the two people behind Li Yu. They were immortals countless times stronger than them.
 Li Yu was satisfied with Gongshu Dijie’s reaction, and he was also satisfied with his new ability. It was simply necessary to show off.
  He looked at Ji Tianchang and the others, who were still kneeling, and said, “No one says that mortals have to kneel to immortals. All of you, stand up!”
 Ji Qinglan hurriedly stepped forward to help his father up.
 Ji Tianchang was grateful. He knew that with Li Yu around, everyone in the Immortal Martial World could stand tall and live.
 This was also the reason why they could remain calm even when facing this group of immortals.
 Li Yu was the backbone of all life in this world.
 At this moment, the hearts of the Ji Family members present were heavy.
 Although they knew that Li Yu was extraordinary, it was satisfying to see that the high and mighty man, who had been bossy not long ago, was frightened to the point of kneeling on the ground by a single word from Li Yu.
 Li Yu looked away, and the pressure on Gongshu Dijie weakened significantly.
 Gongshu Dijie, who had recovered from his shock, only had one thought in his mind.
 I must be in the wrong place. This can’t be the lower realm.  How can there be such an extraordinary and terrifying expert in the lower realm?  Am I crazy? Or is the world crazy?  “Who are you?” Li Yu looked at Gongshu Dijie and asked.
 “We, we are members of the Gongshu family of the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm’s Ancient Family. We are here today to find the Sons of Destiny. Our family is willing to invite all the Sons of Destiny to become our Gongshu family’s retainers!” Gongshu Yujie replied with a trembling voice.
     

 “What level is your family in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm?” Li Yu asked.
 His words confirmed that this person was not from the Immortal Realm. This was even more shocking. How could there be such an extraordinary person in the lower realm?
 ‘Did times really change?’
 ‘Is the lower realm already filled with Golden Immortals and Saints?’
 However, he suddenly understood something.
 Why did those mortals not look at him with any shock or fear?
 They had already seen immortals and immortals stronger than him.
 “Immortal Venerable, our Gongshu family is one of the strongest families in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm. It’s also the top family!” Gongshu Yujie replied truthfully.
 He was not bragging. The Gongshu family was definitely the top family and one of the strongest factions in the current Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 “Hmm, not bad. Is your family searching for the Sons of Destiny?” Li Yu asked.
 “Indeed. Our master appreciates talent and is willing to recruit talented people to develop the family together…”
 “Yes, I admire talent too!” Li Yu nodded. “Which one of you has the lowest status in the family?”
 Li Yu’s unreasonable words puzzled everyone. They looked at each other. Who was willing to admit that their status in the family was low?
 However, in the face of Li Yu’s question, they immediately pushed out someone. “Him! He has the lowest status!”
 Li Yu looked at the guy who looked like a punching bag and said, “Go back and tell your family head that I want to make a deal with him. Now, there are one, two, three… five people here, so I’ll stay. Please invite him to bring the Sons of Destiny over for the exchange. One for each person, the time limit is… three months. Our sect doesn’t raise idle people. If it’s late, I’ll clean up the sect!”
 Li Yu’s words delighted the person who had been pushed out, and the expressions of Gongshu Yujie and the others changed drastically as they turned pale with fright.
 You call this a deal?  This is kidnapping and blackmail, okay?  What kind of trick is this?  Gongshu Dijie was stunned for a moment and could not react in time.
 Ji Qinglan, Elder Nie, Ji Tianchang, and the others looked at each other in surprise.
 They finally understood Li Yu’s intention for releasing the news. He also wanted to find those Sons of Destiny, but he was unwilling to search for them himself.
 Therefore, he took the opportunity to attract these powerful and well-connected Immortal Realm factions to serve as free labor for him.
 This method of getting something for nothing was really in line with his style.
     

 For some reason, Ji Tianchang and Yu Feng found this scene familiar.
 “Immortal Venerable, w-what do you mean by this?” Gongshu Dijie was dumbfounded. Were the tricks of the mortals in the lower realm so deep?
 Am I getting robbed instead of robbing?!  Furthermore, Gongshu Dijie was panicking. He knew that if the family head heard this news, he would definitely be furious and might even think that they were incompetent.
 He might become an abandoned son of the family and die here.
 “Shut up!” Li Yu’s order was repeated, and Gongshu Dijie was instantly silenced by an invisible force.
 “Did you hear what I said?” Li Yu looked at the Gongshu family’s punching bag and asked.
 “Remember, let our family use the Sons of Destiny to exchange for them. Don’t worry, Immortal Venerable. I’ll definitely report your words to our family master!” The punching bag suppressed his laughter, feeling like he was about to laugh out loud in the next second.
 “Okay, you may leave!” Li Yu said.
 The punching bag rushed out of the hall in high spirits and disappeared into the sky in the blink of an eye.
 Li Yu looked at the trembling Gongshu Yujie and the others with ugly expressions. “Don’t just stand there. Come with me!”
 Gongshu Dijie wanted to cry but had no tears. He was a Golden Immortal. He thought that he could dominate the lower realm and enjoy the benefits of power and status.
 In the end, he had not even enjoyed himself for three minutes before he became a prisoner who could not even keep his life.
 I have to think of a way to escape. I can’t just wait for death here!  He was well aware that the family head would never use the Sons of Destiny to exchange for them.
 The best outcome would probably be to send a Pseudo-Saint to save them.
 However, Li Yu’s strength might only be possible if the family head and the top few in the family came personally.
 Would the family head descend to the mortal world for a group of nobodies like them? Obviously not.
 Therefore, there was a high chance that they would be destroyed by Li Yu.
 Gongshu Dijie and the others were brought back to the Nine-tailed Mountain by Li Yu, but he did not bring them into the sect. Instead, he brought them to the mountain gate.
 After all, he did not want these people to know how extraordinary his sect was.
  “All of you can just stand here without moving!” Li Yu’s words were law.
 Their bodies instantly stiffened as if they were restrained by an invisible force and could not move at all. It was as if their bodies were no longer theirs, and even their eyeballs could not move.
 Other than his consciousness, he could not control any magic power or divine sense.
 They stood on the spot like statues.
 Ji Qinglan and Elder Nie were shocked by the changes in the few of them, but they knew that Li Yu had probably obtained another unbelievable reward from the Heavenly Dao.
 After all, they naturally sensed Li Yu’s extraordinary change.
 Li Yu nodded in satisfaction when he saw Gongshu Dijie and the others become statues. The combination of the Heart of Heaven and Earth and the Great Dao Golden Body was really interesting.
 It would be even more fun if he could obtain the Creator’s ability at some point. With a thought, he could turn these guys into pendants or bonsai plants.
    
Chapter 236: Bloodline Rankings  Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family, Stone Plain City’s City Lord Manor.
 “Heavenly Venerable Li Huo said that if the Flower Realm is really in the Jingxing Realm, he can agree to your request!” A man bowed and said.
 Upon hearing the man’s words, a smile surfaced on the City Lord’s face.
 “Very good! I, Gongshu Shituo, have finally found the day to hold my head high!” Gongshu Shituo was in a good mood.
 Gongshu Shituo was the city lord of one of the many cities controlled by the Gongshu family.
 As a direct descendant of the Gongshu family, his status in the family was not high. Their Stone Plain City was also the most remote and weakest among many cities.
 However, he was an ambitious person who valued power and status.
  Although his strength and ambition were not compatible, he had never been willing to give up. Fortunately, he had finally found an opportunity this time.
 A chance to prove himself to his family and turn things around.
 Furthermore, being able to establish a relationship with Heavenly Venerable Li Huo this time was what made him the happiest.
 …
 In the Qingyun Sect’s spirit herb garden, a group of beautiful demons chatted while watering the spirit herbs.
 “Haha, when I looked at the sect master’s left hand yesterday, I actually comprehended a very powerful palm technique divine art. I named it Fast Hands!” A beautiful cat girl said excitedly.
 “Fast Hands, it’s not nice. You should pick something like Dragon Claw Hand, Wandering Dragon Hand, Thunderbolt Claw, or something like that!” Another little butterfly demon remarked.
 “Sister Gu Yue, I heard that you comprehended the Great Bewitching Art from the sect master’s eyes. That’s awesome!” A little fox demon said enviously.
 “It’s a pity that no matter how powerful the charm technique is, it’s useless against our sect master!” Gu Yue said with a smile.
 She was too embarrassed to say that apart from comprehending the charm technique, she had also comprehended a water-type divine power.
 “I also comprehended a divine power with devouring power from the sect master’s mouth yesterday!”
 “All of you are so powerful. I didn’t comprehend any divine power, but when I looked at the sect master’s back, I comprehended a special concept. It was as if a voice was telling me, ‘I’ll buy a few oranges…'”
 “Speaking of oranges, I remember now. Do you know? I heard that Sister Mandarin was fortunate enough to serve the sect master in the Immortal Spring that day. She actually comprehended the art of blowing from the sect master.”
 “That’s right. I heard that Sister San Hua was fortunate enough to run to the sect master’s bed to sleep that day and comprehended the uniform sleeping technique in her sleep.”
 “I’m so envious of you guys. When will I be lucky enough to approach the sect master?”
     

 “Good news, good news! The sect master is soaking in the hot spring at the back mountain!” A golden-haired cat girl suddenly ran in and shouted.
 “Really? That’s great! Sisters, hurry up!” The demons were instantly excited!
 “Look at all of you. You’re about to drool!” The blonde cat girl had a teasing smile on her face. “I’m teasing you! Hahaha, hey, Little Qing, your skirt is wet!”
 Achoo!  Li Yu sneezed.
 He actually spat out a small bug. To Li Yu’s surprise, that small bug was still alive.
 It flew away at an extremely fast speed.
 ‘This little bug is really bold to crawl into my nose to cultivate. These demons are getting more and more impudent!’
 At the moment, Li Yu was sitting with Murong Xingqiao under the Ancient Dao Fortune Tree in the courtyard.
 They chatted as they drank the Dao Comprehension Tea.
 “The various large factions of the Immortal Realm have mobilized a large number of people and wasted money searching for the Sons of Destiny. Looks like this Great Dao inscription is extremely tempting to them!” Li Yu remarked.
 He was well aware that while these Immortal Realm factions claimed to recruit talents, they were probably scheming something.
 Perhaps some factions really wanted to recruit these children of the Heavenly Dao.
 However, humans were greedy. Those so-called immortals in the Immortal Realm were nothing much.
 They were not immortals who were truly detached from worldly matters. Their hearts were like clear mirrors, clear and lofty.
 Otherwise, he could find a mountain to cultivate in and ignore the outside world. He could enjoy peace alone.
 Establishing sects, family clans, and factions. On the surface, it was a competition for the Great Dao, but it was all driven by desire.
 Therefore, greed was inevitable. And when the temptation was big enough, everyone might develop inner demons.
 “Yes. After all, it’s a Dao Fruit Dharma Body. People in the Immortal Realm have cultivated for countless years, and that’s all they pursue. However, with billions of living beings cultivating painstakingly, they might only be able to chat with a few people. In the end, they might obtain the Great Dao and the Dao Fruit Dharma Body. Now that the Heavenly Dao has sent down a shortcut, who wouldn’t be tempted?” Murong Xingqiao said calmly.
 Li Yu’s expression remained the same, but he nodded to himself.
 These words were not like Murong Xingqiao.
 His guess was right. Murong Xingqiao had indeed changed. Her understanding and state of mind were no longer the same as the previous prince.
 Although this was related to his fusion with the Great Dao inscription, Li Yu could tell that Murong Xingqiao’s gaze had changed recently. Even her aura and expression had changed.
 This feeling was similar to Ji Qinglan back then, so Li Yu vaguely felt that Murong Xingqiao should have remembered something.
     

 Of course, the reason he paid attention to these was mainly because of the system mission notification.
 Murong Xingqiao’s Mystic Bird Palace mission had already begun, and there was more information about her character.
 Therefore, Li Yu guessed that Murong Xingqiao must have awakened the memories of her previous life.
 “Do you want to return to the Immortal Realm to take a look?” Li Yu suddenly asked for no reason.
 “Hmm! Hmm?” Murong Xingqiao was stunned after answering subconsciously.
 “Sect Master, you?” Murong Xingqiao was a little surprised.
 Li Yu smiled. “I remember something. Is it convenient to talk?”
 “Indeed, nothing can escape the sect master’s eyes!” Murong Xingqiao smiled, and then she told Li Yu some of the memories she had awakened.
 Ever since she fused with the Great Dao inscription and broke through to the Immortal Spirit Realm, some blurry memories had begun to appear in her mind.
 In fact, some vague memories had appeared in dreams in the past, but they only became clearer recently.
 As Murong Xingqiao told Li Yu about the memories she had, the power of heaven and earth fluctuated again.
 The golden light of the Heavenly Dao Rankings flourished.
 “The Bloodline Rankings are about to begin!” Li Yu and Murong Xingqiao looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 Their eyes were filled with anticipation. They wanted to see who could be on the rankings, and they were also looking forward to seeing how many people from their sects could be on it.
 At the same time, in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, the golden scroll of the Heavenly Dao Rankings also flourished with golden light. Countless people from the Immortal Realm focused their gazes on the Heavenly Dao Bloodline Rankings again.
 “The Bloodline Rankings are out too!”
 “The Bloodline Rankings shouldn’t be slaughtered by that strange faction in the lower realm again, right?”
 “Yes, most physiques are bestowed by the heavens. Lucky mortals might be lucky enough to obtain special and powerful physiques, but these bloodlines on the rankings require extraordinary opportunities to obtain!”
 “These bloodlines are the rarest and most powerful, especially the Ancestral Magus Bloodline. That’s a bloodline that not many people in our Immortal Realm possess!”
 “I can look forward to it again! I want to see which extraordinary people are on the rankings!”
  “Hmm, this ranking is also a silent competition between the various large factions!”
 As countless people discussed, golden light gathered below the 50th on the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings, and a name slowly surfaced.
 Bloodline Rankings # 50:?Yingzhao1?Bloodline
 Owner: Meng Xueqi
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Silence rang out.
 Countless people in the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm widened their eyes again.
 …
    
Chapter 237: Dominating the Rankings Again  Bloodline Rankings # 50:?Yingzhao1?Bloodline
 Owner: Meng Xueqi
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Low
 Reward: 100 years of cultivation, 30% increase in bloodline purity, 100% increase in bloodline power.
 Seeing that the first person on the Bloodline Rankings was from that lower realm faction, countless people from the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm could not remain calm anymore.
 He felt that this scene was familiar. Previously, the faction from the lower realm was ranked last on the Physique Rankings, and it was the same for the Bloodline Rankings.
  They suddenly had a feeling that history was about to repeat itself.
 “Another faction from the lower realm. Are they not going to let go of the Bloodline Rankings?”
 “What kind of faction is this? Why does it feel richer than those top factions in our Immortal Realm!”
 “Could this be the legendary hidden tycoon among the commoners?”
 “Did they dominate the rankings again this time?”
 “It can’t be, right? That would be too much!”
 “Don’t panic. It might not be as bad as we think. It might only be those in the back!”
 Seeing the strange and extraordinary name “That’s Quite a Large” again, countless living beings in the myriad worlds were interested again.
 This was especially true for many creatures of the lower realm, who were filled with anticipation and excitement.
 As mortals of the lower realm, they naturally hoped to see the powers of the lower realm crush the various heavens of the Immortal Realm.
 He hoped to see Li Yu’s mortal body shock the heavens and the myriad of immortals again.
 In the Qingyun Sect, Li Yu withdrew his gaze from the rankings.
 Seeing Meng Xueqi on the rankings, he could basically confirm that as long as one fused a drop of blood essence and obtained a portion of the bloodline power, he could enter the rankings.
 However, according to the amount of blood essence fused, there would be a difference in the purity of the bloodline.
 In that case, the Bloodline Rankings would definitely be their sect’s stage again.
 “Let’s continue!” Li Yu looked at Murong Xingqiao.
 Murong Xingqiao continued to talk about the memories that appeared in her mind.
 Li Yu roughly understood what was going on. As the system had introduced Murong Xingqiao, she was the master of the Mystic Bird Palace in the Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 However, according to her broken memories, the Mystic Bird Palace should have been destroyed. She could not remember the exact reason.
 Furthermore, she did not have a clear understanding of what kind of power and existence the Mystic Bird Palace was.
 After all, the memories she could remember now were still fragmented.
     

 “And this Mystic Bird Jade Pendant should have always existed in the depths of my soul. I only sensed it recently.”
 With a thought, golden light bloomed between Murong Xingqiao’s brows. Immediately, a Mystic Bird Jade Pendant flew out and landed in her palm.
 It was an ancient dark red jade pendant with a Mystic Bird carved on it. There was nothing special about it.
 “In the past, I once saw this jade pendant in my dream. It seemed to be floating in a dark void that could not be grabbed no matter what! Now, I can finally control it! In my broken memories, this jade pendant should be the key to a certain place in our Mystic Bird Palace!” Murong Xingqiao added.
 Li Yu nodded slightly. It seemed that this jade pendant was the key to this mission, just like how Ye Qiu obtained the Qing Cang Ancient Emperor’s treasure.
 The Bloodline Rankings continued to announce the owners of the various bloodlines on it.
 The various immortal realms took turns to enter the rankings, but no one from the lower realm entered.
 Furthermore, many of them had multiple people at the same time, with the highest number having more than ten.
 However, the purity of everyone’s bloodline was different.
 “Senior Brother, why are there so many people on each bloodline ranking?” Su Mu asked in confusion.
 Ji Qinglan explained, “Bloodlines are different from physiques. A person only needs to refine and fuse a portion of the blood essence of a divine beast or an Ancestral Magus to obtain the power of their bloodline. However, the purity will be different according to the amount of blood essence fused.
 It was clear that one could enter the rankings by possessing a portion of the bloodline power. That was why there were many people who possessed a particular bloodline.
 “Of course, a person can also fuse many bloodlines at the same time, but a person can only have one physique, and it’s a complete one. If it’s not complete, it won’t be on the rankings.”
 “Oh, so the purity of that bloodline is complete means that you’ve obtained a complete bloodline?”
 “That’s right. If you can fuse with a complete soul essence, you can basically obtain the complete bloodline power!” Ji Qinglan added.
 As time passed, the Bloodline Rankings gradually reached 35th place.
 Bloodline Rankings # 35: Suan Ni Bloodline
 Owner 1: Xin Ba
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
  Bloodline Purity: Complete
 Owner # 2: Mo Ai
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Mo Family
 Bloodline Purity: Low
 Owner 3…
 “As expected, this faction from the lower realm is on the rankings again!”
 The name of That’s Quite a Large appeared on the rankings again.
 Countless people in the Immortal Realm no longer seemed surprised, but they could not help but feel emotional.
 “It actually has a complete bloodline. This means that it’s a divine beast, the Suan Ni!”
 “I really suspect that this is a primordial faction from some Immortal Realm that went to the lower realm to play the pig to eat the tiger!”
 “It’s really possible!” Countless people from the Immortal Realm kept finding support for their mentality. Otherwise, they really felt that their understanding was about to collapse.
 They could never believe that a power from the lower realm could really have such an extraordinary person.
 However, when the bloodline rankings were announced to 30th place, they suffered another violent blow to their hearts.
     

 Bloodline Ranking # 30: Chao Feng Bloodline
 Owner 1: Tang Chi
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: High
 Reward: Complete bloodline, 500 years of cultivation…
 Owner 2: Huo Xing
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Phoenix Ancient Cave
 Bloodline Purity: Low
 Reward: Bloodline Purity increases by 50%, 300 years of cultivation…
 “It’s already the third one. That lower realm faction is already the third person on the rankings!”
 “And it actually has the high-purity divine beast Chao Feng bloodline. Even the ancient royal family only has low-purity bloodlines!”
 “Look at Tang Chi’s reward. It’s a complete bloodline. This lower realm faction has a second divine beast!”
 “It’s over. I suddenly feel that this lower realm faction is about to start slaughtering the rankings again!”
 Countless people in the Immortal Realm discussed, and their hearts ached.
 These bloodlines on the rankings were divine beasts that had appeared in ancient times. Many were born from heaven and earth, and most of them were already extinct.
 It was not easy to awaken or obtain the bloodline power and blood essence.
 It was something that could only be encountered by chance. Usually, only those top ancient families and eternal factions that had existed for countless years could obtain it.
 This was also why almost everyone on the rankings came from the top factions of the Immortal Realm.
 That was, apart from That’s Quite a Large.
 Bloodline Ranking # 20: Qilin Bloodline
 Owner 1: Guo Qilin
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Complete
 Reward: Bloodline power increases by 200%, three bloodline divine arts, bloodline limit increase by 200%
 Owner 2: Fire Qilin
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family
 Bloodline Purity: Complete
  Reward: Bloodline power increases by 200%, two bloodline divine arts, bloodline limit increase by 100%
 Owner #3: Jun Wanjie
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Jun Family
 Bloodline Purity: Medium…
 “Oh heavens, another one with a complete bloodline!”
 “This is unbelievable. This lower realm faction actually possesses an ancient divine beast Qilin!”
 “Have you noticed why Guo Qilin’s reward is so much better than the Fire Qilin’s? Why is the reward so pure?”
 …
    
Chapter 238: Collapse of Common Sense  Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, Gongshu Family.
 Seeing that Guo Qilin’s reward was clearly more generous than their Fire Qilin, everyone from the Gongshu family was unconvinced.
 They were both divine beast Qilins, so why were their rewards so different? The difference in the purity of their bloodlines was the reason for the difference in rewards.
 Why was there a difference this time?
 “Is the reward divided according to the owner’s strength?”
 “Even so, our Gongshu family’s Fire Qilin should be stronger. A divine beast Qilin from the lower realm is restricted by the laws of heaven and earth and spiritual energy. No matter what, it can’t be stronger than our Immortal Realm’s Qilin!”
 “That’s right, the difference in rewards is too great!”
  Everyone from the Gongshu family was filled with resentment.
 The Fire Qilin was standing behind Gongshu Qitian, its eyes filled with unwillingness.
 As the guardian divine beast of the Immortal Realm’s Ancient Family, he was naturally unconvinced that he had lost to the Qilin from the lower realm.
 However, even if he was dissatisfied, there was nothing he could do. After all, that was the Heavenly Dao. What could he do?
 “Are you unwilling to accept this?” Gongshu Qitian looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings expressionlessly and asked.
 “Yes!” The Fire Qilin nodded.
 He seemed to understand the unwillingness in his son’s heart when he saw the Physique Rankings.
 “I’m guessing it’s probably the difference in bloodline level. Although you’re both Qilin, there are differences in bloodline registration between divine beasts of the same type. For example, there are also different levels of azure dragons. This is like how we humans have a myriad of differences in talent despite being the same person!” Gongshu Qitian said.
 The Fire Qilin nodded slightly. In that case, he felt much better.
 “However, my Gongshu family’s Qilin must be the strongest. I’ve already sent people to search for that strange faction in the lower realm. When I find them, Guo Qilin’s bloodline will be yours!” Gongshu Qitian’s voice was indifferent, but his eyes were cold.
 He would never allow a power from the lower realm to trample on the dignity of the Gongshu family.
 In the inner hall of the Gongshu family.
 After Gongshu Jin heard the report of his subordinates who had just returned from the Jingxing Realm, his face darkened and his eyes were cold.
 “A sect in the lower realm has a saint? That’s impossible!” Gongshu Jin snapped, but he suddenly thought of that door.
 They wondered if Gongshu Dijie and the others had encountered that strange lower realm faction.
 However, even that strange lower realm faction could not have a Saint Realm expert.
 The spiritual energy and the laws of heaven and earth in the lower realm could never produce a Saint.
 Even a Perfected Immortal was already a chosen one who had seized the fortune of heaven and earth.
 Otherwise, the people of the lower realm would not have preferred to come to the bottom of the Immortal Realm and still choose to ascend there.
 “What’s that sect’s name?” Gongshu Jin asked.
     

 “It’s called the Qingyun Sect!” the man replied. He would remember this name even if he turned into ashes.
 ‘It’s not that strange faction? I must be thinking too much. This probably wasn’t done by the lower realm.’
 He knew that this child was worried that he would reprimand them for not doing their job properly and deliberately exaggerated it.
 However, the other party probably had a Heaven Immortal. Otherwise, Gongshu Dijie would not have been captured.
 However, even if it was a Heaven Immortal, it was impossible for him to be from the lower realm. Therefore, he guessed that it was most likely another immortal realm faction that was also from the lower realm to find the Sons of Destiny.
 In order to compete for the position of the chosen ones, he used despicable methods.
 “Master, they also said…” The man hesitated to speak and looked at Gongshu Jin’s expression.
 “What did you say? Stop hesitating!” Gongshu Jin said angrily.
 “They said that they wanted our family to use the Sons of Destiny to exchange for Lord Gongshu Yujie and the others. One Son of Destiny for one person!”
 “What!” Gongshu Jin slammed the table and stood up, his eyes widening in anger. “Who do they think they are? How dare they threaten my Gongshu family!”
 Upon hearing this, Gongshu Jin was even more certain that the other party was definitely a faction from an Immortal Realm pretending to be from the lower realm.
 Otherwise, how could the factions of the lower realm dare to be so presumptuous as to kidnap their Gongshu family and extort them?
 Furthermore, the ones who had the courage and strength to challenge the Gongshu family were likely some ancient families and eternal factions of the Luo Heaven Immortal Realm and the Mixed Heaven Immortal Realm.
 “Hmph, no matter who it is, you must be tired of living to blackmail my Gongshu family. You may leave first. I’ll send someone to the Jingxing Realm to settle this matter later!” Gongshu Jin said coldly.
 The dignity of the Gongshu family could not be trampled on. He did not care which family or faction the other party was from. Anyone who dared to offend their Gongshu family would only die.
 …
 The Bloodline Rankings in the sky was still updating new names.
 Bloodline Ranking # 18: White Tiger Bloodline
 Owner 1: White Emperor Heavenly Venerable
 Origin: Four Spirit Worlds
 Bloodline Purity: Complete
 Reward: Bloodline power increases by 200%, three bloodline divine arts, bloodline limit increase by 200%
 Owner 2: Mandarin
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Complete

 Owner #3: Dao Xuanzi
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Primordial Dao Immortal Sect
 Bloodline Purity: Medium
 Reward: Bloodline Purity increases by 50%, one bloodline divine art, 600 years of cultivation.
 “Another lower realm faction!” Countless people watching the rankings in the Immortal Realm were stirred up again.
     

 “This is already the fifth one, right? And this time, it’s a complete bloodline. The divine beasts, Suan Ni, Chao Feng, Qilin, and White Tiger. Is this really a faction from the lower realm?”
 “I feel like my common sense of the past five million years is about to collapse. So many divine beasts are actually in the hands of a lower realm faction.”
 “Impossible, absolutely impossible. This is definitely not a lower realm faction. The Heavenly Dao must have made a mistake!”
 “Yeah, how can a lower realm have so many powerful divine beasts!”
 Many people from the Immortal Realm could not believe this fact. They felt that their past knowledge had failed them.
 Netherworld Heaven Immortal Realm, Fallen God Palace.
 Fallen Divine Child stuck out his dark red tongue and licked his purple lips as he looked at the Heavenly Dao Rankings with a drooling expression.
 “So many tempting bloodlines. That’s Quite a Large. I must find this faction. My Fallen God Palace is going to be rich this time!” Fallen Divine Child said greedily.
 …
 In the Qingyun Sect, a group of cat girls surrounded the brown-haired cat girl and cheered when they saw her name on the rankings.
 “Sister Mandarin, you’re on the rankings!”
 “Is this the bloodline the sect master gave you? Divine beast White Tiger, Sister Mandarin, you’re so awesome!”
 “Alright, alright. You guys should work hard in your cultivation too. You should contribute more to our sect and be filial to the sect master. In the future, you will also become immortal and be rewarded by the sect master!” Mandarin said with a sweet smile.
 Her temperament was already very different from the other cat girls. Her entire figure had already become that of a fairy, but her figure was still very evil.
 As soon as she finished her sentence, the Heavenly Dao reward had already descended on her body. A dazzling golden light enveloped her graceful figure.

 Upon seeing the three thousand worlds, the people from That’s Quite a Large were on the rankings again. Countless people watching the rankings could not help but open their mouths again.
 They felt as if something called common sense had collapsed in their minds!
 …
    
Chapter 239: A Lower Realm Faction Challenging the Myriad Factions  This time, everyone from the Immortal Realm was at a loss for words.
 They felt as if a large rock had been stuck in their throats.
 The stone was called ‘That’s Quite a Large’.
 Their sense of superiority as people from the Immortal Realm had stepped on a big foot. The soles were cold, hard, and painful!
 For a moment, they were like soft persimmons that had been pinched. The wild horses that had been subdued could no longer stand still.
 They were filled with frustration.
 At this moment, any language seemed pale and meaningless.
  No words could explain what they had seen.
 They had no choice but to believe that the lower realm faction that dominated the Physique Rankings was also going to rule over the Bloodline Rankings this time.
 There were already six people from their factions on the rankings, and they were basically all complete. This was a little shocking.
 They could not understand why this was the case. Even with their countless years of experience and knowledge, they could not understand what they had seen.
 No one could explain everything clearly.
 Either the Heavenly Dao Rankings were joking with them, or everything they saw was an illusion.
 However, before they could recover from the impact of the Azure Dragon Bloodline.
 The new information about the person on the rankings ruthlessly attacked their souls and sense of superiority again.

 Owner 3…
 Blast!
 At this moment, everyone from the various Immortal Realms felt like they were about to split apart.
 This was especially true for the ancient families and eternal factions. They were already so jealous that they were about to turn sour.
     

 A mere lower realm faction already had seven people with complete bloodlines on the rankings. Five of them had complete bloodlines, and one had been rewarded with a complete bloodline.
 Even the top factions of the Immortal Realm, who thought they were rich and had plenty of talent, could not catch up.
 This caused their minds to explode.
 At this moment, the entire Gongshu family, the Situ family, the Qin family, the Ye family, the Mo family, and the other ancient families were silent. The word ‘bad’ was written on everyone’s faces!
 At this moment, the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings seemed to have become a one-man show for That’s Quite a Large.
 The other owners of the rankings seemed to have become accessories and punctuation marks.
 Even someone with a noble status like the Heavenly Venerable or the Realm Master seemed to be reduced to a green leaf under the dazzling light of that absurd sect.
 Everyone’s attention was focused on That’s Quite a Large.
 They were amazed by its extraordinary wealth.
 Bloodline Ranking # 14: Responding Dragon Bloodline
 Owner 1: Ao Ying
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Dragon King Hall
 Bloodline Purity: High
 Reward: Complete bloodline, three bloodline divine arts, 1000 years of cultivation. Bloodline limit increased by 200%
 Owner 2: Little Purple
 Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Low
 Reward: Complete bloodline, three bloodline divine powers, 2000 years of cultivation. Bloodline limit increased by 200%
 “Gasp!”
 When they saw the name again, countless living beings were already numb to it. Countless people in the Immortal Realm seemed to be used to it.
 However, when they saw Ao Ying and Little Purple’s rewards, they instantly exploded.
 This was especially true for the Dragon King Hall. Their voices of surprise and dissatisfaction were simply about to shatter the nine heavens.
 If anyone present could collect negative emotions to cultivate, they would probably reach the maximum level in one second.
 “On what basis? The rewards for our Divine Son’s high-level bloodline are inferior to that low-level bloodline from that lower realm faction!”
 “Yeah, there is a mistake with the Heavenly Dao Rankings!”
 One had a high-grade bloodline purity, while the other had a low-grade bloodline purity. Yet, they were both rewarded with a complete bloodline.
 Furthermore, that fellow from the lower realm had more cultivation rewards than Ao Ying by a thousand years.
 This was simply making things special.
 They could not understand.
 Could it be that the Heavenly Dao Rankings’ rewards depended on one’s identity besides bloodline?
 Even so, how could the mighty Young Master of the Dragon King Hall and the current Divine Son, Ao Ying, be inferior to a person from the lower realm?
     

 At the moment, Ao Ying felt uncomfortable as if she had eaten a fly. Her heart was in turmoil.
 He had already accepted the fact that someone from that faction in the lower realm was on the rankings at the same time as him.
 Furthermore, the other party had a low-grade bloodline purity while he had a high-grade bloodline purity. This made him heave a sigh of relief.
 He was not inferior to this person from the lower realm.
 Who would have thought that something would go wrong with the reward?
 This was simply equivalent to publicly humiliating him for being inferior to a fellow with a lower realm bloodline purity. Where would his face go?
 Wouldn’t he become the laughing stock of the world in the future?
 “Damn it, why!” Ao Ying’s fists cracked, and her eyes seemed about to spit fire.
 However, everyone from the Qingyun Sect was pleasantly surprised. They were also surprised by the reward given by the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 After all, his reward was indeed abnormal.
 “Haha, is Little Purple also favored by the Heavenly Dao?”
 “It’s probably our sect master’s blessing!”
 “Mm, that must be the reason. The Heavenly Dao might think that only true divine beasts are worthy of being our sect master’s mount!”
 …
 “Master, the rewards this time are really strange. Can you tell what’s going on?” A disciple asked in confusion.
 “There’s only one reason!” The Deva Sect Master stroked his beard and said confidently, “Because Little Purple is human, and Ao Ying’s original form is a black dragon!”
 “The Heavenly Dao blesses the human race, especially those who cultivate diligently. Think about Ao Ying. He came from a noble background, and he relied on the family’s resources to obtain his current achievements. I’m afraid that the Responding Dragon bloodline was exchanged with his family’s effort, and he only enjoyed the spoils of war.
 As for Little Purple, it was a mortal being who had to cultivate painstakingly to have the chance to fight against fate and obtain the fortune of heaven and earth. It had experienced countless life and death trials to obtain the blood essence of the Winged Dragon. As the saying goes, the Heavenly Dao rewards the diligent. That was why the Heavenly Dao Rankings gave it a reward even greater than the Black Dragon Race!
 “Therefore, you must work hard in your cultivation in the future. The heavens do not disappoint those who work hard. The Heavenly Dao Rankings are the best proof!”
 “Yes, we will follow your instructions!” All the disciples of the Immortal Cult replied in unison with excited expressions.
 …
 “Next is the Ancestral Magus Bloodline. Does that mean the lower realm also has the Ancestral Magus Bloodline?”
 “It’s hard to say now. I already suspect that our Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm is the lower realm!”
 “Here it comes. It’s time to announce the owner of Ancestral Magus Fu Zi’s bloodline.”
 Golden light gathered on the Heavenly Dao Rankings, slowly condensing new information.
 Bloodline Rankings # 13: Ancestral Magus Fu Zi’s Bloodline
 Owner: Feng Xian
  Origin: Three Thousand Worlds. That’s Quite a Large
 Bloodline Purity: Medium
 “Indeed, we’re probably living in a fake Immortal Realm!”
 Countless people from the Immortal Realm could only laugh at themselves bitterly.
 There were already a few bloodline owners who were from That’s Quite a Large Sect. Even their people were on the rankings for the rarer Ancestral Magus bloodline.
 Furthermore, there was only one owner this time.
 This time, it was really a one-man show. They could only look up to it.
 …
    
Chapter 240: Tragedy in the Mortal World  Chaotic Star Domain, Demon God Hall.
 The Demon Lord Ji Xingzi stood on the Demon Abyss Platform with the Demon Venerables and Demon Sons of the various Demon God Halls.
 They waited for the next bloodline owner to be announced.
 Yesterday, he had just completely fused with the Xuanming blood essence that his beloved disciple, Mo Fei, had obtained from the Primordial Battlefield.
 The next 12th place was the owner of the Xuanming Ancestral Magus Bloodline.
 This time, the names of Ji Xingzi and the Demon God Hall would definitely enter the rankings and shine.
 To the Demon God Hall, this was a moment of glory that would enter the annals of history.
  “It’s all thanks to Mo Fei that I can obtain the blood essence of the Ancestral Magus Xuanming this time!” said the Demon Lord Ji Xingzi in a low voice.
 Then, he looked at Mo Fei, one of the Demon Sons, and said, “In the future, the Demon Seeking Hall will be under your control. I will officially confer you the title of Demon Venerable Fei Qiu. Don’t disappoint me!”
 “Thank you, Your Majesty. I will not disappoint you and bring our Demon God Palace to greater heights!” Mo Fei was overjoyed and immediately knelt and kowtowed in thanks.
 The other Demon Sons were also jealous. Unfortunately, they did not have the ability to obtain the blood essence of an Ancestral Magus from the Primordial Battlefield like Mo Fei.
 He could even appease this suspicious master of his. Now that he had successfully become a hall master, his future would definitely be limitless.
 “The person on the rankings is about to be announced!” A faint smile surfaced in Ji Xingzi’s eyes.
 Everyone held their breaths and focused their attention on the Heavenly Bloodline Rankings as they began to think of the congratulatory words.
 Bloodline Ranking # 12: Ancestral Magus Xuanming Bloodline
 Owner: Jun Wuhui
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Jun Family
 Bloodline Purity: Medium
 Reward…
 Bloodline Ranking # 11: Ancestral Magus Gonggong Bloodline
 Owner 1: Mo Chen
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Mo Family
 Bloodline Purity: Medium
 Reward: Bloodline Purity increases by 50%, Cultivation increases by 1000 years, Bloodline Power increases by 200%
 Owner 2: Tian Yunzi
 Origin: Nine Heavens Immortal Realm, Nameless Sect…
 At this point, everyone from the Demon God Hall swallowed the congratulations they were about to say. All of them had strange expressions and were silent.
 They looked at each other and then at the gloomy Demon Lord Ji Xingzi.
 Mo Fei’s face was filled with panic as he looked at the rankings in disbelief.
 “Why isn’t the Demon Lord’s name here? Impossible!” Mo Fei’s expression was ugly as he panicked.
     

 He knew that Ji Xingzi was suspicious by nature, had a bad temper, and loved face.
 He was already skeptical when he offered his blood essence previously. Furthermore, it was strange. After fusing with the blood essence, not only did his strength not improve, but he also felt uncomfortable.
 If he was not his most trusted disciple, he would probably not have survived until now.
 Now that the owner of this bloodline did not have his name, he would probably not be able to explain himself.
 Sensing the pressure of Ji Xingzi locking onto him, Mo Fei’s expression changed drastically as he knelt on the ground. “Lord, please calm down. Listen to me…”
 Blast!
 A terrifying magic power instantly swept toward Mo Fei. His expression changed drastically, and he wanted to dodge, but it was too late.
 The Demon Lord was too powerful. Now, this furious strike had directly destroyed Mo Fei’s body and soul.
 Upon seeing this, everyone knelt on the ground in fear, trembling and not daring to make a sound.
 Some Demon Sons glanced at Mo Fei’s body that had turned into ashes, and the corners of their mouths twitched as they trembled.
 As the saying went, accompanying a ruler was like accompanying a tiger. This was especially true for the hot-tempered Ji Xingzi.
 It was a pity that Mo Fei’s flattery had hit the nail on the head and cost him his life.
 …
 Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm, Ancient Family—Mo Family.
 When they saw their son, Mo Chen, on the rankings, the Mo Family residence was in an uproar, even though they knew this was the truth.
 Meanwhile, Mo Chen was in the study. He held a Mystic Bird Jade Pendant in his right hand and examined it carefully with a complicated expression as if he was examining a beauty.
 If Li Yu and Murong Xingqiao were here, they would definitely recognize that this jade pendant was almost identical to Murong Xingqiao’s Mystic Bird Jade Pendant.
 “Lord Divine Son!” A figure appeared out of thin air in the study. He wore a mask and black clothes as he bowed with cupped hands.
 “You brought it back?” Mo Chen asked casually, his gaze still fixed on the jade pendant.
  Although Mo Chen’s limelight and strength could not compare to Gongshu Qitian and Qin Feng, he was still an extraordinary person.
 Furthermore, he kept a low profile and rarely interacted with the disciples of the various families and factions.
 If not for the appearance of the Sons of Heaven Rankings, almost no one would have known his true strength.
 “My lord, we’ve brought the items back. According to your instructions, we’ve killed all the mortals and living beings in the Azure Sky Sect and the surrounding 5,000 kilometers. No one survived!” the black-robed man reported.
 “Very good. You may leave!” Mo Chen said and continued to examine the Mystic Bird Jade Pendant in his hand.
 This was the jade pendant he had obtained by chance. This was the jade pendant that had appeared in his dreams countless times. There was also the person wearing this jade pendant. Her appearance could not be seen clearly, but it always tugged at his heartstrings, as if it was an unforgettable beautiful figure.
 Everything was waiting for him to slowly unravel.

 Owner #3: Heavenly Venerable Li Huo
 Origin: Li Fire Realm
 Bloodline Purity: Medium…
 When they saw the people from That’s Quite a Large on the rankings again, everyone from the various immortal realms was already expressionless, and their minds were numb.
 The Bloodline Rankings had already been dominated by this lower realm faction. It was as if the various factions of the myriad worlds were competing with this lower realm faction.
 However, they seemed to be inferior.
 If not for the Heavenly Dao Rankings, they might never have imagined that a group of high and mighty Immortals, Saints, and Heavenly Venerables would be robbed of their limelight by a group of mortals from the lower realm.
 The number of powerful physiques and bloodlines possessed by a lower realm faction was almost surpassing the entire Forsaken Heaven Immortal Realm.
 If they had not seen it with their own eyes, they would not believe it even if their father told them.
 What was happening in front of them was definitely the most unbelievable and shocking unsolved mystery they had ever seen in their lives.
 It was even more incomprehensible than the appearance of the Heavenly Dao Rankings.
 However, they could only accept what they could not understand. This was the process of living beings adapting to the world.
 Just like how humans could not understand the existence of heaven and earth and the passage of time, they could only accept this setting for the time being.

 Reward: Bloodline Purity increases by 60%, Cultivation increases by 1200 years, Bloodline Limit increases by 200%

 “R-Ruler is on the rankings!”
 When they saw Ji Xingzi’s name appear on the rankings, everyone from the Demon God Hall had complicated expressions and fell silent.
 The corners of Ji Xingzi’s mouth twitched, and his gaze was complicated as if his heart was being stabbed.
 It turned out that Mo Fei did not lie to him. He did not give him the fake blood essence that wanted to harm him, but the blood essence had the wrong name.
  He really regretted it now. No matter what, Mo Fei was the most loyal among his many disciples and the only one he could trust.
 Yet, he had killed him personally.
 ‘I… I was too impulsive.’
 ‘My beloved disciple! I’ve let you down!’
 Ji Xingzi wailed in his heart and cried with regret, but he still pretended that nothing had happened.
 He had to finish the path he had walked no matter what.
 “Men, bury Mo Fei properly. He will keep the title of Demon Venerable Fei Qiu and be added to the position of the Demon God Hall!” Ji Xingzi ordered.
 …

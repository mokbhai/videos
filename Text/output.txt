 Chapter 301: War in the Celestial Realm (End)  The wooden-faced old man was forced to disintegrate into the Dao by Lin Jiufeng. His cultivation base transformed into rain that fell down, looking very beautiful.
 But this beauty made one feel cold all over, without a trace of warmth, especially in the Celestial Realm.
 The remaining immortals were currently silent from Lin Jiufeng’s feat.
 Disintegrate into the Dao!
 This word was something very distant to the immortals in the Celestial Realm.
 After breaking through to the Immortal Realm, who would be willing to disintegrate into the Dao?
 Who would want to disintegrate into the Dao?
 Who could make them disintegrate into the Dao?
 The immortals had never thought of this matter. They believed that the so-called Dao Disintegration was very, very far away from them.
 But now, they saw with their own eyes that there was actually someone who could forcefully make them disintegrate into the Dao.
 Hundreds of ordinary immortals were forced to disintegrate into the Dao together.
 Even an immortal who had unlocked the Nine Restrictions was no exception. He was also easily disintegrated into the Dao.
 The remnants of the Immortal Court were stunned.
 Leading this group of remnants were the Seven Great Elders. Each of them was very domineering, deciding everything in the Celestial Realm.
 But now, facing Lin Jiufeng, they had only fought for a short while, but one of them was already dead and the other was seriously injured.
 What’s more, the one who died was one of the most powerful elders. He couldn’t escape the danger of Dao Disintegration even after unlocking the Nine Restrictions.
 Raindrops fell from the sky.
 Some people raised their heads and looked at the sparkling raindrops, feeling despair in their hearts.
 “You… You didn’t break the threshold of the Immortal Realm or unlock the Nine Restrictions. Then, why are you so powerful?” An elder’s voice trembled as he asked with an ugly expression.
 The others also wanted to know too. They stared at Lin Jiufeng, shocked.
 Lin Jiufeng stood on the General Appointing Platform, becoming the center of attention of the entire Celestial Realm.
 He answered this question, “Because when you all break through to the Immortal Realm, you all chose the path of transcending the tribulation or by transcending the mortal world. I’m different from you all. I chose to ascend to an immortal in the secular world, the things that I comprehend and the difficulties that I encounter are ten or a hundred times more difficult than you all. Isn’t it normal for me to be ten or a hundred times stronger than you all after breaking through?”
 The faces of the immortals in the Celestial Realm twitched. When they heard this, they were very speechless.
 “Ascending to an immortal in the secular world, this is usually something used to deceive others. You actually succeeded?” The seriously injured old man in black trembled as he looked at Lin Jiufeng, his face filled with horror.
 “Yes, that’s why I came here.” Lin Jiufeng nodded and looked at them.
 “You’ve already ascended to an immortal in the secular world, why are you still targeting our Celestial Realm? We’ve always been aloof from the world, never interfered with the matters of the mortal world, and we’ve never offended you before.” The black-robed old man asked angrily.
 “Indeed, you lot have never offended me. I haven’t even heard of you all before I became an immortal,” Lin Jiufeng said honestly.
 “Then why are you targeting the Celestial Realm and fighting your way in?” An old man in green clothes gritted his teeth and asked.
 “Why?” Lin Jiufeng smiled.
 “There is no love or hatred for no reason in this world. Although we have never met and there is no hatred between us, sometimes, it’s exactly like this that the two of us are in a situation where we will fight to the death,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “Why?” The old man in black asked angrily.
 “Ever since the founding of the Celestial Realm, we have been standing here, aloof from worldly affairs,” the black-robed old man said.
 “Stand aloof from worldly affairs?” Lin Jiufeng smiled.
 It was disdain, a cold smile, and an angry smile.
 “You lot are aloof from worldly affairs, but have you forgotten how the Celestial Realm was built?” Lin Jiufeng sneered.
 The remnants of the Immortal Court looked at Lin Jiufeng. Their hearts skipped a beat.
 “The establishment of the Celestial Realm was because you stole the source energies of the main world, causing the main world to lack this source energies and producing a spiritual energy tide. Every few thousand years, this spiritual energy tide would repeat itself. The people of the main world are in distress, but you lot are standing aloof from the world.”
 “You don’t think it’s sarcastic?”
 “Your aloofness from worldly affairs comes from exploiting the people of the main world.”
 Lin Jiufeng sneered and said.
 “We obtained it with our own capabilities. What do you mean by stealing?” The old man in black said angrily.
 “Yes, the weak are prey to the strong. What right does that group of mortals have to enjoy so many source energies of the main world?”
 “It belonged to the Immortal Court in the first place. As descendants of the Immortal Court, we naturally have the right to take away the source energy of the world.”
 The elders of the Immortal Court said angrily.
 They thought that Lin Jiufeng was being a busybody. He actually came to the Celestial Realm for the sake of mortals and wanted to take back the world’s source energies.
 Dream on!
 Once the source energies of the Celestial Realm were taken away, the Celestial Realm would no longer exist.
 They hated Lin Jiufeng to death for being a busybody.
 When Lin Jiufeng heard what they said, his brows were tightly furrowed. He was very angry, and his face was livid.
 “Then, me entering the Celestial Realm and killing you all now is also just the survival of the fittest, right?”
 “In any case, according to what you all said, it’s not wrong for you all to steal the world’s source energies. Then, it’s also not wrong for me to enter the Celestial Realm and kill all of you. After all, the weak are prey to the strong.”
 “You lot actually still think that the source energy of the main world belongs to you? The Immortal Court has long been wiped out. You guys aren’t high and mighty anymore. You are just weak immortals who hide in the Celestial Realm and don’t dare to leave. Yet, you guys even dare to be so arrogant. Who gave you the confidence to do so?”
 “Today, either let me kill all of you and disintegrate you all into the Dao, then crush the Celestial Realm, or you all obediently hand over all this world’s source energies now. There is no third path.”
 Lin Jiufeng stood on the General Appointing Platform, his clothes fluttering, his expression cold, not giving the other party any extra choice.
 There were only two paths.
 As soon as these words came out, the old and young members of the Immortal Court jumped up in anger. This wasn’t an option, this was forcing them.
 “All the immortals, attack together. I don’t believe that a few thousand immortals won’t be enough to kill this fanatic,” the old man in black bellowed.
 He wanted all the immortals to attack Lin Jiufeng together.
 But only a portion of people moved.
 The old and young descendants of the Immortal Court were very proactive. They relied on the world’s source energies to be carefree, so they naturally wouldn’t agree to hand over the world’s source energies.
 But the immortals who had joined later were persuaded by Zhou Qing to rebel.
 None of them moved!
 All of them were watching the show. They even retreated and moved aside, clearly indicating that they didn’t want to participate.
 While Lin Jiufeng was fighting, Zhou Qing wasn’t idle. He brought the spiritual liquid spring to these people and convinced them not to interfere.
 When these people saw how powerful Lin Jiufeng was, forcing people to disintegrate into the Dao, they no longer had any desire to fight. Now that they saw that Zhou Qing had obtained the spiritual liquid spring that they needed, they agreed without hesitation.
 Hence, when the old man in black shouted, only the descendants of the Immortal Court were mobilized. This group of immortals moved away and watched the battle, staying out of it.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t need their help. It was good as long as they didn’t attack him too and increase his troubles.
 “Since you lot don’t want to choose, I will choose for you,” Lin Jiufeng said solemnly.
 Boom!
 Light burst from his entire body as he directly erupted. The General Appointing Platform also displayed its might and attacked together.
 In front of him, a blazing light soared, blowing up many ancient mountains in the Celestial Realm. Large pieces of majestic mountains exploded, great rocks collapsing the clouds!
 This terrifying energy swept in all directions. Lin Jiufeng stretched out his hand and spread his five fingers. When they fell, a huge cage appeared.
 Drawing a Cage in Space!
 The world, time, and space were all sealed.
 The remnants of the Celestial Realm were shocked. They looked around, trying their best to break this seal. But it was useless.
 What kind of unforeseen event was this?
 Lin Jiufeng and the General Appointing Platform worked together against these remnants of the Immortal Court.
 Then, the rumbling energy surged out from the depths of the earth, erupting with terrifying power.
 Rubble shot through the air. The immortal light was like raging waves slapping the shore. Boundless chaos exploded, and the ancient mountains were torn apart.
 The remnants of the Immortal Court suffered a huge blow.
 Lin Jiufeng wasn’t idle either. Behind him, his God’s Domain spread. In the domain, music that scared the remnants sounded.
 First Music of the 12 Music of the Gods: “Overture of the Gods”.
 When this music sounded, it caused a shock to the remnants of the Immortal Court. The Overture of the Gods that descended made these remnants go crazy.
 “The Gods…”
 “This is the music of the Gods. You actually belong to the God Race?”
 “It’s the Gods, damn it. They were the ones who destroyed the Immortal Court.”
 “Didn’t the Gods completely disappear in the long river of history along with the Immortal Court?”
 “The Gods, it’s actually the Gods. Damn it, damn it, damn it!”
 …
 The remnants of the Immortal Court were angry, terrified, furious, and scared…
 All sorts of emotions appeared.
 They were truly afraid of the Gods from the bottom of their hearts.
 It was the Gods who had overthrown their Immortal Court. Many old people had personally witnessed the might of the Gods.
 They thought that by hiding in the Celestial Realm, they wouldn’t be able to encounter the Gods.
 But who would have thought that Lin Jiufeng would actually bring the ‘Overture of the Gods’?
 “Overture of the Gods” reverberated through the air and landed in the picturesque prison. It made the remnants tremble. They felt very uncomfortable and resisted with difficulty.
 Lin Jiufeng’s expression was solemn. He once again executed a move from the 12 Music of the Gods.
 Seventh Music of the 12 Music of the Gods: “Roar of the War God”.
 This was the first time he used this move. The previous enemies weren’t worthy for him to use this move, but now, he could use it.
 After all, the Immortal Court and the Gods were existences that would fight to the death.
 The Immortal Court was destroyed by the Gods.
 The Immortal Court collapsed. The battle between the top powerhouses of the Immortal Court and the Gods was definitely exciting.
 Among them, “Roar of the War God” was a mass killing machine.
 Behind Lin Jiufeng, a War God appeared. He was dressed in armor and had a determined gaze. His entire body flowed with the radiance of divinity. He was three thousand feet tall and held a spear. He suddenly roared.
 Roar!!!
 The boiling divine charm was like the raging waves of the sea. It folded hundreds of layers at once and then slapped out.
 It caused the destruction of the world!
 This roar directly caused the space to collapse, the chaotic streams to surge, and endless power to spread. Then, it landed on the body of the remnants of the Immortal Court.
 Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
 One by one, the remnants of the Immortal Court directly exploded without any resistance.
 In front of the “Roar of the War God”, they had no ability to resist at all.
 At this moment, the Celestial Realm was torn apart by the “Roar of the War God”. Lin Jiufeng saw the source energies of the main world hidden behind the Celestial Realm.
 Something thick and huge, like grains, was gathered together. It was like a resplendent galaxy in the starry sky, surrounding the Celestial Realm.
 The remnants of the Immortal Court, regardless of their strength, instantly exploded at this moment. They had no ability to resist.
 As for Lin Jiufeng, he gasped for breath. Standing on the General Appointing Platform, his body turned soft from being empty of energy.
 This roar directly depleted all the energy in his body.
 But its might was also pleasing to the eyes. It wiped out this group of remnants who were like parasites.
 Lin Jiufeng chuckled. “As expected, the greatest enemy of the Immortal Court is the Gods.”

                    



 Chapter 302: One of the Nine Cauldrons  A great roar sounded, shaking the Celestial Realm, making these remnants all explode, dying on the spot.
 This was a terrifying scene that was deeply imprinted in the hearts of the other immortals.
 A shocking scene.
 The roar of the War God almost shattered their divine souls. Each of them was shocked.
 The huge phantom of the War God slowly dissipated.
 The God’s Domain, Sea Rising Bright Moon, and the Immortal King Attacking the Nine Heavens also disappeared together.
 Lin Jiufeng stood on the General Appointing Platform and looked around as he slowly floated down and landed.
 The remnants of the Immortal Court were shattered by the roar. A huge amount of energy disintegrated into the Dao and fell like rain, diverse and beautiful.
 This beauty carried a trace of blood.
 Even though Lin Jiufeng was very weak now, no immortal dared to look him in the eye.
 They were scared witless!
 These immortals were really afraid of Lin Jiufeng now.
 He single-handedly swept through the Celestial Realm and killed all the remnants of the Immortal Court.
 Was this something a single human could do?
 Only Zhou Qing’s face was red with excitement. All his hair stood on end.
 He had bet on the right person.
 This Great Emperor Jiufeng who killed him and resurrected him was really powerful enough to sweep through the Celestial Realm alone.
 He was free. How could Zhou Qing not be excited?
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, you are too amazing.” Zhou Qing was thrilled as he said loudly. He was convinced by Lin Jiufeng’s strength and almost prostrated himself in worship.
 Zuo Muyun, who was in the crowd, also watched excitedly. He was indeed right. The Son of Destiny of this era was Great Emperor Jiufeng.
 He was very proud and excited to become friends with Great Emperor Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng’s pores were all absorbing the immortal energy in the air. He recovered some of his energy and put away the General Appointing Platform. He landed on the ground and looked at Zhou Qing.
 “From now on, let these immortals leave the Celestial Realm and enter the mortal realm,” Lin Jiufeng said to Zhou Qing.
 Zhou Qing nodded. “That’s not a problem. Everyone has been trapped here for more than 10,000 years. They all want to leave and go to the outside world.”
 “After leaving the Celestial Realm, don’t allow them to make trouble in the mortal realm. Tell them that I’m from the Yuhua God Dynasty and that I’m protecting the Human Race. If anyone dares to make trouble, I will kill them,” Lin Jiufeng said coldly.
 Zhou Qing smiled. “Sir, after witnessing your combat power just now, no one will do anything stupid. Even if they enter the mortal world, they will still be obedient.”
 “That’s good. Let them leave first. It’s time for this Celestial Realm to be destroyed. I want to bring the source energies of the world back to the mortal realm and let the mortal realm maintain its peak and restore the glory of the ancient era.” Lin Jiufeng nodded and waved Zhou Qing away to handle this matter.
 Zhou Qing immediately gave the order to the other immortals. Relying on Lin Jiufeng’s might, no one dared to disobey him. Moreover, after staying in the Celestial Realm for so many years, everyone wanted to go out and take a look, so no one refused.
 Zhou Qing had control of the Immortal Road. He opened the road and let the thousand or so immortals go out.
 Before leaving, Zhou Qing told them all the things to take note of after entering the mortal realm.
 Then, he said something.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng is the Great Emperor of the Human Race, the Great Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty. You guys should take note of this.”
 The immortals all gasped. No one dared to offend Lin Jiufeng.
 They had personally witnessed how Lin Jiufeng destroyed the remnants of the Immortal Court.
 Even if they had a few more guts, they wouldn’t dare to offend Lin Jiufeng.
 The immortals left one after another, leaving only Zuo Muyun and Zhou Qing.
 Zuo Muyun looked at Lin Jiufeng and said happily, “You are becoming stronger and stronger.”
 Lin Jiufeng smiled and answered, “It’s been tough on you for the past three months.”
 Zuo Muyun came here in place of the little white cat. Lin Jiufeng was very grateful to him.
 “It’s not tough at all. I’m also very honored to see the last of the Immortal Court’s power being wiped out and be a witness to this history.” Zuo Muyun shook his head and said with a smile.
 “You and Zhou Qing should go out too. After I recover, I will crush the Celestial Realm and integrate the source energies of this world into the mortal realm, allowing the main world to return to its previous state like 20,000 years ago. The two of you have to work hard. There are chances for you both to improve. The main world is about to welcome its long-lost peak.” Lin Jiufeng reminded the two of them.
 “We will work hard.” Zuo Muyun and Zhou Qing nodded at the same time and remembered it in their hearts. Everyone wanted to improve. After entering the Immortal Realm, they wanted to break the shackles of the Immortal Realm, enter the Nine Restrictions, and then aim towards the next realm. This was just human nature.
 Lin Jiufeng watched as the two of them left. He looked at the huge Celestial Realm, only he was left. The distant mountains were in chaos, the sky split open, and this world’s source energies were right in front of him.
 He sat cross-legged in meditation, frantically absorbing the immortal energy to improve himself and reach his next goal.
 The Nine Restrictions!
 The current Lin Jiufeng wasn’t far from unlocking the Nine Restrictions, and he had only briefly touched the threshold of the Nine Restrictions when using the Wrath of the War God just now.
 “The wooden-faced old man was able to enter the Nine Restrictions by self-mutilating. He destroyed his own eyes and used his great willpower to break through the Nine Restrictions. But this method is very extreme. It’s not very suitable for me.”
 “I just have to follow the prescribed order and improve myself. I will use my powerful strength and invincible Dao to forcefully unlock the Nine Restrictions.”
 While Lin Jiufeng pondered this in his mind, the surging immortal energy entered his body and quickly re-energized him.
 His powerful strength returned once again.
 “The 12 Music of the Gods is indeed powerful. With a roar, it sapped my strength. If I were to execute them all, how terrifying would that be?” Lin Jiufeng smiled happily.
 All this time, he had treated the 12 Music of the Gods as his trump card. Until now, he still thought so.
 And the 12 Music of the Gods didn’t disappoint him.
 “The powerful gods actually perished together with the Immortal Court. It can be seen how terrifying the Immortal Court was back then. It’s far from what these descendants can compare to.” Lin Jiufeng wasn’t proud of his victory at all.
 He was very solemn. He even knew very clearly that he was still very weak.
 In the current era, he was indeed very powerful. He could be said to be the number one expert in the current era.
 But compared to the Immortal Court, the God Race, and some top powerhouses in history, he was far inferior.
 He still needed to continue improving.
 Tonight, Lin Jiufeng spent the time cultivating.
 The next day, when the morning sun rose, Lin Jiufeng reached out and held the first ray of sunlight. Then, he stood up, his aura pouring out from his body.
 Nine Restrictions of the Immortal Realm!
 He unlocked them.
 Stepping into the Nine Restrictions realm, he opened a new world. Lin Jiufeng was a small character in this world. There were countless apprehensive paths ahead that he needed to walk on.
 Next, Lin Jiufeng looked at the cracked void.
 Outside the void, a boiling world source surrounded this Celestial Realm.
 There were so many source energies in this world, it was no wonder that there was an energy tide in the mortal realm.
 “Now, we have to solve this problem,” Lin Jiufeng muttered.
 But in the very next moment, a line of words appeared before his eyes.
 [Do you want to Sign-In before the source energy of the world?]
 Lin Jiufeng wasn’t surprised. He said, “Sign in!”
 [Sign-In successful. Received one of the Nine Cauldrons!]
 Lin Jiufeng’s expression froze. What treasure was this?
 He quickly checked the information.
 [In the distant era, there was a celestial who created the Nine Cauldrons to suppress the source energy of the world. But later on, due to the war and various reasons, the Nine Cauldrons shattered and disappeared. This was one of them.]
 This was the only message, but it revealed many things.
 In the distant era of the past, there was a celestial who created the Nine Cauldrons to suppress the source energy of the world.
 What era was this distant era from?
 Also, why did the Nine Cauldrons disappear?
 Lin Jiufeng needed to investigate these problems thoroughly.
 He took a deep breath. “We will investigate the problem in the future. The most important thing now is to keep this cauldron and then return to the mortal realm with the source energies of the main world.”
 Dong!
 In the very next moment, a huge bronze cauldron appeared in the air. It was ancient and majestic, and its design was retro. It was very different from the modern cauldron. There were mountains and rivers carved on it, the mountains and rivers of the mortal realm.
 Lin Jiufeng reached out and grabbed it. True Qi seeped into the core area, and he instantly saw an ancient continent.
 One of the nine provinces of the ancient era.
 The Nine Cauldrons represented the nine provinces. At the core of each cauldron was a continent, which was the source energy of the Nine Cauldrons.
 Lin Jiufeng refined this cauldron and threw it into this world’s source energy.
 “Absorb!”
 Lin Jiufeng shouted coldly.
 Rumble!
 The cauldron frantically absorbed this world’s source energy. The vast source energy entered the core of the cauldron obediently, like a child who had encountered his mother.
 The source energy that surrounded the Celestial Realm was slowly shrinking.
 Bit by bit, the source energies were absorbed by the cauldron in front of Lin Jiufeng.
 The crack in the Celestial Realm’s sky became even larger.
 It was as if it had been torn apart.
 Seeing this, Lin Jiufeng said, “The establishment of the Celestial Realm itself is a mistake. This mistake has lasted for more than 10,000 years, it’s time to correct it.”
 Ka ka ka!
 The tear in the Celestial Realm continued. At this moment, the mountains and rivers directly collapsed, turning into pure source energy that was absorbed into the cauldron.
 The Celestial Realm transformed into pure source energy.
 Lin Jiufeng stood in the starry sky. Beneath him was the vast main world.
 The galaxy was vast and silent. When the cauldron absorbed the last wisp of the Celestial Realm’s source energy and returned to Lin Jiufeng’s hand, it quickly shrank, becoming a unique small tripod.
 Lin Jiufeng returned to the mortal realm with it.

                    



 Chapter 303: Detailed Discussions  Descending from the starry sky, Lin Jiufeng returned to the imperial capital with the world’s source energy.
 Standing outside the imperial capital, he saw the intensity of the world’s energy tide.
 The wind and clouds surged. The spiritual energy in the air was surging, and immortal energy was born. Moreover, it was increasing every moment.
 “It seems that the influence of the thousand immortals entering the mortal realm directly pushed the recovery of the spiritual energy to its peak.” Lin Jiufeng’s eyes were sharp as he discovered some clues.
 It had only been a hundred years since the recovery of spiritual energy started.
 According to the usual pattern, the recovery of spiritual energy at this time should have only reached one-third of its peak. It was far from being this powerful.
 But this era was different from the previous eras.
 In the previous eras, there were neither Myriad Races nor immortals descending into this world.
 Most importantly, no one like Lin Jiufeng came out to stabilize the situation.
 There were geniuses and heaven-defying freaks in every era, but there wouldn’t be a Yuhua God Dynasty in every era. There wouldn’t be common people receiving comprehensive education, nor would there be martial temples of all sizes built throughout the world.
 The rise of a freak-like genius could only affect the few people around him, it couldn’t affect the world.
 However, Lin Jiufeng’s rise was different.
 He had always supported the Yuhua God Dynasty to eliminate difficulties, resist dangers, and protect the people.
 Under the efforts of several generations of emperors, the Yuhua God Dynasty also became more prosperous by the day, constantly reforming its own problems.
 Lin Jiufeng dared to say that the reforms of the Yuhua God Dynasty were unprecedented.
 Especially the Martial Temple. This was established by Emperor De. Ever since Emperor De ascended to the throne, he had been constantly investing in the Martial Temple hugely, spreading the Martial Temple to every corner of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 In the big cities, there were large Martial Temples with thousands of disciples.
 In the remote mountain areas, there would also be a Martial Temple built within the region. The only difference was its size.
 These Martial Temples weren’t under the jurisdiction of the officials. The Martial Temples in the world directly accepted the jurisdiction of the biggest Martial Temple, which was the one built outside the imperial capital.
 Each Martial Temple had two assessments a year. Once the students passed the assessment, they would be able to enter a higher-level Martial Temple.
 The mobility of talents broke the established class system that had existed since ancient times. It allowed the common people at the bottom to see hope and actively send their children to the Martial Temple to learn.
 It wasn’t just the boys. The girls also changed their status of being locked at home.
 Especially under the unbridled publicity of Princess Yulin of the Yuhua God Dynasty, there was a significant increase in the status of women, which was unprecedented.
 These continuous reforms and the Martial Temples that spread throughout the world intensified the recovery of spiritual energy.
 This was also why Lin Jiufeng had always said that as long as Emperor De persevered, his historical status and his influence on the reform of this world would definitely surpass Emperor Yuan’s.
 Emperor Yuan was the pioneer of reforming the decaying Yuhua God Dynasty. He was the first emperor to face the huge pressure of the reforms.
 There was no need to go into detail about his achievements in the world.
 Emperor Ming succeeded the dynasty and did a good job, but he couldn’t surpass Emperor Yuan. He also made mistakes subsequently. Although he corrected them in time, he died young.
 The great cause wasn’t completed, and the reforms were still continuing. Emperor De stood forward at such a time.
 His reform path continued the path of Emperor Yuan and Emperor Ming. Logically speaking, he shouldn’t be able to surpass them either.
 But once the Martial Temple appeared, it was an unprecedented reform.
 Especially when Emperor De insisted on making the Martial Temples completely free and teaching the children even during the most difficult times of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 This achievement was also one of the reasons why the recovery of spiritual energy had reached its peak.
 The geniuses of the Yuhua God Dynasty were simply uncountable.
 Every day, many people broke through to the False Immortal Realm. Every day, there were people coming close to the Immortal Realm. Every day, countless young children entered the Martial Temple, looking forward to becoming immortals as soon as possible and contributing to the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 This was a virtuous cycle. This was also the wealth of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Lin Jiufeng wasn’t afraid at all when he released the thousand immortals in the Celestial Realm.
 Because as the recovery of the spiritual energy reached its peak, in less than a week, the number of immortals belonging to the Yuhua God Dynasty would definitely surpass them.
 This was the confidence of a broad era.
 As the recovery had reached its peak, part of the spiritual energy transformed into immortal energy. The world was huge, and countless people felt that the shackles above their heads had been broken.
 The true Immortal Realm wasn’t far from them. All of them were excited and worked hard towards their goal.
 In Lin Jiufeng’s range of perception, hundreds of people broke through to the Immortal Realm at this moment.
 The portion of immortal energy in the spiritual energy of the world became active and constantly increased.
 Lin Jiufeng smiled. “Not bad. The more powerhouses there are, the more useful they will be to this era. In the future, I won’t have to take charge of the Yuhua God Dynasty anymore. Everyone can be of use.”
 He stopped paying attention to these things. As soon as he walked into the imperial capital, he immediately sensed Zuo Muyun and Zhou Qing.
 Lin Jiufeng wasn’t surprised that Zhou Qing was also here.
 Zhou Qing and Zuo Muyun became neighbors. They lived in the imperial capital and observed this familiar yet also unfamiliar world.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t disturb them. As long as they didn’t cause trouble, the Yuhua God Dynasty welcomed anyone. Everyone could come to the Yuhua God Dynasty and settle down there.
 The world was prosperous, all races lived together, and the Dao of the Human Race was at its peak.
 This was the goal that the Yuhua God Dynasty was working hard to achieve.
 It was also Emperor De’s slogan.
 Lin Jiufeng returned to the Cold Palace. Pushing open the door of the Cold Palace, he immediately saw a beautiful flower of this mortal realm.
 Bai Mao’er!
 She was wearing a water sleeve dress with light blue patterns, making her look pure and flawless.
 The little white cat was reading with her head lowered. Her hanging temples made her look more like a married woman.
 Sitting there, she was like the most beautiful flower in the world, graceful and flawless.
 The sound of the door opening startled her. She raised her head, and a trace of surprise flashed in her beautiful eyes. She quickly put down the book, ran to Lin Jiufeng, and threw herself into his arms.
 “You’re finally back,” Bai Mao’er said sweetly.
 Lin Jiufeng hugged her and smiled gently. “Don’t worry, I’m invincible. No one can hurt me.”
 Bai Mao’er clung to Lin Jiufeng’s body, refusing to let go.
 These days, she missed Lin Jiufeng all the time.
 She was worried that something would happen to Lin Jiufeng, but she also felt that there wouldn’t be a problem. She felt conflicted.
 In the end, she forced herself to read and immersed herself in it, reducing her longing for Lin Jiufeng.
 Seeing her like this, Lin Jiufeng reached out and gave her a princess hug, letting her jade arms wrap around his neck. Then, he strode into the room.
 “I miss you too,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 Boom!
 The door closed.
 Bai Mao’er’s charming voice sounded, causing one’s heart to waver for a long time.
 …
 Lin Jiufeng came back to accompany Bai Mao’er for a night to relieve her worry.
 The next morning, Lin Jiufeng ate the breakfast that she prepared.
 Bai Mao’er was like a flower that had been watered, blooming beautifully.
 She sat down close to Lin Jiufeng and asked softly, “Has the Celestial Realm been destroyed?”
 It was too intense last night, she forgot to ask and only remembered now.
 “It’s destroyed. I’ve already brought back the source energies of the Celestial Realm. They are all in this small cauldron.” Lin Jiufeng took out the cauldron and placed it on the table.
 It was one of the Nine Cauldrons. Although it had become smaller, the weight of history on it didn’t decrease at all.
 Bai Mao’er looked at it solemnly and said hesitantly, “This cauldron… I seem to have… seen it in my bloodline.”
 Lin Jiufeng looked at her beautiful face and asked curiously, “Have you really seen it before?”
 Bai Mao’er nodded and replied affirmatively, “Other cauldrons don’t have this aura. Those who have seen it will definitely have a photographic memory. I’m sure that I’ve seen it before. It was at the moment I transformed.”
 “I’ve seen your bloodline too. There’s no image of the Nine Cauldrons in it,” Lin Jiufeng said hesitantly.
 “No… Not there. It’s deep in the bloodline, in the sea of blood.” Bai Mao’er shook her head.
 Lin Jiufeng became serious. He had seen the depths of Bai Mao’er’s bloodline and saw the sea of blood, but he didn’t enter the sea of blood, so he didn’t see what Bai Mao’er said.
 “But the cauldron I saw was broken.” Bai Mao’er added.
 “Broken?” Lin Jiufeng’s expression changed slightly.
 He knew that the Nine Cauldrons were forged a long time ago. Later on, due to the battles, they disappeared. He didn’t know if they were still intact.
 The cauldron that he signed in to was unscathed.
 But that didn’t mean that the other eight cauldrons were still intact.
 “How many cauldrons did you see in the sea of blood?” Lin Jiufeng asked solemnly.
 “One, and it was broken, but I can still feel the heavy feeling on it. It’s lying quietly under the sea of blood,” Bai Mao’er said quietly.
 “It was shattered and lying quietly under the sea of blood…” Lin Jiufeng’s heart trembled for some reason. He didn’t know why, but he looked at the unscathed cauldron in front of him, and his heart fluctuated a little.
 “Don’t worry. As I break through and become stronger, I will definitely be able to find the source of my bloodline.” Bai Mao’er grabbed Lin Jiufeng’s hand and comforted him.
 “I’ve always had a feeling that the scenes that I’ve seen in my bloodline really exist in a certain place, so we have a chance to investigate it thoroughly.” She added.
 “Then, you have to work hard to become stronger.” Lin Jiufeng smiled gently at her.
 Bai Mao’er smiled and said, “I will work hard. I must catch up to your pace. I won’t be far behind you.”
 Lin Jiufeng reached out and pulled Bai Mao’er into his embrace. He said, “When the world is stable and under the witness and blessings of countless people, I will marry you and make you my wife.”
 Bai Mao’er leaned on Lin Jiufeng’s chest and listened to his surging heartbeat. For some reason, she felt peaceful.
 “Then what are you going to do next?” Bai Mao’er asked Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the cauldron and said, “I need to release these source energies stored here and restore this world to its peak like 20,000 years ago. From then on, the spiritual energy tide won’t repeat and will always be at its peak.”
 “How are you going to release it?” Bai Mao’er asked curiously.
 “Nothing troublesome. Most of the land in the world now belongs to the Yuhua God Dynasty. I just need to bury the cauldron under the imperial capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty and then let the source energies and the destiny of the dynasty stack together. This way, the geniuses of the Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely advance by leaps and bounds and write a glorious piece in this era,” Lin Jiufeng said longingly.
 In fact, he could have chosen to devour the world’s source energies himself. Then, he would definitely be able to cross the Nine Restrictions of the Immortal Realm and advance to the next unfathomable realm.
 But Lin Jiufeng didn’t do so. He chose to return the world’s source energy to this world and the future young people.
 If an era wanted to be glorious, it required the stars to be resplendent and dazzling throughout the world. Just the glory of a single person wasn’t enough.
 Moreover, Lin Jiufeng couldn’t support a God Dynasty by himself forever.
 Therefore, by letting the world’s source energy return to its rightful place, many geniuses would appear and accompany the Yuhua God Dynasty in reforming this world.
 Under the little white cat’s gaze, Lin Jiufeng buried the cauldron in the soil of the Cold Palace.
 Then, a line of words appeared before Lin Jiufeng’s eyes.
 [Released the world’s source energy. Do you want to Sign in?]
 Lin Jiufeng nodded.
 [Sign-In successful. Received a Yuhua Immortal Robe!]
 Lin Jiufeng had signed in before to this. This defensive immortal artifact is quite useful.
 His Yuhua Immortal Robe had been destroyed when he was in the Celestial Realm. It blocked many attacks for him. Now that he had signed in for another one, Lin Jiufeng was naturally very happy.
 But he didn’t keep this Yuhua Immortal Robe for himself. Instead, he gave it to Bai Mao’er.
 The current Lin Jiufeng no longer needed the Yuhua Immortal Robe. His defense was already powerful enough.
 For example, the title of [Real Man] was more useful to him than the Yuhua Immortal Robe. There was nothing more powerful than this title.
 Hence, Lin Jiufeng took out the Yuhua Immortal Robe and handed it to Bai Mao’er. He said, “This is an immortal artifact called the Yuhua Immortal Robe. Wear it on you and you can transform it as you please. It’s quite a good item.”
 “Don’t you need it?” Bai Mao’er asked.
 “I don’t need it. This won’t be of much help to me.” Lin Jiufeng shook his head.
 Seeing this, Bai Mao’er didn’t refuse. She took the Yuhua Immortal Robe and changed into it.
 “Do you still have anything to do next?” Bai Mao’er asked Lin Jiufeng.
 “Next, I want to investigate the matter between the Immortal Court and the God Race back then.” Lin Jiufeng thought for a while and said.
 He and Bai Mao’er had long shared everything between them. Other than the secret of signing in, she knew everything about Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng also knew everything about her.
 “Where are you going to start investigating from? It’s been 20,000 years, there’s no information about it at all now.” Bai Mao’er asked in puzzlement.
 “There’s a place I can start from. A thousand immortals came out of the Celestial Realm this time. They have all lived in the Celestial Realm for more than 10,000 years, so they definitely know a lot of secrets. I’ll go and ask around, I will be able to gain a lot of information from them,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “No wonder I felt a violent fluctuation in the world’s spiritual energy the day before yesterday. So it’s because a thousand immortals appeared.” Bai Mao’er was enlightened.
 The spiritual energy in the world fluctuated previously. She was an immortal, so she definitely sensed it immediately.
 “Their appearance has accelerated the recovery of the world’s spiritual energy. The recovery of the world’s spiritual energy has already reached a peak. With the return of the world’s source energy, the appearance of this world will change drastically,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “For the Yuhua God Dynasty, this is also a chance and a challenge. I won’t interfere, but because these immortals are afraid of me, the safety of the Yuhua God Dynasty won’t be a problem.” Lin Jiufeng added.
 “I sensed it. Just today, hundreds of people from the Yuhua God Dynasty have already become immortals. Every day from now on, there will be people reaching the Immortal Realm. Those 1,000 immortals are still too weak to stir up a storm.” Bai Mao’er was very confident in the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 So was Lin Jiufeng.

                    



 Chapter 304: The Story of the Immortal Court and the God Race  It was very quiet in the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The increase of 1,000 immortals really had no effect on the Yuhua God Dynasty at all. It didn’t cause any waves.
 Especially when there were people breaking through from the False Immortal Realm every moment and becoming a true immortal.
 To the Yuhua God Dynasty, it could truly suppress the world now. Not only was there Lin Jiufeng, but there was also a large group of geniuses.
 The speed at which these geniuses broke through to the Immortal Realm was far beyond what the Myriad Races could compare to.
 In the Myriad Races, a few people would break through to the Immortal Realm every day. On the better days, there would be around ten people who broke through to the Immortal Realm.
 But how could this compare to the hundreds of people in the Yuhua God Dynasty who broke through to the Immortal Realm every day?
 Moreover, this was just the beginning.
 Only when the Martial Temples fully exerted their strength and the young people of the entire country started working hard would the potential of the Yuhua God Dynasty be completely exploited.
 Back then, Emperor De withstood the objections and established the Martial Temple. He truly achieved a long-term strategy.
 Grooming talents was a long-term project.
 Education is the number one policy for a nation to become strong.
 On this foundation, Emperor De surpassed the contributions of any previous emperor.
 He would be known as one of the wisest emperors throughout history!
 The people of the Yuhua God Dynasty also called the recent three emperors the Three Emperors of Revival.
 The three emperors started with Emperor Yuan and reached the peak with Emperor De. Now, the Yuhua God Dynasty had a terrifying powerhouse like Lin Jiufeng to suppress the world. There were also the Martial Temples, constantly producing countless powerhouses.
 The people of the world were improving by the day!
 Because the immortals groomed by the Martial Temples supported Emperor De, Emperor De’s reforms were still continuing. The reforms went deep into every corner of the society and considered the benefits of the common people. All those things that were harmful to the common people were reformed. The imperial court managed the Yuhua God Dynasty in an orderly manner.
 As for the emancipation of the women of the Yuhua God Dynasty, it also started with Princess Yulin breaking through to the Immortal Realm and becoming the first female immortal of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Then, the number of female immortals who broke through to the Immortal Realm began to increase. Although they weren’t as many as men, there were still a certain number of them. At the very least, they were working towards the independence of women.
 This was a good start.
 The immortals who came from the Martial Temple were very respectful to Emperor De, who had a low cultivation base.
 Every student of the Martial Temple had received Emperor De’s great grace. Moreover, when receiving education, patriotic education was one of the compulsory subjects.
 Every immortal had a good understanding of the state of affairs of the dynasty. They knew that the reforms that Emperor De had implemented over the years were all about people and benevolence.
 Hence, although they had broken through to the Immortal Realm, when these people saw Emperor De, they would willingly bow and have an audience with him in the manner of officials, giving Emperor De, the Emperor who worked hard for the dynasty, their own respect.
 How could such a divine dynasty not last long? How could it not be glorious?
 The Myriad Races really extinguished their thoughts of competing for glory with the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 How were they supposed to compete?
 The number of immortals in the Myriad Races both on the surface and in secret only numbered a few thousand when added up.
 But the Yuhua God Dynasty caught up to this number in just ten days, and it was still increasing.
 Could they win against the Yuhua God Dynasty?
 The population base was huge. Once they completely displayed the advantage of the population, the terrifying energy that would erupt from them was something that no one could match.
 Therefore, the Myriad Races extinguished their thoughts of competing for glory and began to learn the methods of the Kunlun Mountains. They merged with the Yuhua God Dynasty and took the initiative to join the Yuhua God Dynasty before the Yuhua God Dynasty completely rose up in power. They became a member of the Yuhua God Dynasty and enjoyed the advantage of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Race after race began to surrender and came to see Emperor De, taking the initiative to join the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 The great integration of the Myriad Races began to become complete in this era.
 Emperor De welcomed them.
 After they joined the Yuhua God Dynasty’s side, Emperor De didn’t ask them to pay much of a price. He only asked them to reform their cultures. The children of the younger generation were to enroll in the Martial Temple to learn the knowledge of the Martial Temple. As the students of the Yuhua God Dynasty, they were to receive a patriotic education and the ideals of treating the common people well.
 When these races joined in, they also had to completely follow the management system of the Yuhua God Dynasty, freeing the slaves, assisting the poor, improving the roads, and improving the facilities…
 They fully sided with the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 From culture to custom, from the higher-ups to the common people.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty would lead the reforms, abandon the old shackles, embrace the new culture, learn the words of the Yuhua God Dynasty, and learn the thoughts of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Emperor De didn’t have any hope of changing those who had already formed a complete worldview, but he wanted to influence the children of the next generation of the Myriad Races. Those teenage children and newborn babies were Emperor De’s goal.
 The education of these children had to start from a young age.
 Generations of people would grow up and then age.
 There would always be people growing and also people aging.
 Emperor De only needed to catch the young people of every generation and nurture them, instilling in them the ideals that they were all the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 In less than two generations, the Myriad Races would completely integrate into the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 From the fundamental, he would destroy the possibility of the Myriad Races rebelling.
 There were also wise people among the Myriad Races who saw through this scheme, but facing the glorious situation of the Yuhua God Dynasty, they were very powerless in their hearts.
 The Yuhua God Dynasty didn’t even need to use Lin Jiufeng and it was already enough to make the Myriad Races fear it.
 As for the immortals who came from the Celestial Realm, they thought that they were top existences in this world.
 Although they were unable to act fearlessly due to the restrictions of Great Emperor Jiufeng, as long as they didn’t provoke the Yuhua God Dynasty, it was still very comfortable.
 Moreover, even if they had provoked some humans, the Yuhua God Dynasty was so big, how could Great Emperor Jiufeng know everything that happened?
 But who would have thought such a situation would happen?
 After they descended to the mortal realm, the world was overturned. Immortals emerged endlessly, and incomparably powerful strength erupted from them.
 They suddenly discovered that after spending more than 10,000 years in the Celestial Realm, the mortal realm had become unfamiliar to them.
 At the very least, it wasn’t the mortal realm that they thought it was.
 When these factors were stacked together, they created the incomparable ruling power of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 …
 Compared to the disturbances of the outside world where the world had completely entered the era of immortals, the Cold Palace was relatively very quiet.
 Lin Jiufeng and Bai Mao’er lived here quietly just by themselves.
 After accompanying Bai Mao’er for a few days to ease her longing for him, Lin Jiufeng went to look for Zuo Muyun.
 Zuo Muyun lived in seclusion in the imperial capital.
 Compared to the newly broken through immortals who were high-spirited, prosperous, and in the limelight, Zuo Muyun was much more low-key.
 He enjoyed living an ordinary and quiet life as a nameless person.
 Especially with the addition of a neighbor, Zhou Qing!
 The two of them gathered together when they had nothing to do and chatted about their respective pasts. In the three months in the immortal realms, they became companions and good friends. Their personalities and their experiences were very similar.
 Zuo Muyun had once made a mistake. He betrayed the Human Race and joined the ranks of the God of Darkness.
 Zhou Qing also made mistakes and became the lackey of the Immortal Court’s descendants, serving them for more than 10,000 years.
 Now, they had realized the error of their ways and were tired of their former lives. They had experienced the trials and tribulations of the world, and their mentalities were completely different from that of young immortals. They chose to live in seclusion peacefully.
 Lin Jiufeng came to look for Zuo Muyun. He found him in his courtyard, cooking a delicious meal and preparing to eat with Zhou Qing.
 Knock knock knock!
 Lin Jiufeng arrived and knocked on the door.
 Seeing that it was Lin Jiufeng, Zuo Muyun opened the door to the courtyard in surprise. He said happily, “Great Emperor Jiufeng, your presence truly graces my humble house.”
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, shall we have a drink together?” Zhou Qing invited Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng nodded in agreement. “Sure, it just so happens that I have something to ask you guys too. I’ll ask as I drink.”
 “As long as it’s something that I know, I will definitely tell you everything.” Zhou Qing patted his chest and agreed.
 Zuo Muyun took out the wine and said proudly, “These are all good wines that have been around for 10,000 years. I personally buried them back then. It’s been 10,000 years, they are peerless-grade wine now.”
 “You can still find wine that’s 10,000 years old?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 Zuo Muyun smiled helplessly. “I found the wine from 10,000 years ago, but I couldn’t find my family and friends from 10,000 years ago. There was no trace of them at all. They disappeared in the long river of history.”
 “It’s been more than 10,000 years. Too many things have been buried in history. Back then, my family members also passed away one after another. I had nothing holding me back in the mortal realm, that’s why I joined the Celestial Realm.” Zhou Qing laughed at himself.
 “Then let’s toast to the people who have existed in the past but disappeared. Although they have disappeared, they will never disappear in our hearts. They will definitely continue to exist in the future.” Lin Jiufeng raised the wine cup. The wine in the cup was crystal clear and light blue. After experiencing the baptism of time, its taste became increasingly delicious.
 The three of them raised their cups and drank the wine in one gulp.
 After three rounds of drinks, Zhou Qing asked Lin Jiufeng, “Great Emperor Jiufeng, what do you want to ask me?”
 Lin Jiufeng looked at Zhou Qing and said, “I want to know about the true Immortal Court and the God Race. Tell me whatever you know.”
 “The true Immortal Court and the God Race…” Zhou Qing smacked his lips and fell into his memories.
 “Actually, speaking of which, in the Celestial Realm, there are very few people who know the true grudges between the Immortal Court and the God Race, including that group of remnants. Most of them were born at the end of the era of the Immortal Court. When they were slightly more mature, the war between the Immortal Court and the God Race had already ended.”
 “At that time, the true powerhouses of the Immortal Court had already been wiped out. The God Race were fully killed too. According to this situation, the Immortal Court could have continued to recover. After waiting for a few thousand years, it could have suppressed the world again.”
 “But at that time, an old man came to the Immortal Court. He suppressed the Immortal Court with his lone strength and wiped out the last of the Immortal Court’s powerhouses. He even shattered the Immortal Court. It was at that time that those descendants saw that the Immortal Court could no longer be saved. They stole the world’s source energy and escaped. They built the Celestial Realm and then recruited me.”
 Zhou Qing shared everything he knew. He explained it clearly.
 Lin Jiufeng and Zuo Muyun listened attentively.
 “The old man who destroyed the Immortal Court is called Elder Universe, right?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 Zhou Qing nodded. “I also heard it from the remnants of the Immortal Court. They have a deep taboo against this name, so when you mentioned Elder Universe previously, my reaction was very big. It’s because they told me these things.”
 Lin Jiufeng nodded. He knew that Elder Universe had destroyed the Immortal Court.
 But later on, he learned that the main destruction of the Immortal Court was in the hands of the God Race. At that time, he was puzzled as to why Elder Universe had said that he destroyed the Immortal Court.
 Now that he heard Zhou Qing’s explanation, it turned out that after the war between the God Race and the Immortal Court, the God Race had yet to completely destroy the Immortal Court. Some of the powerhouses of the Immortal Court remained.
 This also proved that the Immortal Court back then was really powerful. The God Race did their best, but they weren’t able to completely eliminate the Imperial Court.
 If it wasn’t for Elder Universe delaying the recovery of the Immortal Court by a few thousand years, then the Myriad Races wouldn’t have been able to develop.
 Hence, it was also possible for Elder Universe to say that he could crush the Immortal Court.
 “Then, how much do you know about the Immortal Court and the God Race?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “I did read some records about the God Race in the books in the Celestial Realm. The God Race is a very huge race. They have two major factions, light and darkness. They are like the front and the back of a world, or maybe they are Yin and Yang. Light and darkness don’t deal with each other, but for the sake of the Immortal Court, they actually joined forces to resist the Immortal Court together,” Zhou Qing said.
 “Light and darkness!” Lin Jiufeng drank a mouthful of wine.
 “Yes, I know that too. For example, the previous God of Darkness. He was originally the God of Light, but after the Immortal Court was destroyed, for some reason, he gathered a lot of dark energy and ultimately transformed into the God of Darkness. After he fell into depravity, his strength became stronger,” Zuo Muyun chimed in.
 “I know that. I killed him with my own hands. He’s indeed very dark.” Lin Jiufeng nodded.
 “How many powerhouses are there in the Immortal Court?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “It’s recorded in the Immortal Court that there was a Lord of the Immortal Court, four Great Emperors, and 38 Combat Generals. These were all top powerhouses, and there were also countless powerhouses below them. At that time, the Immortal Court was really high and mighty. This was also the reason why the group of remnants of the Immortal Court was so lofty and proud,” Zhou Qing said.
 “But it has already been destroyed now,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 The remnants of the Immortal Court were too weak, but they were still acting high and mighty. They couldn’t even defeat him, so how could they recover the Immortal Court?
 If the Immortal Court relied on them to recover, that would really be the greatest joke in the world.
 “Why did the Immortal Court and the God Race have a conflict that caused the light gods and dark gods to actually join forces to resist?” Lin Jiufeng asked, puzzled.
 This was something he didn’t understand.
 “Competing for territory? Or competing for control of the world?” Zhou Qing guessed. He shook his head, not knowing.
 “I didn’t find any answers in the books in the Celestial Realm. When I asked the remnants of the Celestial Realm, they didn’t tell me. I felt that they didn’t know either. This is a secret that only the higher-ups of the Immortal Court know.” Zhou Qing added.
 “Some of the old and young descendants of the Immortal Court survived, then didn’t anyone from the God Race survive too?” Lin Jiufeng asked, puzzled.
 “Didn’t the God of Darkness survive?” Zuo Muyun asked with a smile.
 “He doesn’t count.” Lin Jiufeng shook his head.
 When the God of Darkness was in power, that was during the era of the Myriad Races. Moreover, he had clearly betrayed the God Race.
 The key was that he was probably still young when the God Race was fighting with the Immortal Court, just like the remnants of the Immortal Court.
 “The remnants have also discussed this problem,” Zhou Qing said.
 “What’s the outcome of the discussion?” Lin Jiufeng looked at Zhou Qing curiously.
 Zuo Muyun was also very curious.
 “The outcome of the discussion is that the group of people from the God Race back then has completely disappeared with the counterattack of the Immortal Court. But the bloodline of the God Race should have been passed down, it’s just that we don’t know where it is,” Zhou Qing said.
 “The bloodline from the God Race has been passed down?” Lin Jiufeng’s eyes lit up.
 It was good if the bloodline of the God Race had been passed down. If this bloodline still existed, he would be able to find it and continue investigating the sealed history of the past.  [Listen to the past of the Immortal Court and the God Race. Do you want to Sign in?]
 A line of words suddenly appeared in front of Lin Jiufeng’s eyes. He was stunned.
 He could even sign in to this?
 It seemed that this piece of history really had a lot of significance.

                    



 Chapter 305: Inviting God  
 [Sign-In successful. Received a map of the God Race Village!]
 These words appeared before Lin Jiufeng’s eyes.
 His expression changed and he was surprised. Just now, he was still talking about whether there were any descendants of the God Race being passed down. Now, he signed in for this map. Even the heavens were helping him.
 In a good mood, Lin Jiufeng picked up his wine cup and drank it in one gulp. Then, he continued to chat with Zhou Qing and Zuo Muyun.
 After three rounds of drinking, the effect of the 10,000-year-old wine was quite strong. They didn’t resist the wine effect forcefully. Therefore, the faces of the three people turned slightly red. Their mood was quite high at his moment.
 Zuo Muyun looked at Lin Jiufeng and gave him a thumbs up. “It’s really the blessing of this era for a person like Great Emperor Jiufeng to exist in this era.”
 Zhou Qing nodded and agreed. “That’s right. In the previous eras of spiritual energy recovery, I came down to ferry immortals into the Celestial Realm and witnessed the tragic state of the era of spiritual energy recovery. It’s completely incomparable to the current prosperity.”
 Lin Jiufeng waved his hand. “This era wasn’t created by me alone. It was built by the millions of officials and common people of the Yuhua God Dynasty.”
 “There’s no need to be humble. We can still see this clearly. Without Great Emperor Jiufeng, there wouldn’t be the Yuhua God Dynasty.” Zhou Qing shook his head. He took a sip of wine, his eyes dazed as if he was looking back at the previous eras.
 “I clearly remember that 5,000 years ago, when I came out to recruit the immortals and stood on the Immortal Road to look at the mortal world, it was really a purgatory. Cultivators ran amok. A single battle could destroy hundreds of thousands of common people and bring disaster to the people. In an era of spiritual energy recovery, large numbers of ordinary people died. Whether it was intentional or not, even if they were hundreds of miles away, the aftershocks of a battle could sweep the common people away. What’s more, the common people had no one to complain to or ask for support,” Zhou Qiong said.
 Lin Jiufeng and Zuo Muyun were speechless.
 “This is what I respect the most about Great Emperor Jiufeng. To the common people, the national policy that the Yuhua God Dynasty has set up is simply a paradise in the mortal world. It’s harmonious and beautiful. In such a magnificent era, the Yuhua God Dynasty not only protected the common people but also gave the common people hope. It nurtured so many immortals and practically gave all of the people a chance to cultivate. Through the river of time, this is a type of broad-mindedness that only Great Emperor Jiufeng has!!” Zuo Muyun toasted Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng drank it all in one gulp. He smiled slightly and said, “You guys are praising me so much that I’m embarrassed. I’ve always insisted on a dream, and that is that everyone will become talented. Everyone has a chance to become talented. In such a good era, the world of the living shouldn’t become a purgatory. The world of the living should be filled with benign competition. Even the common people at the bottom of society have a chance of becoming immortals. Although talent is needed, the Yuhua God Dynasty is nurturing them for free, allowing the bottom-level people, who have been ignored by countless people in the past, to truly erupt with a huge amount of energy.”
 Zhou Qing and Zuo Muyun listened attentively. It was obvious that they were very interested in Lin Jiufeng’s words.
 Because since ancient times, there had never been a dynasty that did this.
 This was very new and attractive to them.
 “The might of an individual’s strength is an individual’s matter. But for a nation and a dynasty to be powerful, they need to be powerful from top to bottom.”
 “What is the most common thing in this era?”
 “Cultivators? Myriad Races? Cultivation techniques? Or aristocratic families?”
 “The most common thing is humans!”
 “Common and extremely ordinary humans.”
 “They are farmers who have lived their entire lives in the yellow soil and facing the sky. They are the common people at the bottom who have lived a very bitter life and can’t see hope. There are hundreds of millions of them, but they have never been taken seriously. They are treated as leeks and reaped back and forth.”
 “If the Yuhua God Dynasty continues to learn from its predecessors, it will be seeking death. The Yuhua God Dynasty needs to be reformed, so from Emperor Yuan onwards, I have been silently supporting from behind the scenes.”
 “I believe that the future of the Yuhua God Dynasty will definitely be in the hands of these people. This is because their base numbers are huge. Once their wisdom is developed and has channels to improve, the mortal world will also surpass the so-called Immortal Court and the so-called Celestial Realm.”
 “The mortal realm will be equal to paradise!”
 Lin Jiufeng said firmly.
 His ideals, Emperor De’s ideals, and the Yuhua God Dynasty’s ideals.
 It was all written into the new laws of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Zhou Qing and Zuo Muyun’s blood boiled as they listened. They had no doubt that these words were true.
 Because this was what the Yuhua God Dynasty had always been doing and was doing it beautifully.
 They weren’t people with vision disorder, nor were they people with incomplete intelligence.
 With their own judgment, they could see how the lives of the ordinary people were and the channels for them to improve in this era.
 Currently, hundreds of people in the Yuhua God Dynasty were breaking through to the Immortal Realm every day. Many of them were the children of the common people who were once at the bottom.
 If it weren’t for the Yuhua God Dynasty and Lin Jiufeng, they would still be at the bottom of the food chain now. They would continue to live the lives of their ancestors and live tough lives. One day, they might accidentally pass away.
 “You two, you are currently living in seclusion in the Yuhua God Dynasty. Do I have the honor to invite you two to join the Yuhua God Dynasty and contribute to the Human Race and the most difficult dream of this world?” Seeing that the two were excited, Lin Jiufeng decisively sent out an invitation.
 Inviting them to join the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 Zuo Muyun and Zhou Qing weren’t ordinary immortals. They had cultivated in the Immortal Realm for a long time. Although they hadn’t broken through the threshold to the next realm, it would be simple for them to break through soon in the current era.
 If they joined the Yuhua God Dynasty, the strength of the Yuhua God Dynasty would rise to another level.
 Zhou Qing and Zuo Muyun looked at each other. Hearing Lin Jiufeng’s invitation, the two of them smiled at each other. Then, they raised their wine cups and said, “We accept.”
 Lin Jiufeng laughed out loud. He was in a good mood. He raised his wine cup and clinked it with theirs, then drank it all in one gulp.
 “You two can go and look for Emperor De tomorrow. Tell him that I recommended you to go there and arranged for you two to go to the Martial Temple to manage it. There are more and more immortals now, and the management of the Martial Temple also needs to keep up with the times. You guys are just in time to nurture the countless people at the bottom and let their children become dragons and phoenixes.” Lin Jiufeng got up, arranged their duties for them, and then turned to leave.
 Lin Jiufeng already knew what he wanted to know. In addition, he also received a map. To Lin Jiufeng, he had enjoyed his meal. He didn’t plan to continue disturbing Zhou Qing and Zuo Muyun.
 The key was that he had finished drinking the good wine and therefore left chicly.
 Zhou Qing and Zuo Muyun looked at each other.
 “I’ve never been a teacher before, but I’m looking forward to it.” Zhou Qing chuckled.
 “I’ve been living in a muddled state for half my life, and I’ve never had a clear goal all this time. But now, I’ve found a new direction. Like a ship that has lost its way on the sea, I’ve found a sea route. In the future, I will work hard for the Martial Temple,” Zuo Muyun said firmly.
 He had previously fallen into darkness and given up his identity as a human. He had always regretted it. Now that Lin Jiufeng gave him this chance, he must make a contribution to the Human Race.
 …
 Lin Jiufeng left Zuo Muyun’s courtyard. He wasn’t in a hurry to return to the Cold Palace. Instead, he opened the map that he had received from signing in.
 This was a map of the God Race Village.
 For Lin Jiufeng, it was very important to go to this village and obtain information about the God Race.
 The map was made of an unknown material and was well-preserved. Some of the routes on it were clearly marked.
 But there was one thing. The roads and locations on this map were not from this era.
 Lin Jiufeng frowned as he looked at it. “With the changes of the era, the names of the various places are constantly changing. The names on the maps from more than 10,000 years ago or even 20,000 years ago weren’t passed down. This is a problem.”
 He had a map and a name, but he just couldn’t find it.
 Because the map was different from the current era.
 Moreover, in the past 20,000 years, many roads had long disappeared in the long river of history.
 This was also a problem.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the map carefully, speechless.
 “I need to find someone to help me read this map.” Lin Jiufeng thought carefully. Who could help him decipher this map?
 After thinking for a while, a person appeared in Lin Jiufeng’s mind.
 Miss Hong!
 Heavenly Dao Sect’s Miss Hong!
 The Holy Maiden who was deeply entangled with him at the beginning, the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Miss Hong, was also a woman who carried her ideals and persisted to the end.
 It had been many years since Lin Jiufeng last parted ways with her.
 Previously, Lin Jiufeng had met her a few times in the Mountain Sea Realm.
 But after there was no news of her elders, senior brothers, and senior sisters, Miss Hong became disheartened. She brought the people of the Heavenly Dao Sect and began to live in seclusion.
 Then, after the emergence of the Myriad Races, Lin Jiufeng also met her in the Hundred Thousand Mountains.
 That time was the last time she fulfilled the responsibility of being a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 She sealed a very powerful race among the Myriad Races.
 But the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race weren’t on good terms with her. A conflict broke out and she almost went to look for her senior brothers, sisters, and master in the afterlife.
 It was also Lin Jiufeng who saved her at the crucial moment.
 Then, he handed Elder Universe’s secret manual to her. It was the supreme secret manual of the Heavenly Dao Sect. It had been lost, but Lin Jiufeng obtained it and handed it to her.
 Since then, until now, the two of them had never met again.
 He didn’t know where Miss Hong went.
 She should be comprehending the supreme mystic technique of the Heavenly Dao Sect, the Universe Clock.
 This was Elder Universe’s mystic technique. He also used this secret technique to kill his way into the Immortal Court in that era and buried the immortal spirits, gods, and the Immortal Court of the old era!
 Lin Jiufeng personally handed the Universe Clock technique to Miss Hong. Then, the two of them never interacted again.
 “Where exactly is Miss Hong currently at?” Lin Jiufeng murmured.
 He thought about it carefully. He thought about all the places where Miss Hong had appeared previously.
 After a long time, an idea came to Lin Jiufeng’s mind.
 He remembered a place.
 Northwest Territory, Mountain Sea Realm.
 “That place buried Miss Hong’s master, senior brothers, and senior sisters. It buried the absolute main force of the Heavenly Dao Sect in the previous era. They were the people she treasured the most. If I were Miss Hong, I would definitely choose to live in seclusion there,” Lin Jiufeng said firmly.
 He made up his mind. He took a step forward and changed the space around him. At a speed incomprehensible to ordinary people, he rushed to the Northwest Territory, the Mountain Sea Realm.
 In the past, he lived in the depths of the Northwest Territory for a few years and signed in countless treasures. His gains were huge.
 Now that he was here again, what greeted his eyes was a completely different Northwest Territory from before.
 The national policies of the Yuhua God Dynasty had been stable over the years. The Myriad Races no longer stirred up trouble. The common people’s lives had improved. The once deserted Northwest Territory was now filled with people.
 The desert had turned into green lands, and the rolling yellow soil also disappeared.
 All of this displayed the merits of the Yuhua God Dynasty’s governance.
 Lin Jiufeng walked across the Northwest Territory and went deep into the Mountain Sea Realm. He saw that the situation there was still the same as before.
 There were few people here. There was an oasis and a single city here. It was well-preserved.
 Here, it was still a boundless desert. The Yuhua God Dynasty retained this place as its original state, allowing the descendants of the Yuhua God Dynasty to see what a boundless desert was like.
 But the once crowded ancient city was now empty. The entrance was open.
 Lin Jiufeng walked closer and saw a red-robed girl fishing by the lake.
 The door that floated in the center of the lake had already sunk. The small world had integrated into the main world and was no longer an independent world.
 The red-robed girl was very beautiful. Time had never left a mark on her body. Instead, it gave her composure and elegance.
 She was very powerful and was at the Immortal Realm.
 “Long time no see, Great Emperor Jiufeng!” The red-robed girl’s voice was gentle as she turned to look at Lin Jiufeng with a smile.
 Her beautiful eyes turned around and her beautiful hair fluttered in the breeze, passing through Lin Jiufeng’s heart.
 It was like a pool of spring water, slightly wrinkled and rippling.
 Lin Jiufeng’s heart quickly calmed down. He also smiled and said, “Long time no see.”
 It had really been a long time.
 How many decades could a mortal live for?
 “You unlocked the Nine Restrictions?” Lin Jiufeng walked over and asked curiously.
 “Yes, I just entered this realm a few days ago. It’s all thanks to you giving me the mystic technique, the Universe Clock.” Miss Hong smiled sweetly. It seemed that her mood had improved after meeting Lin Jiufeng.
 “I wanted to look for you, but there was no news or traces of you. Over the years, there have been turbulent times in the outside world and countless geniuses have emerged, but there’s no news of that Miss Hong who suppressed the world back then. I have to say, it’s a pity.” Lin Jiufeng stood beside Miss Hong and looked at the familiar lake as he said.
 Miss Hong sat there, her red clothes spread out like a flirtatious blooming flower.
 Lin Jiufeng stood beside her in white, accentuating her beauty and nobility.
 “Everyone has their regrets, but without Miss Hong in this world, there’s still the indomitable Great Emperor Jiufeng. This is enough,” Miss Hong said.
 “How have you been all these years?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “Not bad. When I left the Hundred Thousand Mountains back then, the world was huge, but it made me feel afraid and empty. I could go anywhere I wanted, but at the same time, I had nowhere to go, and no attachment. In the end, I still came here. At the very least, this is the closest place to my master and the others,” Miss Hong said calmly. After the baptism of time, she could also tell this story that she once didn’t dare to face very calmly.
 Her heart would still ache a little. But the feeling of being lost back then no longer existed.
 “Why have you come to look for me this time?” Miss Hong quickly composed herself. She looked up at Lin Jiufeng and asked.
 Lin Jiufeng wasn’t embarrassed. He took out the map and handed it to Miss Hong. He said, “Help me take a look at the location of this map. Where is it today?”
 Miss Hong observed carefully. She frowned and said, “It’s still a little difficult to find the exact location of such a map from ages ago.”
 “If there are no difficulties, I won’t come to look for you,” Lin Jiufeng said with a smile.
 “You really believe that I can handle it?” Miss Hong squinted at Lin Jiufeng.
 “When I encountered this problem, only you appeared in my mind. There was no one else, so I came,” Lin Jiufeng said seriously.
 Miss Hong pursed her lips. Her heart warmed. She lowered her head and seriously recorded the names of each place. Then, she stood up and walked towards the ancient city.
 Lin Jiufeng immediately followed Miss Hong into this ancient city that he was once very familiar with.
 But now, there were very few people in this ancient city. There was only Miss Hong and her disciples.
 Miss Hong lived in seclusion here. She recruited dozens of disciples and then nurtured them carefully to continue the legacy of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 Hence, this ancient city was the foundation of the Heavenly Dao Sect now.
 Miss Hong had already moved all the books of the Heavenly Dao Sect here and settled down here.
 Previously, Lin Jiufeng had already read all the books in the Heavenly Dao Sect’s library, but this time, Miss Hong didn’t use this method.
 “Do you know there’s a mystic technique in the Heavenly Dao Sect called Inviting God?” Miss Hong asked Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng shook his head. “I don’t know. What’s the use of this mystic technique?”
 “This mystic technique can invite my former ancestors to descend and tell me some information,” Miss Hong said.
 “That powerful?” Lin Jiufeng looked at her in surprise.
 “It’s indeed quite powerful, but the restrictions are also huge,” Miss Hong said.
 “This requires you to ask the ancestor you are inviting to be a very powerful existence and to have left his own traces in the long river of history. This way, even if he has already died and disintegrated, there will still be traces of him existing in this world. Only then could the Inviting God mystic technique succeed.”
 “Moreover, once it succeeds, it will also be a huge burden for the one who executed this mystic technique. The body of the person must bear the terrifying pressure of the ancestor, so no one will be willing to try using this mystic technique.”
 “But we’ve known each other for so many years, I’m willing to use this mystic technique for you this once. Treat it as returning a favor.”
 Miss Hong said to Lin Jiufeng with a smile.
 Lin Jiufeng frowned and asked, “Is it very oppressive to your body?”
 Miss Hong tilted her head cutely. She thought for a while and said, “It’s not that big. I’m not weak either. Although I’m not as powerful as you, I can still withstand it.”
 “Moreover, this mystic technique is hidden in the secret manual you gave me. If you didn’t give this mystic technique to me, I won’t be able to use it either. Therefore, doing good deeds causes good results. Congratulations, you have found the right person.” Miss Hong patted her chest and teased Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng smiled and stopped talking. He followed Miss Hong to a hall.
 In the center of this hall, countless memorial tablets were enshrined. They were all past seniors of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 “These are the ancestors of the Heavenly Dao Sect. These are my master, senior brothers, and senior sisters.” Miss Hong introduced.
 Lin Jiufeng bowed seriously and then looked at Miss Hong. “Have you completely let go?”
 The previous Miss Hong didn’t admit that these people had died. She was willing to live in the fake story that she had constructed, she didn’t want to accept this cruel truth.
 But now, she faced it calmly and said, “I’m no longer a young girl. I can’t deceive myself anymore.”
 After all these years, both the young boy and young girl had grown up.
 Miss Hong pointed at the one with the highest-ranking and said, “That’s Elder Universe, the person I’m inviting this time. I will communicate with him. When the time comes, I will ask for the names of these places and tell you the result. Help me keep guard and don’t let anyone disturb me.”
 Lin Jiufeng nodded seriously.
 “Go out now and close the door. I will help you ask for answers.” Miss Hong waved Lin Jiufeng out and stood elegantly in front of the memorial tablet.
 Lin Jiufeng walked out and slowly closed the door.
 The door gradually closed. The sunlight also constantly shrank and locked onto Miss Hong. She looked at Lin Jiufeng with a flower-like smile.
 Boom!
 Until the door was completely closed, it was as if they were in two different worlds.
 Miss Hong looked at the closed door. The luster on her face dimmed. She turned around and looked at the countless rankings. She revealed a happy smile and said softly, “The Inviting God mystic technique that can only be executed once per lifetime. What kind of feeling is it? I’ll give it a try.”

                    



 Chapter 306: The Weak Miss Hong  Inviting God was a special ability for the people of the Heavenly Dao Sect.
 However, they could only use it once in their life.
 The only use was to communicate with the seniors of the Heavenly Dao Sect who had left traces in the long river of history. At a huge price, they would communicate with these peak powerhouses to obtain key information and then use it to improve themselves.
 This was equivalent to paying a certain price in exchange for a chance to break through.
 In the past, the Heavenly Dao Sect had produced many powerhouses. The Inviting God mystic technique was part of the main reason.
 Unfortunately, due to the chaos of war and other reasons, the Inviting God mystic technique had already been lost.
 It was only when Lin Jiufeng gave the mystic technique, the Universe Clock, to Miss Hong that she comprehended the Inviting God mystic technique.
 She could only use this technique once in a lifetime. She could have used it to break through to the next realm, but now, she was willing to use it to solve Lin Jiufeng’s problem.
 In the dark hall, Miss Hong sat down. Her hands were placed on her lower abdomen. Her breathing was calm, and her glabella shone. A wisp of divinity erupted, bringing her soul into a mysterious world.
 Pu!
 In the very next moment, blood flowed from her nose. It was as if all her energy had been sucked out of her body. She instantly became weak and aged ten years.
 This was a very heavy loss for an immortal.
 She had injured her source energy.
 Moreover, this injury would continue as the time needed to execute the technique increased.
 As long as she didn’t stop channeling this technique, this kind of injury wouldn’t stop. Over time, it would cause permanent damage.
 At this moment, Miss Hong didn’t realize that her body was already bearing a huge burden. Her consciousness left her body and came to a magical space.
 It was a boundless wasteland. The sky was crimson, the ground was brown, and there were large ruins in the distance.
 Miss Hong’s spiritual body looked down and was instantly stunned.
 She was actually in the void at this moment.
 In the endless void, there was a world that seemed to have been destroyed.
 On this ruined world sat an old man. His face was aged, his hair was scattered, and his gray hair was mixed with white hair. He looked extremely old.
 Miss Hong walked over and looked at this old man. Suddenly, her hands formed a seal. A special seal that only the people from the Heavenly Dao Sect knew made the old man’s eyes light up.
 “I didn’t expect that a descendant of the Heavenly Dao Sect would come to look for me.” The old man’s voice rang as he laughed.
 “Miss Hong of the Heavenly Dao Sect greets Senior Elder Universe.” Miss Hong bowed.
 “Little girl, you are already at the Nine Restrictions of the Immortal Realm. You came to look for me this time because you want to ask about the method to break through to the next realm, right?” Elder Universe asked.
 “It’s a pity that you came too early.”
 “You shouldn’t have come to look for me to break through from the Nine Restrictions. This threshold isn’t a problem for the people of the Heavenly Dao Sect. You should have come when you want to break through from the Immortal King Realm. That way, your body can still persist for a long time. I can completely unfold the path of the Immortal King for you to comprehend in detail.”
 “You are still too weak. You can’t withstand my realm. You won’t be able to stay for long and can’t learn anything. All you can learn now is just the knowledge of the Nine Restrictions, it’s not worth it.” Elder Universe shook his head and sighed, saying that Miss Hong was too anxious.
 But in the next moment, Miss Hong shook her head and clarified, “I’m not here to ask about these. I’m here to ask Senior some questions for a friend.”
 Elder Universe was stunned. He looked at Miss Hong and asked, puzzled, “You know the price of executing Inviting God, right?”
 “I know.” Miss Hong nodded.
 “Since you know, why did you waste the Inviting God technique that can only be used once in your life on others?” Elder Universe asked, puzzled.
 Miss Hong was silent for a while before saying, “En, I feel that I should help him. He has also helped me a lot.”
 “This person is a male child, right?” Elder Universe chuckled.
 Miss Hong’s face was very calm. She wasn’t shy from Elder Universe’s teasing laughter. She faced it rather calmly. “Yes.”
 “What kind of male child is worthy of you paying such a huge price?” Elder Universe’s gossipy heart perked up.
 “Senior, I don’t have much time. My body won’t be able to withstand for too long.” Miss Hong reminded Elder Universe.
 “It’s fine. I will help you offset some of the pressure. When one is old, one will love to listen to gossip. You are the descendant of the Heavenly Dao Sect, which means you are also my descendant. I have no relatives in my life. The Heavenly Dao Sect nurtured me, and I treat the descendants of the Heavenly Dao Sect as my own children. Now that you have crossed endless time to come and find me, I naturally have to ask. This is probably the last time I get to communicate with the descendants of the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Elder Universe sighed.
 He raised his hand. His skin was dry and thin like chicken claws. There wasn’t much flesh left on him. He gently stroked Miss Hong’s forehead.
 Miss Hong didn’t refuse. She only felt her body relax, and her spiritual body became slightly more complete.
 The vast majority of the pressure was offset by Elder Universe.
 “Are you that powerful?” Miss Hong asked in surprise.
 The Elder Universe in front of her wasn’t a physical body. Moreover, he was different from Miss Hong. Miss Hong was a spiritual body while the Elder Universe here was only a wisp of mark that had been branded in the long river of time in the past countless years.
 But it was this mark that could help her resist so much pressure.
 Elder Universe’s power was really terrifying!
 “Do you see the ruins behind you?” Elder Universe sat on a huge rock and pointed behind him.
 Miss Hong nodded.
 “Do you know where this is?” Elder Universe asked again.
 Miss Hong’s eyes narrowed as she guessed. “It’s the Immortal Court, right?”
 She heard from Lin Jiufeng that in Elder Universe’s final battle, he killed his way into the Immortal Court and buried the immortal spirits of the old era, the gods, and the Immortal Court!
 This should be the Immortal Court.
 “That’s right. The Immortal Court that once ruled the world for tens of thousands of years was personally destroyed by me. The Immortal Court that was infinitely glorious and had extremely terrifying powerhouses and background was shattered by me. There won’t be another Immortal Court in the future.” Elder Universe smiled proudly.
 “You are really powerful.” Miss Hong praised sincerely.
 “Actually, the joy of destroying the Immortal Court isn’t as great as your arrival. I’m very happy to see you at this moment, so tell me, what kind of outstanding person is that male child to be willing to let you give up so much?” Elder Universe continued to gossip. His arrogance and smugness from before disappeared, like a grandfather of an ordinary family who was concerned about the gossip of his granddaughter.
 Miss Hong recalled and said, “He is a great hero, an idealist, and also a practitioner. The ideals of the Heavenly Dao Sect were implemented very thoroughly by him. He did what our Heavenly Dao Sect hasn’t done for tens of thousands of years.”
 “There’s such a person?” Elder Universe didn’t believe it and was very suspicious.
 He knew how ideal the ideals of the Heavenly Dao Sect were. Realizing it was really difficult.
 “The world is peaceful, the people are united, the common people at the bottom live and work in peace. There is no killing. Everyone has a bright future. Someone actually managed to realize such an ideal?” Elder of the Universe felt that Miss Hong was bragging.
 “Yes, it has been realized.” Miss Hong smiled for the first time. It was a happy, beautiful smile. She said it firmly.
 “In the future, the children of the farmers, the children of the merchants, the children of the scholars, and the children of the aristocratic families will all have a bright future. A nation called the Yuhua God Dynasty conquered the world, treated the common people well, and reformed all the bad habits. Countless immortals were born, and no faction dared to behave atrociously in front of the Yuhua God Dynasty. The Myriad Races actively integrated into the Yuhua God Dynasty, and there are new changes in the Yuhua God Dynasty every day.”
 “All of this was brought here by a person called Great Emperor Jiufeng.”
 “He’s the supreme powerhouse of this era.”
 “He saved me many times. I need to repay him.”
 “Moreover, he also actively investigated the Immortal Court and the God Race. He’s a person that I have to look up to.”
 Miss Hong said seriously.
 This was her true feelings for Lin Jiufeng.
 She had been paying close attention to what Lin Jiufeng had done. Even deep in the Northwest Territory, her source of information had never stopped. She was very clear about the latest events.
 “You praised this person too much.” Elder Universe curled his lips.
 Miss Hong said, “He deserves such praise.”
 “Alright, since you praise him so much, what exactly is the matter that he asked you to do?” Elder Universe asked.
 “After the passage of time, we are no longer able to find the original location of this map. Senior, please advise me.” Miss Hong took out the map.
 Elder Universe didn’t take it. Instead, he glanced at it. He raised his brows and asked, “Isn’t this a map of the Third World?”
 Miss Hong looked at Elder Universe in confusion. “?”
 “That was the world of the God Race, but it was subsequently destroyed by the Immortal Court. Then, it became a village, and this map was created. If you really look for it according to this map, it will be very difficult to find. It should have been closed, and the passageway to it from the main world has been sealed.” Elder Universe explained.
 “Then, how do we find the village in this?” Miss Hong asked.
 “Well, I’ll give you a solution. Back then, I even went into this place before. It was a magical place. If that whatever Great Emperor Jiufeng wants to go, you have to go too. You can learn a lot over there. You are too weak now, you have to improve yourself.” Elder Universe reached out and patted Miss Hong’s forehead. A memory was stored in her mind.
 Miss Hong nodded. She understood how to find the village now.
 “You still have a little time. Since you are here, I can’t be stingy. I will teach you some of the Great Dao so that you will take fewer detours on the path of cultivation. Perhaps in the future, you can bear some heavy responsibility!” Elder Universe said solemnly.
 Miss Hong asked curiously, “What do you mean? What will happen in the future?”
 “I don’t know. After I buried the immortal spirits, gods, and the Immortal Court of the old era, I discovered that there are many secrets behind them. I didn’t figure them out, so I didn’t tell you. But the Immortal Court will definitely recover in the future at a certain time,” Elder Universe said affirmatively.
 “Wasn’t the Immortal Court buried by you?” Miss Hong pointed at the distant ruins.
 “That’s only the tangible stuff. I can destroy the tangible ones, but I can’t destroy invisible ones. The tangible ones aren’t terrifying, but the terrifying ones are the invisible Immortal Court. You are the hope of the Heavenly Dao Sect, you have to work hard. I examined your body just now. You cultivated my Universe Clock, so I will teach you all my comprehension of the Universe Clock in my life. This pressure will be quite huge. Once you comprehend it, you will definitely be very powerful. The Immortal King Realm won’t be too far away for you,” Elder Universe said solemnly.
 Boom!
 After saying that, he directly injected a large ball of light into Miss Hong’s spiritual body without giving her much time to react.
 Miss Hong’s body trembled violently. She cried out involuntarily and floated up. She was surrounded by a large ball of energy and couldn’t move at all.
 Elder Universe waved his hand and directly sent her away, disappearing from this strange space.
 …
 In the hall, shrouded in darkness, Miss Hong had already fainted on the ground. Her face was pale and she was drenched in a cold sweat as if she had been fished out of water.
 Her body was stained with blood, and her limbs went soft.
 Although Elder Universe blocked most of the pressure for her, with his terrifying strength, the remaining pressure she needed to bear wasn’t something that the current Miss Hong could easily withstand.
 In a daze, Miss Hong woke up.
 She looked at her current tragic situation. She got up with difficulty and washed her body with her power. The long robe magic treasure on her body changed and washed the bloodstains away. Then, she let herself recover a little strength before she opened the door.
 Lin Jiufeng stood outside the door, his brows tightly furrowed. He couldn’t see what was happening inside.
 However, he smelled blood. He could also feel Miss Hong’s rapidly weakening aura.
 Perhaps executing the Inviting God technique wasn’t as easy as Miss Hong said.
 Lin Jiufeng’s mood was complicated.
 For his matter, Miss Hong actually paid such a huge price.
 He remembered this favor in his heart.
 When the door opened, what Lin Jiufeng saw was the delicate and weak Miss Hong.
 If the previous Miss Hong was a large red peony that bloomed beautifully, then the current her was a peony that had been beaten by the wind and rain. The leaves had drooped, lost their luster, and lost their vigor.
 “Why is your body so weak?” Lin Jiufeng asked in concern.
 “It’s nothing. This is just a simple sequela.” Miss Hong’s body still didn’t have much strength. She leaned against the door, revealed a pale smile, and said softly.
 “You injured your source energy.” Lin Jiufeng looked at Miss Hong solemnly.
 “I shouldn’t have come to look for you. I can look for others to decipher the map, but you injured your source energy because of me. This shouldn’t have happened.” Lin Jiufeng blamed himself.
 Miss Hong smiled slightly. “In actual fact, you really can’t find anyone else to help you on this. I should be the only one in this world who can solve this map. Even if others know the information of the map, they won’t be able to bring you in.”
 Lin Jiufeng looked at Miss Hong, puzzled.
 “I met Elder Universe, a senior of our Heavenly Dao Sect. I communicated with him and he told me the details of this map,” Miss Hong said slowly.
 She was very weak. She leaned against the door, her body weak.
 Lin Jiufeng hurriedly supported her to a chair and let her sit down, watching with concern.
 “You need to recuperate now. You can’t act rashly regarding matters of the source energy. Let’s talk about the map in the future,” Lin Jiufeng said solemnly.
 “It’s not a problem. I will recover this little bit of source energy after resting for a period of time. Elder Universe has already helped me resist a lot of pressure. Because my cultivation level is too weak, I can’t withstand the pressure of his huge cultivation base. This is why my source energy is injured. But if there’s a price to pay, there’s also a reward to be gained. I’ve already figured out the information on the map,” Miss Hong said.
 “Alright, let’s not talk about the map first. You need to rest, I will help you to your bed. Just rest and recover your source energy first. When you are better, we will discuss this matter again. Your body is important, I’m not in a hurry at all.” Lin Jiufeng interrupted Miss Hong and forcefully brought her to rest. He didn’t dare to be careless regarding the injury of the source energy.
 If anything happened to Miss Hong because of him, Lin Jiufeng would feel guilty for the rest of his life.

                    



 Chapter 307: Entering the Third World  Miss Hong rested for three days.
 Lin Jiufeng stayed by the lake in the Mountain Sea Realm for three days.
 In the past three days, he had been paying close attention to Miss Hong’s injuries. However, she sent Lin Jiufeng away and stayed in her room to treat her injuries with the Universe Clock mystic technique.
 The Universe Clock transformed into a huge bell that surrounded Miss Hong. It absorbed the various energies of the world and patched up her source energy.
 There was also the insight of the Universe Clock that Elder Universe comprehended throughout his life. To Miss Hong, her injury this time might instead be a blessing in disguise.
 Three days later, she appeared by the lake.
 Her weakness from three days ago was gone. The current her had a rosy complexion, wore a long dress, and had a ponytail. She looked at Lin Jiufeng with a light smile.
 “Have your injuries healed?” Lin Jiufeng asked in surprise.
 “No, I’ve only stabilized my injuries now, but I won’t be able to do anything for the time being. I wonder if the number one powerhouse in the world, Great Emperor Jiufeng, can protect a weak woman like me well?” Miss Hong asked with a smile.
 “I will protect you well,” Lin Jiufeng said firmly. Miss Hong was injured because of him, Lin Jiufeng definitely had to protect her well.
 Miss Hong’s eyes were gentle as she said in a relaxed manner, “I’m relieved then. We are going to the Third World soon. With you protecting me, I instantly feel a strong sense of security.”
 Lin Jiufeng asked curiously, “The Third World?”
 “It’s the place marked on your map. I asked Elder Universe. He said that that place is called the Third World. It was once the territory of the God Race. The connection to the main world has been sealed,” Miss Hong said.
 She was no different from a normal person now.
 The only difference was that she couldn’t use her huge cultivation base at all and had to use it to repair her source energy.
 “The village on this map is actually the former territory of the God Race, the Third World!” Lin Jiufeng looked at the map in surprise.
 “How do we go to this Third World?” He asked.
 “The route is in my mind. You have to bring me along,” Miss Hong said with a smile.
 “Sure. We’ve known each other for more than a hundred years, but we’ve never traveled a distance together. Do I have the honor to invite you to the Third World with me?” Lin Jiufeng asked with a smile.
 “It’s my great honor!” Miss Hong replied seriously before revealing a smile.
 “Then where are we going now?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “Hengduan Mountain Range!” Miss Hong said.
 “Hengduan Mountain Range? This place isn’t that far from the Northwest Territory.” Lin Jiufeng immediately remembered.
 Outside the Hengduan Mountain Range was the Western Regions. There were many Buddhist sects there. There were also many beautiful sceneries and natural grasslands in the Western Regions.
 It was the borders of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 “The entrance to the Third World is the Hengduan Mountain Range. When we reach there, we need to find the time node and then use a mystic technique to enter,” Miss Hong said.
 “Then, let’s leave now.” Immortal energy appeared around Lin Jiufeng’s body. He separated a wisp out and lifted Miss Hong with it. Then, he flew with her and left the Mountain Sea Realm.
 With Lin Jiufeng’s current speed, even though he was carrying Miss Hong, he was still very fast. The Hengduan Mountain Range wasn’t far from the Northwest Territory, but it wasn’t that close either. It would take a few days for others to travel, but for Lin Jiufeng, he arrived in 15 minutes.
 And this was because he was afraid of hurting Miss Hong if he flew too fast.
 The Hengduan Mountain Range was similar to the Kunlun Mountains. It was majestic and imposing, towering into the clouds. The top of the mountains was covered in pure white snow, and the bottom of the mountains was lush and green.
 Here, the sky and land were both vast. When the wind blew and pressed down the weeds, cattle and sheep could be seen.
 The blue sky, white clouds, and the breeze here were all different from the Central Plains.
 Here, the world looked vast. Looking into the distance, everything could be seen.
 “The Hengduan Mountain Range is a beautiful scenic line that isolates the Western Region from the Central Plains. Crossing the Hengduan Mountain Range is the Western Region. There are many Buddhist sects there, and most of them are ascetic monks. They have believed in Buddhism all their lives and persevered through it. They are different from us,” Miss Hong said.
 “Have you been there?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “I was lucky enough to go there once. It’s indeed very pure there. There are ascetics everywhere. For the sake of faith in their hearts, they knelt down and worshiped the Buddhist and Bodhisattva in their hearts. That’s why I said that they are very pure people,” Miss Hong said.
 “I have to take a look when I have the chance.” Lin Jiufeng yearned to visit the Western Regions.
 “Let’s go to the Third World first,” Miss Hong said.
 “Where is the entrance to the Third World?” Lin Jiufeng looked at the surrounding mountains. He couldn’t find it.
 “Use this mystic technique.” Miss Hong taught Lin Jiufeng a mystic technique.
 It was passed down to her by Elder Universe. She couldn’t use it now, so she handed it to Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng received the mystic technique and instantly mastered it. Then, he formed a seal with his hand and formed one seal after another at the foot of the Hengduan Mountain Range.
 These seals danced in the air, seemingly searching for something. Finally, they flew in a direction.
 “Let’s go, follow the seals,” Miss Hong immediately said.
 Lin Jiufeng hurriedly followed, bringing along Miss Hong. Their speeds were very fast. Following behind these seals, they arrived at a broken wall of the Hengduan Mountain Range.
 The broken wall was very flat. There were no weeds, and it was very neat like a huge mirror.
 The seals flew over and directly collided with the broken wall.
 Buzz!
 Ripples actually appeared on the broken wall, as if a stone had been smashed into the calm water surface, causing water to splash and waves to appear.
 Then, an entrance appeared in the broken wall.
 Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.
 “I’ll go in first. Follow me. If anything happens, I will protect you well,” Lin Jiufeng said to Miss Hong.
 Miss Hong nodded.
 Lin Jiufeng took the lead and walked into the rippling wall.
 It was like a water gate, hiding a completely different world inside.
 The path was narrow at the beginning, just enough for one person to walk. After walking for tens of steps, the view in front suddenly became clear. The land was flat and the houses were upright. There were fields, beautiful ponds, and bamboo trees. The roads were filled with chickens and dogs. Among them, there were all sorts of activities, and both men and women were dressed in a foreign style. Their yellow hair drooped down, and they were happy with their lives.
 This was the scene that Lin Jiufeng saw.
 It wasn’t as dangerous as he initially thought. This so-called Third World was completely a utopia. It was stable, happy, and relaxed.
 Miss Hong also saw it. She whispered, “How did the Third World of the God Race become an ordinary village?”
 Lin Jiufeng shook his head. “I don’t know either, but I can see that the cultivation bases of the people here are generally not high.”
 The cultivation bases of the people who were farming were really not high. The most powerful ones were only at the Five Decays Realm.
 Facing the arrival of Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong, the people here were also stunned. All of them looked at him, not knowing what had happened.
 “You guys are… from outside?” At this moment, an old man walked over and asked curiously.
 Lin Jiufeng nodded and asked, “Are you all descendants of the God Race?”

                    



 Chapter 308: White Dragon  Lin Jiufeng’s question stunned the people in the village.
 “Descendant of the God Race. I haven’t heard of this name in a long time.” The old man was in a daze for a while before he said with emotion.
 “How did you guys become like this?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “Please have a cup of tea and rest your feet. There aren’t many people here. We are the descendants of the God Race, but the number of people here has decreased over the years.” The old man invited Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong to his home for a chat.
 Lin Jiufeng nodded. He had nothing to be afraid of. Among these people, there was really no one who was particularly powerful. Their cultivation bases were generally low.
 Being the descendants of the God Race, yet their cultivation base was very low. Something must have happened.
 Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong followed the old man to his bamboo house.
 This was a village built at the foot of the mountain. It was filled with bamboo houses scattered everywhere, forming a poetic and picturesque scene with the mountain behind it.
 Green mountain, bamboo houses, the setting sun, and smoke.
 When these were combined, it created a painting in this Small World.
 On the way, Lin Jiufeng asked the old man, “Are there only so few people here?”
 Along the way, Lin Jiufeng saw some people working in the fields and some others fishing leisurely, drinking tea, and chatting.
 The feeling everyone gave Lin Jiufeng was that they were living a very leisurely and slow life.
 These people also looked at Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong with curious expressions, but no one came forward and they instead let the old man bring Lin Jiufeng to the village.
 In the bamboo house, the old man brought tea for Lin Jiufeng. He said with a smile, “This tea was grown by themselves. The taste should be different from what you people drink outside. The breed of this tea tree was passed down more than 20,000 years ago. It can be considered an ancient tea.”
 Miss Hong picked up her teacup and said in surprise, “The tea tree has been here for more than 20,000 years? You guys preserved it so well?”
 Lin Jiufeng took a sip of the tea. A refreshing fragrance lingered between his lips and teeth, making him feel comfortable all over. He said happily, “It’s indeed good tea.”
 The old man laughed and said rather proudly, “All these years, the only thing I’m proud of is this tea tree. It’s perfectly preserved and even more outstanding than 20,000 years ago.”
 As soon as these words came out, Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong looked at the old man in a daze.
 But the old man didn’t notice it. He continued, “When you guys drink this tea, you won’t feel anything at first. But at night, when you meditate and cultivate, you will feel that your entire body is bright, the Great Dao is in front of your eyes, the world is so clear, and the flow of everything is so interesting.”
 “This is a tea tree grown from the branch of the Dao Comprehension Tea Tree, the Small Dao Comprehension Tea Tree!” The old man introduced proudly.
 Lin Jiufeng’s heart trembled. This tea tree was grown from the branch of the Dao Comprehension Tea Tree?
 Miss Hong’s wrist trembled, almost jumping up in fright. She hurriedly picked up the teacup with both hands and looked at the tea leaves floating in the tea. She was extremely shocked.
 “Elder, how old are you this year?” Lin Jiufeng took a deep breath to calm himself down before asking softly.
 “Me?”
 “About… more than 20,000 years old. I haven’t counted in detail, but I must be more than 20,000 years old. I remember that when I was young, the Immortal Court was still around.” The old man recalled.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the old man. With a stomach full of questions, he asked, “Old Sir, your cultivation base is only at the Five Decays Realm. How did you extend your life for so many years?”
 Miss Hong nodded too. “Even if you are an immortal, you can only live for 10,000 to less than 20,000 years. You have lived for more than 20,000 years, and you are still so energetic and healthy?”
 The old man looked at Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong. He laughed out loud and said, “Is what can be seen with the naked eye definitely real?”
 “I look like I’m at the Five Decays Realm now, but is my cultivation base really only at the Five Decays Realm?” The old man asked Miss Hong.
 “Then, what exactly is your cultivation base?” Miss Hong asked curiously.
 “The Five Decays of the Celestial Being Realm,” The old man pointed at himself and said.
 “Didn’t you sense it yourself?”
 Miss Hong: “…”
 Lin Jiufeng couldn’t help but laugh. He looked at the old man and asked, “Senior, how should I address you?”
 “White Dragon!” The old man stroked his beard and said with a smile.
 “Senior White Dragon, how many descendants of the gods are there here?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “Not many. More than 90 people, less than 100,” White Dragon said.
 “Senior…” Miss Hong wanted to ask more, but she was interrupted by White Dragon.
 “You guys asked me a few questions, now it’s my turn to ask you guys, right?” White Dragon chuckled.
 “Go ahead.” Lin Jiufeng nodded. It was naturally right for him to answer any questions White Dragon had.
 “Who are you people? What’s the situation in the outside world? Tell me honestly.” White Dragon asked solemnly.
 Lin Jiufeng looked at Miss Hong. Then, he honestly told White Dragon about his origins, Miss Hong’s origins, and the situation of the outside world.
 There was nothing to hide.
 White Dragon listened silently. He drank his tea and pondered.
 After a long time, Lin Jiufeng explained his situation clearly. The sky outside had already darkened.
 He finished the last bit of tea and let out a long breath.
 White Dragon basically understood the situation of the outside world now.
 He had been observing Lin Jiufeng all this time and didn’t discover that Lin Jiufeng was lying to him. He was confident in his judgment.
 Although he was at the Five Decays Realm, it was unknown where he got the confidence in being able to confirm if Lin Jiufeng’s words were true or false.
 “The sky has already darkened. I’ll go prepare dinner for you guys and treat you guys to some special food of the God Race. There’s nothing like it in the outside world.” White Dragon looked at the sky and stood up to say. With that said, he walked into the back kitchen and got busy.
 Miss Hong reached out and tapped Lin Jiufeng’s waist. She said in a low voice, “You’ve been talking all afternoon, but we didn’t find any useful information.”
 Lin Jiufeng smiled and said, “We are guests, outsiders. If we want him to tell the truth, we have to tell the truth first. Don’t be anxious. He has already treated us to the tea leaves of the Small Dao Comprehension Tea Tree. Are you still afraid that he won’t tell us?”
 “If I treat others sincerely, they will definitely treat me sincerely too,” Lin Jiufeng said confidently.
 White Dragon wasn’t a despicable person. Lin Jiufeng trusted his eyes.
 Moreover, since they needed his help, they had to show their sincerity.
 Lin Jiufeng had told him everything that White Dragon wanted to know. Then, White Dragon would definitely tell him everything that Lin Jiufeng wanted to know in return.
 “The blind confidence of men.” Miss Hong supported her chin with her hand and mumbled.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t continue to answer. Instead, he looked in front of him silently.
 A line of words appeared.
 [Entered the Third World (incomplete)? Do you wish to Sign in?]
 Lin Jiufeng was staring at the word (incomplete).
 ‘This Third World is incomplete?’ Lin Jiufeng muttered in his heart.
 He didn’t expect that instead of being able to sign in immediately after entering, the sign-in only came after he stayed for a whole afternoon and night fell.
 But he had no right to refuse.
 “Sign in!”
 [Sign-In successful. Received the Friendship Badge of the God Race!]
 When Lin Jiufeng saw this notification, he immediately remembered his title of [Real Man].
 They should be of the same type.
 ‘What is this Friendship Badge?’ Lin Jiufeng searched for information.
 [The Friendship Badge of the God Race. After wearing it, one will naturally receive the friendship of the God Race. When the people of the God Race look at you, they will naturally feel a sense of intimacy with you. You can get along well with them with just a few words and quickly become bosom brothers.]
 This was the information regarding the Friendship Badge. It wasn’t useful for Lin Jiufeng’s cultivation base because it wasn’t powerful overall. It only had one function.
 But in the current situation, it was a treasure that couldn’t be bought with money.
 He really lacked the confidence to make the descendants of the God Race believe in him.
 Now that he had signed in to this, he was confident that he could gain the trust of the people here and learn more about the God Race.
 Perhaps he could even learn some of the situation of the past from the mouths of the descendants of the God Race, the truth buried by history.
 Hence, Lin Jiufeng was very satisfied with the reward of the sign-in this time.
 White Dragon swiftly cooked three meat and three vegetable dishes. They were all simple farm dishes, but the wine that he took out smelled delicious and made people drool.
 Even Miss Hong’s eyes lit up. She licked her lips with her pink tongue and watched eagerly.
 She was also a wine lover.
 “This wine is good stuff. Back then, during the age of the God Race, there was a Wine God. His brewing technique was invincible. During the war of the gods and immortals, he brewed more than 10,000 jars of good wine and buried them underground. He left them here. After so many years, we drank a lot of them one after another. We don’t have much left now,” White Dragon chuckled and said.
 He filled Lin Jiufeng’s cup with wine and looked at Miss Hong.
 Without needing to ask, Miss Hong consciously raised the wine cup.
 White Dragon laughed. He admired Miss Hong’s character very much and filled her cup.
 “Let the three of us have a drink together,” White Dragon raised his wine cup and said.
 “Sure. The two of us are born in this era, we didn’t expect to be able to drink such good wine. It’s simply our honor.” Lin Jiufeng smiled slightly. He raised his wine cup and drank it in one gulp.
 Miss Hong also drank it in one gulp. Then, she felt comfortable all over. Her face was red, and she smacked her lips cutely. “The taste is excellent. It’s the best wine I’ve ever drunk.”
 White Dragon placed this jar of good wine in front of Miss Hong and said, “In the afternoon, you guys told me everything you know. I choose to believe you guys. It’s your turn to ask me tonight. I will also tell you everything I know.”
 Lin Jiufeng was overjoyed upon hearing this. It was the same for Miss Hong. They really had a lot of questions.
 “Have you really lived for more than 20,000 years?” Miss Hong asked with a red face.
 “Really.” White Dragon nodded.
 “Then, what’s your cultivation base?” Miss Hong looked at White Dragon, puzzled.
 “Is the cultivation base of the Five Decays Realm very low?” White Dragon asked with a smile.
 “There should be a reason for this, right? The Five Decays Realm can at most live for a few hundred years. Even if you used all sorts of methods to extend your life, you still couldn’t live past 800 years. How did you live for 20,000 years?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “My current cultivation base is at the Five Decays Realm, but that doesn’t mean that my previous cultivation base was also only at this realm,” White Dragon said.
 Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong were all ears.
 White Dragon pointed at Miss Hong and Lin Jiufeng. He shook his head and said, “The two of you are now immortals who have stepped into the Nine Restrictions Realm, but it will be a little difficult for you to live for more than 20,000 years. Unless you can enter the second lifetime at the last moment of your life. Only then will you have a chance. But that will be too difficult. No one in our village can do it.”
 “You just said that no one in the village can live until the second lifetime. Doesn’t that mean that these people are from the same era as you?” Miss Hong asked in surprise.
 “Of course. Other than one child, the others in this village are all of the same generation as me. In the past, we were much stronger than the two of you. Although we weren’t top-notch in the God Race, we were still outstanding. That’s why we were able to live for more than 20,000 years until now.” White Dragon explained tirelessly.
 “Then what happened to your cultivation bases?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “Our cultivation bases? We used it to strengthen and repair the seal.” White Dragon ate a mouthful of food and said casually.
 “Seal?” Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.
 Sure enough, this God Race village wasn’t simple. Only now did White Dragon reveal a little of the truth.
 “Is there a seal here?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “Of course.” White Dragon looked at Lin Jiufeng and directly said with a smile, “Don’t keep asking me. I’ll directly tell you what happened in this place over the past 20,000 years.”
 Lin Jiufeng immediately raised his wine cup. “Let me toast you.”
 Miss Hong also raised her wine cup. “I toast you too.”
 White Dragon gulped down the wine in his cup. He looked at Lin Jiufeng and suddenly felt a sense of intimacy. Recalling how Lin Jiufeng told him everything honestly in the afternoon, he had the desire to tell him everything too.
 “This used to be a vast world called the Third World.”
 “It’s the territory of our God Race. It’s actually not that different from the main world. The main world is the First World and this is the Third World. This world also has a lot of source energies. When I was young, my life was actually carefree.”
 “But all of this disappeared after we went up against the Immortal Court.”
 White Dragon recalled the past. His eyes were in a daze as if he was seeing the glory of the God Race 20,000 years ago.
 Compared to today, the situation of the God Race during that time and now was really worlds apart.
 “Do you know why this place has become like this?” White Dragon looked at Lin Jiufeng and asked.
 Lin Jiufeng shook his head. He personally filled the wine cup for White Dragon and then drank the wine in his cup in one gulp.
 White Dragon took another sip of wine. His face was slightly red. This wine was brewed by a master brewer of the God Race. It was a wine that could make immortals drunk.
 “The battle between the God Race and the Immortal Court spread to several Major Chiliocosms. They even shattered several worlds. The Third World is no exception. A War God from the Immortal Court came here and wanted to destroy the Third World, but he was defeated by a powerhouse of the God Race. But the War God’s life force was powerful and couldn’t be killed, so we set up a huge array to seal the War God.”
 “Then, the great war between the gods and the immortals broke out. The powerhouses of the God Race joined the war one after another. The fighting in the outside world was very intense, leaving only us young people to guard the Third World.”
 “This guarding lasted for 20,000 years!”
 White Dragon said sadly. He himself didn’t know if he was feeling regret or something else.
 The feeling he felt didn’t seem to be as serious as to be called regret.
 But he was unwilling to accept this situation. 20,000 years of time had been spent here.
 “Why didn’t you leave? Wasn’t that War God of the Immortal Court already suppressed by you guys?” Miss Hong asked curiously.
 “The power of the seal is weakening year by year. Our village once had more than 90 immortals. They weren’t only at the Nine Restrictions like you guys, but were powerful people who could each be used to suppress an era.”
 “We infused the majority of our energy into that array to reinforce the seal, thereby weakening our cultivation bases.”
 “So what you saw was that our cultivation bases are really only at the Five Decays Realm.”
 White Dragon answered Miss Hong’s doubts honestly.

                    



 Chapter 309: Immortal Court Female War Goddess  Through what White Dragon said, Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong finally understood why this place was once the territory of the God Race, but the people inside were all very weak.
 The reason was still related to the Immortal Court.
 A War God of the Immortal Court was suppressed here. More than 90 powerhouses who were once immortals and above continuously suppressed this place for 20,000 years, depleting their cultivation bases.
 This was why the strongest people Lin Jiufeng saw here were only at the Five Decays Realm.
 “If you guys were so powerful, why didn’t you kill this War God?” Miss Hong asked, baffled.
 “If it was possible, we would also want to do this. But the truth is that with our combined strength and relying on the array formation set up by our predecessors, we barely managed to suppress this War God. We are unable to do anything else.” White Dragon drank a mouthful of wine and said regretfully.
 “The War God of the Immortal Court is that powerful?” Lin Jiufeng asked in surprise.
 “The War Gods of the Immortal Court are indeed very powerful, but the War God of each generation is different. The War God of the Immortal Court back then is different from the War God of the current Immortal Court. This female War God has a very powerful background. She was the source of confidence of the Immortal Court in fighting that battle. For this reason, the top powerhouses of the God Race set up a huge array back then and lured her into the array formation to suppress her. They didn’t want her to come out and cause trouble and affect the outcome of that battle,” White Dragon explained.
 “This Immortal Court War God is actually a woman?” Miss Hong looked at White Dragon in surprise. She thought that this War God was a man. After all, not just anyone could bear the name of the War God.
 “Yes, it’s a woman. She’s very powerful. In that battle, she caused more than half of the Third World to collapse. Right now, only the current region we are in is stable. The other regions are all shrouded in chaos. Occasionally, a continent will appear, but it’s also extremely unstable, so it’s impossible to live in it. Therefore, we, the descendants of the God Race, stay here and guard this female War God. Not letting her break free is our priority now,” White Dragon nodded and said.
 “In that case, how much longer can you guys suppress her?” Lin Jiufeng asked worriedly.
 If these descendants of the God Race failed to suppress this female War God and let her come into being, it would have a huge impact on the First World, which was also the main world, that had finally become peaceful.
 Lin Jiufeng had to take precautions.
 “I don’t know either.” White Dragon shook his head.
 “We’ve been persevering. We suppressed her again not long ago, but compared to the previous time, the duration she will be suppressed this time is very, very short.”
 “In the beginning, when we suppressed this female War God, we could have lasted for at least 3,000 years. It wasn’t until 3,000 years later that the seal started to weaken. But the second time, we could only maintain it for 2,800 years. Then, it was 2,500 years, 2,000 years, 1,500 years, 1,000 years…”
 “Until now, every time we tried our best to infuse energy into the seal, but we could only suppress her for decades. The more we suppressed her, the more difficult it became. Three years ago, we only just suppressed her. The gap between this time and the previous time is only a short 60 years.”
 “Therefore, we can’t guarantee that we will still be able to recover to our peak when she wakes up next time.”
 “The suppression over the years has also exhausted our spirit, energy, and soul. It’s been three years, but our cultivation has only recovered to the Five Decays Realm.”
 As White Dragon spoke, Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong listened. Their faces were solemn.
 White Dragon’s words carried a deep sense of helplessness. Clearly, they were a little powerless now.
 “In other words, the next time this female War God wakes up will be about 50 years later?” Lin Jiufeng deduced solemnly.
 “Yes, maybe less than 50 years, but it’s obvious that we won’t be able to recover to our peak cultivation base in 50 years. We won’t be able to continue suppressing her,” White Dragon said helplessly.
 “That’s why we came,” Lin Jiufeng said solemnly.
 “You guys…” White Dragon looked at Lin Jiufeng, shook his head, and said,” You guys have just entered the Nine Restrictions Realm. To many people, you guys are very powerful, but in front of the Immortal Court War God, even if you guys break through the Nine Restrictions and enter the Perfected Immortal Realm in 50 years, you guys will only just be cannon fodders.”
 These words were very straightforward.
 But Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong weren’t infuriated at all.
 Because what he said was the truth.
 The first realm of the immortals was the Immortal Realm. In the Immortal Realm, there were the Nine Restrictions of the Immortal. One could enter the next realm after crossing the Nine Restrictions.
 The next realm was the Perfected Immortal Realm!
 Of course, there were also people who didn’t cross the Nine Restrictions and directly broke through to the Perfected Immortal Realm.
 But such combat power was completely incomparable to those who crossed the Nine Restrictions.
 Miss Hong asked curiously, “The next step for an immortal is to become a Perfected Immortal, then what’s next after the Perfected Immortal Realm? What realm are you guys at? And what realm is that Immortal Court War God at?”
 Lin Jiufeng was also very curious about this matter.
 He had investigated countless books in the mortal realm, but there was no introduction to the realms after the Immortal Realm.
 There were too few immortals in the mortal realm.
 He didn’t even know about the Nine Restrictions previously. If Lin Jiufeng hadn’t seen that old man enter the Nine Restrictions, he wouldn’t even know of it.
 “After the Immortal Realm is the Perfected Immortal Realm, then the Mystic Immortal Realm, the Ancestral Immortal Realm, the Sovereign Immortal Realm, and then the Immortal King Realm.”
 “Among us, the majority are Ancestral Immortals. I’m a Sovereign Immortal, but that Immortal Court War God is at the Immortal King Realm.”
 “This is what makes us feel pressure.”
 White Dragon said regretfully.
 Lin Jiufeng blinked. His heart was turbulent.
 He didn’t expect that the Immortal Realm that he had painstakingly entered was only the beginning of the next stage.
 Perfected Immortal, Mystic Immortal, Ancestral Immortal, Sovereign Immortal, Immortal King.
 Lin Jiufeng had no confidence in surpassing these realms at all in just 50 years.
 Even if he signed in every day and received good items to improve his cultivation base, it would still take a lot of time.
 “Now, do you all know how terrifying this matter is?” White Dragon suddenly chuckled and broke the heavy atmosphere at the table.
 “It’s indeed very serious, especially now that it’s peaceful outside. The common people live and work in peace, and countless people are working hard. The old have people to support them, and the young have people to depend on. Don’t you think it’s a pity if such a beautiful life can only last for 50 years?” Lin Jiufeng said softly.
 He wanted to let the people continue living such a beautiful life.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t care about treasures, cultivation base, or power.
 He could sign in for treasures that improved his cultivation base, and he could also sign in for magic treasures.
 He could live in the Cold Palace for hundreds of years with just Bai Mao’er to accompany him.
 He was indifferent to power and fame. But there were also things he cared about.
 Lin Jiufeng liked a line of a poem.
 ‘Building millions of buildings and protecting the people of the world from the cold.’
 If this sentence was used now, Lin Jiufeng indeed had the ability to achieve it.
 He supported the Yuhua God Dynasty, which brought welfare to the people of the world, protecting the people of the world from the sufferings of the world.
 But now, all of a sudden, he received a piece of alarming news from White Dragon.
 In the Third World, the former territory of the God Race, they had actually suppressed an Immortal Court War God here.
 This Immortal Court War God would wake up about 50 years later.
 Then, she would discover that the Immortal Court had been wiped out 20,000 years ago.
 Would she go crazy?
 Would she destroy the mortal realm and then rebuild the Immortal Court?
 These things needed to be resolved.
 Lin Jiufeng’s originally relaxed mood instantly became solemn and nervous.
 “Actually, you don’t have to worry. There are still some terrifying forces in this world. It’s just that you guys won’t be able to sense them usually.” White Dragon comforted Lin Jiufeng.
 “What kind of forces?” Lin Jiufeng looked up at White Dragon.
 “In the Western Desert, I once felt a terrifying force that temporarily erupted. There’s a powerhouse in the Western Desert,” White Dragon said.
 “The Buddhist sects in the Western Desert?” Lin Jiufeng frowned.
 A hundred years ago, when Emperor Yuan was still around, he exterminated the Buddhist sects in the Jiangnan area.
 As a result, Lin Jiufeng’s impression of the Buddhist sects was still negative even now.
 “The Buddhist sects of the Western Desert are very different from the Buddhist sects that you know. If you have the chance, go to the Western Desert. I remember that there was once an ultimate powerhouse in the Western Desert.” White Dragon recalled.
 “Ultimate powerhouse?” Lin Jiufeng raised his brows.
 “I think his name is Great Emperor Shakyamuni. He’s a terrifying Buddhist Supremacy throughout the river of time. Just like you, Great Emperor Jiufeng, the people of the world also address him as Great Emperor. Titles like Buddha and the like can no longer express their respect for him,” White Dragon said.
 “Have you seen Great Emperor Shakyamuni before?” Miss Hong asked.
 “How could I have seen him before? Great Emperor Shakyamuni appeared 100,000 years ago. He was the supreme emperor, an invincible Supremacy who walked out of the Buddhist sects back then. No one knows of his deeds anymore. As time passed, your generation no longer knows of Great Emperor Shakyamuni, but I’ve heard of his name back then. The higher-ups of our God Race are very respectful to Great Emperor Shakyamuni and respect him as the living emperor.” White Dragon shared his childhood memories.
 “That’s why I highly recommend you take a trip to the Western Desert to see if there are any other forces hidden in the Western Desert. If you can find this force, it might be useful against the War God,” White Dragon said to Lin Jiufeng.
 Lin Jiufeng nodded and remembered these words in his heart. He agreed. “I will go to the Western Desert.”
 “I wonder if we can go take a look at this Immortal Court War God?” Miss Hong suddenly asked.
 “Sure, but the sky is already dark. Let’s go tomorrow.” White Dragon looked at the night sky and said.
 “No problem, let’s have a drink.” Lin Jiufeng toasted again. White Dragon didn’t stand on ceremony and drank it all in one gulp.
 That night, Lin Jiufeng, Miss Hong, and White Dragon drank until their faces turned red. They stopped after having their fill. In the end, they stayed in White Dragon’s bamboo house.
 Miss Hong directly fell asleep. Her face was pink, and her body carried a beautiful light. Under the moonlight, the injuries in her body were actually slowly recovering. As for herself, she sank into the sea of Great Dao.
 The tea in the day was from a tea tree transplanted from the Dao Comprehension Tea Tree. Its tea leaves also carried a portion of the effect of the Dao Comprehension Tea Tree. It was just nice to help Miss Hong recover and improve herself.
 Lin Jiufeng was also cultivating.
 To him, he was already used to being drunk. At night, he experienced the benefits of the cup of tea. He sent his spiritual consciousness into the sea of the Great Dao and let his body lie down drunk. His spiritual consciousness and spiritual soul were both in the sea of Great Dao, quickly comprehending it.
 Previously, Lin Jiufeng had signed in to the Dao Comprehension Tea Tree and had long had the experience of roaming the sea of the Great Dao. Therefore, he was very skilled this time. He quickly found something suitable for him to comprehend and absorbed it to improve himself.
 ‘There are so many realms to cultivate in. I’m only at the Immortal Realm now, I can’t be arrogant and complacent. Moreover, there are still many challenges in the future. I need to slowly improve myself.’ Lin Jiufeng reminded himself in his heart.
 He then cultivated as the night passed swiftly.
 Early in the next morning, Lin Jiufeng woke up while the sky was still slightly bright.
 He stretched his body. He didn’t feel hungover at all. He felt refreshed and the realm in his body had also improved slightly.
 Of the Nine Restrictions, he seemed to have reached the third restriction.
 It was just one night, but to Lin Jiufeng, that cup of tea was very useful.
 “The advancement of the Immortal Realm isn’t comparable to before. Many immortals can only improve by this one step in their entire lives. Now, with just a cup of tea and a night, I’ve already taken this one step. It’s already very fast.” Lin Jiufeng was in a good mood. He looked at the distant mountains and breathed in the fresh air, feeling comfortable all over.
 Not long after, Miss Hong woke up.
 Today, she looked rosy, radiant, and much more energetic than yesterday.
 “That cup of tea is really not bad. Yesterday night, more than half of the damage to my source energy was directly healed. I just need to rest well next, the injury shouldn’t affect my subsequent cultivation,” Miss Hong said happily.
 Lin Jiufeng was also happy for her. “That’s great. If anything happens to you, I will feel so guilty. You were injured because of me.”
 Miss Hong rolled her eyes at Lin Jiufeng. “I’m doing this for myself. I met Elder Universe and asked a lot of things, and I also learned a lot. As for asking for directions for you, that was just a matter of convenience. Don’t think so highly of yourself.”
 Lin Jiufeng laughed and didn’t take it to heart.
 At this moment, White Dragon walked out. He looked at Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong with a ruddy complexion. He said with a smile, “Didn’t you guys want to see that Immortal Court War God? We can go now.”
 Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong instantly became energetic.
 “Lead the way,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 White Dragon brought Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong along the small path in the fields.
 They walked along the way, looked at the scenery, and chatted. They didn’t fly over. Soon, they arrived at a huge mountain.
 The mountain was majestic, vast, and green. But inside, the area where Lin Jiufeng and the others came to was barren.
 The ground was dark green, and the surrounding rocks were also green. There were no trees or weeds around, it was empty.
 From the sky, this place looked like a green stone deep in a mountain.
 Emerald green energy flowed everywhere. It was very beautiful and lingered around, making this place look like a dreamland.
 Miss Hong reached out, wanting to touch the green energy flowing in the air. The green energy immediately became like a naughty child, flowing around Miss Hong and surrounding her.
 “Look, this green energy seems to have a mind of its own,” Miss Hong said.
 Unexpectedly, White Dragon took a look and immediately shouted, “Hurry up and get away from this energy.”
 Lin Jiufeng’s expression froze. He raised his hand and patted towards Miss Hong’s shoulder.
 Boom!
 His energy poured down, and within a second, the green energy surrounding Miss Hong’s body was sent flying.
 Miss Hong asked nervously, “Is there any harm in this energy?”
 “This energy was subconsciously released by that female War God of the Immortal Court. It should be her energy. Once it surrounds you and makes you let down your guard, it will enter your body and devour your energy and flesh. At that time, you won’t be able to save yourself even if you want to,” White Dragon said solemnly.
 Miss Hong looked at the green energy in fear.
 Lin Jiufeng protected her. He said with a serious expression, “From now on, we can’t touch anything here randomly. Let’s be careful.”
 “It’s not that exaggerated. These green energies are all unconscious. Only when you take the initiative to come into contact with them can you possibly be infected. Just be careful.” White Dragon reminded them.
 Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong remembered this in their hearts. Then, they followed White Dragon and soon arrived at a blue lake.
 This blue lake was a little similar to the one Lin Jiufeng saw in the Undying Mountain in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.
 But the difference was that there was a transparent frost jade coffin floating on this blue lake.
 Inside the coffin laid a woman quietly. She was dressed in a white dress with long black hair. Her face was clean, and she looked like a young girl from a humble family.
 At this moment, White Dragon spoke up, “This is the female War God of the Immortal Court.”
 Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong looked at each other silently.
 This girl who looked neighborly-like was actually the Immortal Court’s female War God…

                    



 Chapter 310: Sea of Books  The female War God of the Immortal Court laid quietly in the transparent coffin, floating on the blue lake, quiet and peaceful.
 She looked just like the neighborly kind of girl who lived next door. The only distinguishing feature was long hair, each of which was crystal clear.
 The transparent frost jade coffin floated on the water surface. Wherever it passed, waves would appear, surging with blue energy that filled the surroundings.
 “The female War God of the Immortal Court looks very quiet like this,” Miss Hong said.
 “If only she had been so quiet all this time. Then, we wouldn’t have to expend so much effort and we can let her out now,” White Dragon said helplessly.
 “50 years…” Lin Jiufeng looked at the Immortal Court War God as he calculated the time in his heart.
 50 years later, the world would face the attack of this female War God.
 Would the world be able to withstand it?
 Lin Jiufeng wasn’t confident.
 “Do we have any chance of killing this female War God now?” Lin Jiufeng asked White Dragon, unwilling to give up.
 Even though he knew that it was impossible, he still wanted to ask.
 “That’s impossible. You’re facing an Immortal King, a female War God of the Immortal Court. There’s no doubt about her strength. Even if you destroy her body, she can still revive.” White Dragon shook his head.
 “Then, 50 years later, we will have to face this War God.” Lin Jiufeng sighed. He was under a lot of pressure.
 “Yes, the Third World has actually been more or less destroyed, but the First World, which is also the main world, is still intact. The common people live and work in peace, and the Yuhua God Dynasty rules the world. But all of this will disappear after this female War God wakes up.”
 “Everything that exists now will disappear. If you want to maintain the original state, then think of a way to solve this problem in front of you.” White Dragon advised Lin Jiufeng.
 The trouble in front of him!
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the quiet woman in the frost jade coffin. He found it hard to believe that she would destroy the world 50 years later.
 But this was the truth. He had no choice but to believe it.
 As Lin Jiufeng continued to look, a line of words suddenly appeared before his eyes.
 [Do you want to Sign-In before the Immortal Court War God?]
 Lin Jiufeng agreed decisively. He couldn’t wait to sign in for more treasures or pills to improve his strength.
 This way, he would have the confidence to face this female War God 50 years later.
 [Sign-In successful. Received the Immortal Court’s Origin Daoist Book!]
 Lin Jiufeng frowned and looked at the blue lake water. He was silent, but he was wondering in his heart what kind of treasure was this Origin Daoist Book?
 Since he couldn’t figure it out himself, Lin Jiufeng decided not to think about it anymore and directly read the information.
 [Origin Daoist Book. It is one of the books left behind by a few Grand Supremacy from a long time ago. It records supreme secret techniques. Those who comprehend the Origin Daoist Book will receive the power of the source energies.]
 As for what the power of the source energies was, Lin Jiufeng had no idea. He had yet to comprehend it.
 After understanding the information, Lin Jiufeng directly accepted the Origin Daoist Book. In any case, it was to improve himself, he had no reason to refuse it.
 As soon as the Origin Daoist Book entered his mind, it was as if he had practiced it millions of times. He instantly became familiar with it. Lin Jiufeng also became familiar with the operation of the nomological powers and the use of the cultivation technique inside.
 Energy surged in his body and he directly broke through several of the Nine Restrictions.
 Previously, he had only taken three steps in the Nine Restrictions. But now, this book directly allowed Lin Jiufeng to take another few steps.
 He seemed to reach the seventh of the Nine Restrictions!
 Almost doubling in the number of steps taken, this was really incredible to Lin Jiufeng.
 He had just felt that it was very difficult to improve in the Immortal Realm. He had worked so hard to comprehend and sign in, but he had only taken three steps in the Nine Restrictions.
 These three steps took him a lot of time.
 But now, a single Origin Daoist Book allowed him to take four steps in a row.
 He was only two steps away from completing the Nine Restrictions.
 Moreover, the benefits brought by the Origin Daoist Book were far more than that. They were very useful for Lin Jiufeng’s future cultivation.
 Beside the blue lake, Lin Jiufeng and the other two stood there. They looked at the Immortal Court War God speechlessly.
 This female War God laid there quietly, but it was already enough to make people apprehensive.
 She was unmoving like a mountain.
 Even so, she brought immense pressure to those facing her.
 One could imagine how terrifying it would be once she woke up and broke free from the shackles of this place.
 After a while, Miss Hong remembered something.
 “Senior White Dragon, I heard from an elder in my sect that the Third World is very interesting and we can learn a lot of things after entering, but we haven’t seen any such things yet. I wonder if you can tell me?” Miss Hong asked curiously.
 This matter was told to her by Elder Universe, she had remembered it in her heart.
 “The Third World is very interesting?” White Dragon was stunned. He thought carefully and finally remembered something.
 “You’re talking about the Time Wheel, right?” White Dragon suddenly understood.
 “Time Wheel? What is it?” Miss Hong’s eyes lit up as she asked curiously.
 “It can consume one’s life energy to activate the Time Wheel and enter the past period, traveling freely in the past. It’s indeed a very interesting thing.” White Dragon explained.
 “There’s such a thing? Doesn’t this interfere with events of the past?” Lin Jiufeng asked in surprise.
 “What happened in the past is already destined. There’s no way to change it. The only thing that can be changed is our future. Many people tried to use the Time Wheel to change the course of history, but the correction power of history made them pay a huge price and they also didn’t achieve anything,” White Dragon told Lin Jiufeng.
 “Then, where is this Time Wheel?” Miss Hong asked curiously.
 “It has already disappeared.” White Dragon sighed.
 “Disappeared?” Miss Hong frowned, her expression stiffened.
 “Back then, the female War God of the Immortal Court entered the Third World and destroyed the Third World. The Time Wheel was also lost at that time. Some people said that it was shattered, and some people said that the Time Wheel left on its own. In any case, we haven’t found it till now,” White Dragon shook his head and said.
 “So, unfortunately, I can’t help you with what you’re thinking. There’s only this small area existing in the Third World now. The scenery isn’t bad, but the interesting things no longer exist,” White Dragon said apologetically.
 Miss Hong waved her hand. “I only remembered it in my heart after hearing it from the elder in my sect. But since it no longer exists, then forget it.”
 “Senior White Dragon, may I take a look at the library of your God Race? I hope to understand more about what happened back then. This way, I can be more mentally prepared.” Lin Jiufeng raised his request.
 He wanted to see the books of the God Race.
 “That won’t be a problem, but I’m afraid that you won’t be able to finish reading everything in the library.” White Dragon didn’t hesitate. He was just a little worried about Lin Jiufeng.
 “Can’t finish reading?” Lin Jiufeng raised his brows. “What do you mean by that?”
 “What I mean is that except for those top-secret books that have been taken away, the rest of the books are all here. There are more books here than you can imagine. Even if I give you 50 years, you won’t be able to finish reading them.” White Dragon waved his hand.
 “There’s so much? That’s great.” Lin Jiufeng’s eyes lit up. He wasn’t afraid of having too much information, but he was afraid of not having enough information.
 “Then I’ll bring you guys to the Sea of Books. It’s suitable for you guys there. When you’re tired of reading, you can just leave this place,” White Dragon said.

                    



 Chapter 311: Nine Pure Immortal Lights  White Dragon had a good impression of Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong. He brought them into the Sea of Books of the God Race.
 As a powerful race that could once compete with the Immortal Court, the God Race was one of the most terrifying factions in the world. Their Sea of Books was really vast.
 A library that could be described as a sea wasn’t that simple.
 After taking one last look at the female War God of the Immortal Court, Lin Jiufeng turned around and left. He followed White Dragon to the green mountain behind the village.
 The green mountain was charming. It had rained in the morning, so the air was moist. Trees, branches, vines, and green grass all carried the morning water vapor to welcome Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong.
 In this green mountain, there was a dimensional space. When White Dragon opened the dimensional space, they could see endless bookshelves inside. On these bookshelves were endless books.
 Miss Hong cried out, “The books of our Heavenly Dao Sect are like playing house compared to the books here.”
 Lin Jiufeng added, “Even the books in the Martial Temples of the Yuhua God Dynasty added up can’t compare to the amount here.”
 White Dragon said proudly, “This is the Sea of Books of my race. There are books in all aspects inside. Be it cultivation techniques, immortal techniques, or anything else, they can be found here.”
 “You even allow us to view the immortal techniques?” Miss Hong looked at White Dragon in surprise.
 White Dragon stood with his hands behind his back. He said very calmly, “As immortals, you will discover in the future that the truly powerful immortal techniques are not something that you can use just by learning them. You still need something huge. You guys don’t have this thing yet.”
 “Moreover, there’s no harm in giving these immortal techniques to you two. If you guys don’t learn it, it will also be a waste to leave it here. It’s been 20,000 years, and the mystic techniques here have basically been lost in the First World. 50 years later, if the War God of the Immortal Court commits a massacre and we die here, no one will be able to discover this Sea of Books in the future,” White Dragon said worriedly.
 This was also the reason why he let Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong come in to read as much as they wanted.
 He even looked at Lin Jiufeng and said, “If you have the ability, move the Sea of Books away and bring them to the First World. To us, it’s a sin to let the Sea of Books be lost forever.”
 “Let me move them away…” Lin Jiufeng was stunned. He didn’t expect the surprise to come so soon.
 “If you don’t move them away, letting them remain here will be akin to a pearl covered in dust. The Sea of Books will be buried in the dust of history, no one will know of it.” White Dragon sighed.
 “If I let you take them away, I can also let the future generations know that in the past, there was a terrifying race like the God Race that fought with the Immortal Court and overturned it. Although there are only a few of us left in the God Race now, we have never lost the face of our ancestors.” White Dragon’s voice was soft, but the power revealed was so surging and powerful.
 “Alright, I will move the Sea of Books away.” Lin Jiufeng nodded. To the Yuhua God Dynasty and the current world where many inheritances of the past had been lost, these books were a precious treasure.
 Especially when there were many records about the God Race inside.
 In the current world, the God Race had already disappeared from the records of history, no one knew of this race anymore. These books could make people understand the history of 20,000 years ago.
 Lin Jiufeng couldn’t ask for more.
 “Are you able to bring them all out?” Miss Hong looked at Lin Jiufeng and asked.
 The Sea of Books was huge and uncountable. This wasn’t something that an ordinary person could move.
 Lin Jiufeng said confidently, “I have a treasure that can move the Sea of Books away.”
 “What treasure? The storage space is that big?” Miss Hong asked in surprise.
 White Dragon also looked at Lin Jiufeng curiously.
 “General Appointing Platform!” Lin Jiufeng took out the General Appointing Platform and floated it in front of him. A desolate killing aura erupted, shocking even White Dragon.
 “This… This is a very ominous item.” White Dragon wanted to approach the General Appointing Platform, but he was sent flying by its energy. He wasn’t allowed to approach at all.
 “It’s indeed a very ominous item. After I obtained it, I’ve never figured out its origins,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 He hoped that White Dragon could solve his doubts.
 But White Dragon shook his head regretfully and said, “I don’t know either. This treasure is also very unfamiliar to me, but this is my problem. I’m inexperienced and don’t know many things. I’ve always been a frog in the well in the Third World, that’s why I don’t recognize this treasure.”
 He spoke very sincerely, thinking that it was his problem not to know the General Appointing Platform.
 This made Lin Jiufeng wave his hand, and he hurriedly said, “It’s not your problem. I don’t recognize it either. We are all the same.”
 “Can this General Appointing Platform contain the Sea of Books?” Miss Hong asked curiously.
 “Yes, it can. I will go in and pack the Sea of Books into it and bring the books to the Martial Temple to spread them to the world. I will let the people of the world know what happened in the past,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “Alright, I’m looking forward to it. The story of the God Race shouldn’t be lost.” White Dragon’s eyes lit up as he said.
 Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong stepped into the Sea of Books together. Under the gaze of White Dragon, the two of them were immersed in the Sea of Books.
 At this moment, countless books drowned Lin Jiufeng. A huge amount of knowledge was waiting for Lin Jiufeng to look through them.
 The moment he stepped into the Sea of Books, Lin Jiufeng directly locked onto his cultivation insights category.
 He didn’t pay attention to historical stories, he didn’t care about immortal techniques, he didn’t care about the secrets of the past…
 He only wanted to know the difficulties and setbacks that would come with cultivating in the future realms.
 Especially when the Immortal Court War God was about to awaken in 50 years. At that time, if the people of the world couldn’t resist her, Lin Jiufeng would have to resist her.
 He had to continuously become stronger in these 50 years.
 Hence, this was also the reason why Lin Jiufeng headed straight for the cultivation insights of countless seniors.
 As for the rest, it wasn’t that he didn’t care. It was just that he temporarily didn’t have the energy to do so. Later on, he would read all the books here once.
 The most important thing now was to read the cultivation insights of countless seniors.
 Miss Hong’s choice was different from Lin Jiufeng’s. She went to see the history of the God Race and the Immortal Court.
 She didn’t lack cultivation insights, nor did she lack immortal-grade mystic techniques. Elder Universe had given all of these to her. As long as she cultivated according to the foundation set by Elder Universe, her future would be boundless.
 Hence, she and Lin Jiufeng went to different places. Soon, they couldn’t see the other party’s figure anymore, and they were drowned in the vast sea of books.
 Lin Jiufeng opened a cultivation manual written by a predecessor. This book recorded the detailed direction in which an immortal advanced in the future.
 “If an immortal wants to break through to the Perfected Immortal Realm, they must comprehend the nomological powers of the Perfected Immortal Realm. The more nomological powers comprehended, the stronger the immortal will become after breaking through.”
 “The nomological powers of the Perfected Immortal Realm are a manifestation of the Great Dao. They are very powerful. Only by condensing the nomological powers of the Perfected Immortal Realm can one enter the Perfected Immortal Realm.”
 “As immortals advanced in the future realms, they will be able to roam freely in the various Great Dao nomological powers. The number of Great Dao nomological powers that you can comprehend will depend on how powerful you are.”
 “I cultivated at the age of three. It has been 8,000 years since then. I entered the Mystic Immortal Realm early, but I was unable to touch the threshold of the Ancestral Immortal Realm. I have just been living a muddled life since and unable to improve.”
 “In sorrow, I wrote down these insights and passed them down to the future generations. I hope that you can press forward in the Mystic Immortal Realm and not be stuck by the Mystic Immortal Tribulation.”
 …
 Lin Jiufeng quickly finished reading the insights of this short piece and fell into deep thought.
 “It turns out that what immortals need to break through to the Perfected Immortal Realm are the nomological powers of the Perfected Immortal.”
 “It’s no wonder that some immortals broke through to the Perfected Immortal Realm even though they didn’t enter the Nine Restrictions of the Immortal stage. It’s because they transformed the Great Dao that they comprehended into nomological powers. Then they entered the Perfected Immortal Realm.”
 “However, this kind of Perfected Immortals are definitely very weak. They definitely won’t be able to break through to the next realm. Therefore, this isn’t the path that I want to take. It’s better for me to obediently complete the Nine Restrictions and then condense the nomological powers of the Perfected Immortal Realm before breaking through to the Perfected Immortal Realm.”
 “After the Perfected Immortal Realm is the Mystic Immortal Realm. In the Mystic Immortal Realm, there seems to be a tribulation too. This immortal who wrote down in his insights that he was trapped in the Mystic Immortal Realm and had no hope of becoming an Ancestral Immortal for the rest of his life.”
 “The path of an immortal is a hurdle with every step. Every inch of land is buried with countless talented immortals. It’s difficult for the people of the world to walk this path, but if they really successfully walked through it, they will definitely become ultimate powerhouses.”
 Lin Jiufeng thought about it carefully and felt the brutality of the immortal path.
 There were only a few sentences in the book. The writing seemed light and casual, but after studying it carefully, he felt a cruel pressure coming from it.
 Lin Jiufeng put down the book and picked up the cultivation insights written by an Ancestral Immortal.
 Basically, it was the same. The cultivation insights of the Ancestral Immortals were also about the cruelness of the immortal path.
 The previous one was stuck at the Mystic Immortal Realm and couldn’t enter the Ancestral Immortal Realm. He felt that the path to the immortal realm was cruel and thought how good it would be if he could find a way to enter the Ancestral Immortal Realm.
 But now, Lin Jiufeng was looking at the cultivation insights of the Ancestral Immortal Realm.
 This Ancestral Immortal’s troubles were exactly the same as that of the previous Mystic Immortal Realm cultivator.
 He was also stuck at the Ancestral Immortal Realm, unable to improve at all.
 He thought of all sorts of methods and exhausted his mental strength, but all his efforts were in vain.
 He was also wailing in his cultivation insights, writing down how good it would be if he could break through to the next realm.
 After reading it, Lin Jiufeng only had one feeling in his heart. “The immortals in the realm after the Ancestral Immortal Realm probably have the same thoughts too.”
 This was just how difficult it was to walk the immortal path.
 As for those who could truly enter the Mystic Immortal Realm and the Ancestral Immortal Realm, they were all absolute geniuses. They were full of willpower and tenacity, removing from themselves the shortcomings of ordinary people.
 Their goal was to advance with all their might.
 Hence, they were in great pain.
 Lin Jiufeng then carefully read the cultivation insights of a few more Mystic Immortals and Ancestral Immortals.
 The general situation was the same. After introducing the difficulties in these realms, they lamented how rugged and difficult the path of an immortal was.
 To Lin Jiufeng, these insights had broadened his horizons and also cast a shadow in his heart.
 The path of an immortal was so difficult.
 Could he break through to the realm that he wanted in 50 years?
 At 10 am, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of Lin Jiufeng’s eyes.
 [Sign-In in the Sea of Books?]
 Lin Jiufeng put down the book in his hand and said softly, “Sign in!”
 Another new day arrived. Early in the morning, Lin Jiufeng received a new sign-in opportunity.
 [Sign-In successful. Received Nine Pure Immortal Lights!]
 Lin Jiufeng was stunned. What were these Nine Pure Immortal Lights?
 From the name, it was probably an immortal technique. But he didn’t know anything else.
 Lin Jiufeng quickly checked the information of the Nine Pure Immortal Lights.
 [The Nine Pure Immortal Lights are divided into nine immortal lights: Shangqing, Yuqing, Taiqing, Lingqing, Yuanqing, Xuqing, Huaqing, Muqing, and Zhiqing. Each of these nine immortal lights has invincible might. They can wipe out heaven and earth, divide the filth from the clean, settle down the vital energy of the land, and open up the space of chaos. Once this technique is truly executed, all evil will not be able to invade the user. If a Perfected Immortal falls into the light, they will all turn into dust and clear water, dying on the spot.]
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the words on the message and was overjoyed. This was an extremely powerful and terrifying immortal technique.
 He had never signed in for such a terrifying immortal technique before.
 Now that he had it, he naturally couldn’t wait to start cultivating.
 The Nine Pure Immortal Lights instantly transformed into a stream of light that entered Lin Jiufeng’s body. The foul air instantly sank, and the clear air rose. Nine supreme immortal energies were born in his body.
 Primordial chaos entangled his body. Nine great immortal energies hid within, unmoving like a mountain.
 But once they moved, each of them had invincible might. They could destroy everything and kill the enemy on the spot.
 “I finally have a trump card that can protect my life,” Lin Jiufeng said with a smile.
 After learning the Nine Pure Immortal Lights, Lin Jiufeng’s realm actually quietly advanced a step forward and arrived at the eighth step of the Nine Restrictions.
 “If only I could sign in to such an immortal technique or treasure every time and improve my cultivation base. That way, I wouldn’t have to worry about the troubles that will come in the future,” Lin Jiufeng lamented.
 Compared to the number of treasures he could sign in, the chances of him signing in for immortal techniques or treasures that could improve his strength were too small.
 Hence, Lin Jiufeng couldn’t place all his hope on this. He had to find other ways to improve himself.
 For the latter half of the night, Lin Jiufeng continued to study the Nine Pure Immortal Lights until daybreak. By then, he was well-versed in it and could execute it with a raise of his hand. It was extremely powerful.
 In the morning, Lin Jiufeng took out the General Appointing Platform and placed it in the Sea of Books. Then, he activated the General Appointing Platform.
 Rumble!
 The entire Sea of Books trembled.
 In the distance, Miss Hong raised her head. She put down the books in her hand and looked at the countless books around her that were being absorbed by the General Appointing Platform.
 The General Appointing Platform hovered in the air and began to frantically absorb the books in the Sea of Books.
 The commotion wasn’t small, and it attracted the descendants of the God Race in the Third World.
 They stood together with White Dragon.
 “You gave the Sea of Books to someone else just like that?” A thin-faced old man asked White Dragon.
 “So instead of letting him bring the books out and be of use to the world, we should keep the Sea of Books here and wait for it to be destroyed?” White Dragon asked.
 The thin-faced old man was speechless.
 “It’s a pity. The fate of us people has long been destined. It’s just that I wonder if we can die in the end in a more glorious and dignified manner,” a young woman said regretfully.
 “Actually, it’s not a pity. That’s the female War God reputed to be the strongest in the history of the Immortal Court. Even the leader of our God Race had to lure her here to lie in ambush. Such a powerful existence has been suppressed by us for 20,000 years. It’s very meaningful to think about it.” An old man with a brandy nose chuckled.
 The others also felt better upon hearing this.
 “The only pity is that the bloodline of the God Race will be broken in our hands,” White Dragon said regretfully.
 “Every race has its own historical responsibility. Our God Race is in charge of ending the Immortal Court. It’s not a pity because we managed to achieve our goal. If our bloodline is broken, so be it. Countless races have perished in history. Perhaps in the future, our God Race will rise from the dead.” The thin-faced old man comforted White Dragon.
 “Now that the Sea of Books has been handed to him, it’s equivalent to handing the burden of our history to him. I wonder if he can withstand it and hand over a satisfying answer?” White Dragon looked at Lin Jiufeng, his eyes filled with anticipation.

                    



 Chapter 312: Welcome Home  
 The General Appointing Platform quickly gathered the books in the Sea of Books into its gigantic interior space. Its interior space was very huge, able to store the huge Sea of Books.
 ‘Millions of gods and demons as generals, billions of living beings as soldiers.’ An item described in such a way was naturally no ordinary thing.
 After storing the Sea of Books, Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong came out.
 They saw the descendants of the God Race.
 More than 90 descendants of the God Race were gathered here.
 They looked at Lin Jiufeng and Miss Hong with complicated looks in their eyes.
 The Sea of Books that they had protected for 20,000 years was now taken away by Lin Jiufeng.
 Although they had convinced themselves in their hearts that letting the Sea of Books be brought out was the best choice now, when they really saw Lin Jiufeng walking out with the General Appointing Platform, their mood was still very complicated.
 White Dragon smiled and said, “Now that you have the Sea of Books, are you going out?”
 Lin Jiufeng nodded. He bowed to these descendants of the God Race and said sincerely, “Thank you all for sacrificing your lives and spending your entire lives to suppress the female War God of the Immortal Court. I will bring the Sea of Books out and spread it throughout the world, letting the people of the world know of this piece of history. I will not let you all be drowned in the dust of history.”
 Lin Jiufeng’s actions made the group of descendants feel a little embarrassed.
 With White Dragon as the leader, they bowed to Lin Jiufeng in return.
 “The God Race and the Immortal Court are irreconcilable. Back then, the ancestors fought a bloody battle. Now, us descendants haven’t tarnished their reputation. But in the future, we still need you to deal with the Immortal Court’s female War God. We will do our best to stall for 50 years,” White Dragon said.
 Lin Jiufeng nodded and smiled slightly. His smile was warm and full of strength as he said, “I’ve always been protecting the world and the mortal realm, and I’ll continue to do so in the future.”
 The people of the God Race watched as Lin Jiufeng left. They had nothing to say anymore. Seeing the Sea of Books being brought out and going to become of great use to the world, they were already very satisfied.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t say anything more. They all understood each other without the use of words. If this group of descendants of the God Race had other intentions, they could have long left the Third World and gone to the First World to show their might to the world. After all, they were much stronger than the immortals in the First World now.
 But unbeknownst to the world, they still guarded the Third World and suppressed the Immortal Court War God.
 Lin Jiufeng admired this willpower and effort.
 The only thing he could do was to stop the outbreak of the Immortal Court War God 50 years later.
 …
 After leaving the Third World and standing in the Hengduan Mountain Range, Lin Jiufeng felt like he had spent a lifetime there.
 It turned out that the Immortal Court and the God Race, which he thought had long been drowned in the dust of history, actually still existed. Moreover, there were other worlds outside this world.
 The First World was the main world and was unscathed.
 The Third World was destroyed by the female War God of the Immortal Court. Until now, only a small portion of the world was stable, and the rest had already become chaotic.
 Lin Jiufeng was glad that he had come here and personally witnessed the descendant of the God Race and the Immortal Court War God who only existed in the legends.
 If he didn’t come here and spent 50 years in the outside world leisurely, when the female War God recovered, the harmony that this era had painstakingly welcomed would instantly collapse.
 This was absolutely unacceptable for Lin Jiufeng.
 Standing in the Hengduan Mountain Range, looking into the northwest, it was the Western Desert with unpredictable climate changes, the birthplace of Buddhism.
 Lin Jiufeng watched carefully. He still remembered that White Dragon had said that the Western Desert had a terrifying power hidden there. The Buddhist sects of the Western Desert were also worthy of him taking a look.
 “I’ll go back and put the Sea of Books down first before going to the Western Desert.” Lin Jiufeng made the necessary arrangements.
 He would handle this step by step.
 He still had 50 years.
 These 50 years weren’t considered short or long, but it was enough for him to do many things.
 “Miss Hong, let me send you back to the Northwest Territory,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 Miss Hong’s injuries had yet to recover, so Lin Jiufeng wanted to ensure her safety.
 “No need. I’m almost healed. Moreover, I don’t want to return to the Northwest Territory. I want to go somewhere else.” Miss Hong shook her head and rejected Lin Jiufeng.
 “You can’t use your powers now, you should go back and recuperate,” Lin Jiufeng advised.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, you’re not the only one who’s worried about the Immortal Court War God, I’m worried too. I’m going to improve myself. See you in 50 years.” Miss Hong rejected Lin Jiufeng again. Then, with a beautiful smile, she turned around and left chicly.
 Miss Hong’s graceful figure disappeared before Lin Jiufeng’s eyes. She slowly released her power, not worried about her injuries at all.
 She wanted to comprehend the insights of the Universe Clock that Elder Universe gave her. 50 years later, she would appear again.
 “This is what the people of the Heavenly Dao Sect should do!”
 “The female War God of the Immortal Court sounds domineering. If I defeat her, wouldn’t that make me even more domineering than her?” The corner of Miss Hong’s mouth curled up. She liked this feeling.
 Watching Miss Hong leave, Lin Jiufeng didn’t persuade her anymore. He directly returned to the Martial Temple base camp of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 As the era passed, the Martial Temple’s base camp continued to expand. It was constantly being built and spread in all directions. A mountain range wasn’t enough, and it was expanded beyond the mountain range with a radius of 1,000 miles.
 A large city that was even more prosperous, magnificent, and beautiful than the imperial capital was built.
 The most outstanding geniuses of the world were gathered here, and this was also the peak Martial Temple that countless people yearned for.
 When Lin Jiufeng arrived, what he saw were countless energetic youths. Their faces were young, but their cultivation bases were all extremely powerful.
 Lin Jiufeng looked ordinary as he walked in this new city. No one who passed by him noticed him.
 The Martial Temple had now changed to a new Mountain Leader. It was Zhou Qing and Zuo Muyun. Emperor De had also issued an order for this. They took over the Martial Temple and began a new round of changes.
 The rules set by the Martial Temples back then were no longer useful. After all, many students had already broken through to the Immortal Realm. They had to follow the new era and develop new rules that conformed to the current situation.
 For this reason, Zuo Muyun and Zhou Qing did their best to gather a large group of immortals. After a period of intense discussion, they finally decided on the new rules and regulations.
 The Martial Temple officially started the stage of immortals being the teachers.
 In other words, in this peak Martial Temple, the teachers were all immortals.
 Those who weren’t immortals were called teaching assistants, meaning they were assistants to the Immortal Realm teachers.
 As for those immortals registered with the Yuhua God Dynasty, they had to come to the Martial Temple every six months to teach for half a month.
 This was to broaden the horizons of the students of the Martial Temple.
 While being trained in the ways of cultivation, the cultural lessons of the students didn’t stop too. The culture lessons taught the children how to love their country, their families, and themselves.
 The education on ideals and morals was proposed by Lin Jiufeng back then. He didn’t want the students taught by the Martial Temple to ultimately rebel against the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 A school that only imparted strength, not thoughts and morals would definitely harm others and themselves.
 Lin Jiufeng walked past the crowd, the heavily guarded door, the interior of the Martial Temple, and saw Zuo Muyun and Zhou Qing.
 The two of them were now dressed like scholars, perfectly blending into their current roles.
 When they saw Lin Jiufeng, they were delighted.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, why have you come?” Zhou Qing asked curiously.
 “I’m here to deliver books to you,” Lin Jiufeng said with a smile.
 “Deliver books?” Zuo Muyun looked at Lin Jiufeng, puzzled.
 “I took a look at the books in the Martial Temple. It can be said that the Martial Temple has collected all the books in the world. Moreover, some of the isolated books have always been saved, printed, and re-produced. Then, they were spread all over the world. It can be said that there is no other place in the world that contains more books than the Martial Temple,” Zhou Qing said proudly.
 He was now one of the Mountain Leaders of the Martial Temple, so he naturally paid a lot of attention to the Martial Temple. Everything he did now revolved around the Martial Temple.
 It was the same for Zuo Muyun. When it came to the books in the Martial Temple, he was very confident.
 Lin Jiufeng smiled and said, “The books that I brought this time will drown the Martial Temple. It will broaden your horizons. I need a large open space.”
 “There’s a wide and open place here. We’ve just hollowed out this huge mountain range. The interior is like a huge underground castle that’s thousands of miles long. Is that enough?” Zhou Qing asked.
 Lin Jiufeng pondered for a while. “Just barely. It’s enough if the books are more compactly placed.”
 Zuo Muyun and Zhou Qing were shocked. How many books were there? Such a huge space was barely enough?
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t say anything more. He let them lead the way to the huge underground castle and released the Sea of Books that he had brought from the Third World.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 The Sea of Books was put down with a huge commotion, broadening Zuo Muyun and Zhou Qing’s horizons.
 “These books are all books that were previously lost in history?” Zhou Qing picked up one and carefully read through it as he asked excitedly.
 Because he discovered that the words and things recorded in these books came from 20,000 years ago.
 This discovery excited him.
 Then, looking at the huge Sea of Books, his entire body trembled.
 He was trembling in excitement.
 Zuo Muyun was no exception. He was also very excited. “Great Emperor Jiufeng, where did you find these books?”
 Zhou Qing also looked at Lin Jiufeng curiously.
 “I obtained them from the descendants of the God Race. Your current mission is to carefully study the sea of books here and then publicize the stories buried in history so that the people of the world will know what happened in the past and why we have the current situation. Tell the people of the world not to forget those glorious races in the past,” Lin Jiufeng said solemnly.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, rest assured. I will do as you ask.” Zuo Muyun nodded.
 “There are also many lost immortal techniques here. Let the students of the Martial Temple look for them themselves. These mystic techniques are the hard work of the predecessors, they shouldn’t have been lost just like that. After the students learn them, they can continue to develop on the foundation techniques of the predecessors. It’s what this generation of people should do.” Lin Jiufeng continued.
 Zhou Qing and Zuo Muyun listened attentively.
 They were convinced of Lin Jiufeng from the bottom of their hearts.
 Especially when there were so many immortal spells and so many precious books among these books, but he placed them here just like that for the children of the common people to read.
 It was worthy of admiration.
 Not only was Lin Jiufeng very powerful, but he was also very loving and good to the people of the world.
 “There are some lone books here, you guys have to protect them seriously and make new copies of them. But you also have to keep what the predecessors wrote well and let our descendants know what inheritance is.” Lin Jiufeng continued to remind them.
 “Don’t worry, we will do all of these,” Zuo Muyun said confidently.
 “That’s good. Since you guys can do this, I shall leave first. Groom more geniuses and treat them all equally, understand?” Lin Jiufeng reminded them before he left.
 Zuo Muyun and Zhou Qing looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.
 “As expected of Great Emperor Jiufeng. These books are comparable to the sea. There are books as far as the eye can see. Even so, he can bring all of them here,” Zhou Qing said.
 “The key is that he took them all out and let the students read them for free. He even let the young people inherit and learn from them. His broad-mindedness is worthy of us learning from him,” Zuo Muyun said.
 “We need to build a huge library here so that the students can come in and learn. We also have to protect the lone books. It will take a lot of work.” Zhou Qing shook his head and said with a happy smile.
 “We’re going to be busy now. But thinking of how we can unveil the fog of history and place a real story of the past in front of the people of the world, I’m full of energy now,” Zuo Muyun said excitedly.
 Zhou Qing laughed and got busy.
 …
 Lin Jiufeng left the Martial Temple and stood on the peak of a huge mountain. In front of him was the imperial capital.
 The imperial capital was still the same as before. Looking from afar, it was very astonishing, especially when looking from a height. Inside the imperial capital, there were millions of people living there. It was the political center of the Yuhua God Dynasty.
 But to be honest, 100 years ago, this was the political center and the geographic location was also very good.
 But now, with the territory of the Yuhua God Dynasty constantly expanding and could be said to be a huge landmass, the location of the imperial capital was very remote.
 Especially when there were several mountains around the imperial capital.
 More importantly, the imperial capital had always been close to the Martial Temple’s base camp.
 Lin Jiufeng felt that this wasn’t a good idea.
 The current Martial Temple was too close to the political center. If anything happened, the two most important places of the Yuhua God Dynasty would suffer together.
 Hence, they had to split up.
 Lin Jiufeng murmured, “It’s time to move the imperial capital.”
 But this couldn’t be done too hastily. There were millions of people inside, moving the imperial capital wasn’t a simple thing.
 Lin Jiufeng watched for a while before he returned to the imperial capital and entered the Cold Palace.
 In the heavily guarded imperial capital, Lin Jiufeng easily entered. No one discovered him.
 In front of the Cold Palace, the [Light of the Homes] swayed slightly when it saw Lin Jiufeng’s return.
 The center of the flame became even more intense, bringing with it a bright light that shone in all directions.
 It had become even stronger.
 Compared to its previous display of power, the current [Light of the Homes] had become more restrained.
 But it was really very powerful.
 Lin Jiufeng just watched. The man and the lamp stood in front of the Cold Palace. Their auras clashed within a radius of 30 feet, but they didn’t spread out.
 Under the pressure of the [Light of the Homes], Lin Jiufeng frowned slightly. It was too powerful and terrifying.
 Lin Jiufeng was forced to use all his strength.
 But the [Light of the Homes] didn’t even go all out yet.
 Because no one came to activate it. It was displaying its might based on its own instincts.
 After a while, Lin Jiufeng gave up. He was no match for the [Light of the Homes].
 Looking at the [Light of the Homes], Lin Jiufeng rejoiced in his heart. Fortunately, this was his treasure.
 But Lin Jiufeng didn’t expect this treasure of his to evolve faster than him.
 “Evolve as early as you can and develop a spirit of our own. Then, you will be able to think and act on your own. Only then will you be truly powerful,” Lin Jiufeng said to the [Light of the Homes].
 The [Light of the Homes] swayed for a while, the flames danced a few times, then returned to silence.
 At this moment, the door of the Cold Palace was opened. A flower of the mortal realm appeared. When her beautiful white face saw Lin Jiufeng, she revealed a happy expression.
 “Welcome home!” Bai Mao’er said with a smile.

                    



 Chapter 313: Reincarnation and Rebirth  
 Home. Lin Jiufeng had never experienced this word before. It wasn’t until he met the little white cat that he finally had a home.
 In the past, Lin Jiufeng treated the little white cat as his pet, so he didn’t have any other thoughts.
 But after the little white cat transformed and they truly became husband and wife, this feeling was incomparably intense.
 He had a home now.
 There was someone at home who missed him.
 This ordinary warmth made Lin Jiufeng cherish it even more.
 He reached out and hugged Bai Mao’er. He leaned against her and his heart calmed down. No matter what happened next, he would be able to face it calmly.
 “I missed you, so I came back.” Lin Jiufeng gently cupped Bai Mao’er’s face and kissed her.
 “I don’t believe you.” Bai Mao’er shook her head flirtatiously. Her eyes darted around, luring the primitive feelings in Lin Jiufeng’s heart.
 Lin Jiufeng carried her up and strode into the Cold Palace. The door closed with a bang.
 “I will let you know how much I miss you now,” Lin Jiufeng said firmly.
 Bai Mao’er hugged Lin Jiufeng’s neck and said softly, “Then, let me see how powerful Great Emperor Jiufeng is. I’m not convinced.”
 Her breathing was sweet and her red lips were fiery, causing Lin Jiufeng to stop in his tracks.
 Uh…
 Bai Mao’er was unable to talk anymore.
 Lin Jiufeng pushed her into the room.
 …
 The flute sounded, the jade pot shone, and the fish and dragon danced throughout the night.
 Lin Jiufeng and Bai Mao’er lived intimately for three days. He didn’t go out of the Cold Palace at all, relieving their pain of longing for each other.
 But in the past three days, the outside world had been in an uproar.
 Because the Martial Temple released a piece of heavy news that shocked everyone in the world.
 The Martial Temple obtained countless books, immortal spells, and the truth hidden by history.
 Each of these things was shocking.
 Now that they were placed together, how could the people of the world not be excited?
 It turned out that 20,000 years ago, there was still an Immortal Court in this world.
 It turned out that the Immortal Court had a terrifying opponent called the God Race.
 It turned out that a huge battle broke out between the God Race and the Immortal Court, causing both sides to disappear into the long river of history.
 Other than that, many top powerhouses and peerless talents were also revealed by the Martial Temple.
 The Human Race was excited.
 The Myriad Races were also excited.
 Now, countless people had come to the Martial Temple, hoping to see these books.
 The Martial Temple wasn’t courteous either. They set some rules. Outsiders could read the books, but they had to either become teachers in the Martial Temple or pass down their legacy. If they chose the second option, they had to choose two students in the Martial Temple as disciples and teach them.
 These policies made a large group of immortals curse endlessly.
 But they had no choice. They really wanted to read and know what had happened in the past.
 Hence, in just three days, the Martial Temple gained thousands of teachers. There were also tens of thousands of students who were accepted as disciples by the immortals.
 This number was still increasing.
 The outside world was in a flurry of discussion.
 Regarding the Immortal Court, the God Race, the Martial Temple, and finally the Yuhua God Dynasty…
 These discussions caused the story of the God Race to quickly spread throughout the world.
 The Martial Temple had also become a place that everyone yearned for.
 …
 Deep in the mountains of the Martial Temple, various books were placed in the hollowed-out place. The teachers of the Martial Temple were tidying them.
 Among them, there were also students reading the books with full attention.
 These were basically outstanding students from the Martial Temple.
 Among these students, there was a quiet and taciturn student with a heaven-defying talent who was currently distancing himself from the crowd and reading a book of the God Race.
 He read very meticulously.
 This book recorded the battles between the God Race and the Immortal Court. It was written very excitingly, and the battles were also very intense.
 Of course, the final victory belonged to the God Race.
 The more the young man read, the more he frowned.
 “What bullsh*t!” The young man couldn’t stand it anymore. He threw the book aside angrily.
 “The God Race can’t destroy the Immortal Court at all. Although the main force of the Immortal Court perished with the God Race, the capital of the Immortal Court is too abundant. Therefore, after the main force of the Immortal Court perished with the God Race, the Immortal Court continued to exist.” The young man snorted coldly. He was very angry.
 “If it weren’t for that damn Elder Universe perishing together with the Immortal Court, how could it be possible for the Human Race to rule the world now?” The young man gritted his teeth and said.
 Compared to the God Race, he actually hated Elder Universe more.
 “Back then, 20,000 years ago, I was just a foot soldier in the Immortal Court. I couldn’t participate in the war between the God Race and Immortal Court at all. I should have been safe and sound, but when Elder Universe came and destroyed the last bit of power of the Immortal Court, I was also killed.”
 “Fortunately, after I died, my soul was saved by the Immortal Court’s supreme treasure, the Eternal Dragon Boat, and I’ve been floating in the long river of time. It wasn’t until 20 years ago that I was reincarnated and was born in this world. In the past, my divine soul hadn’t awakened, and I was just living in a blur. But now, I’ve already awakened. I won’t allow anyone to malign the Immortal Court wantonly. I have to find the seniors of the former Immortal Court to uphold justice and rebuild the Immortal Court.”
 “This era is the best era.”
 The young man was shy, silent, and not good with words previously. But now, these traits were all gone.
 He became extremely confident in himself.
 After experiencing so many things, one would naturally become more at ease in life.
 “The heavens gave me a second chance. In my previous life, I was just a small soldier in the Immortal Court, a peripheral figure. I was casually swept by the residual energy of Elder Universe and died on the spot.”
 “But I swear that I will definitely rise up in this life. I want to be the foundation of the Immortal Court. I want to establish a new Immortal Court in this era.”
 “Be it the Human Race or the Myriad Races, they must submit to the majesty of the Immortal Court.”
 “But with my current strength, I can’t do this. I need help. The Immortal Court once enshrined two injured seniors of the Immortal Court in the Buddhist sects of the Western Desert. I have the Eternal Dragon Boat that can treat or wake them up. This way, I will have helpers. The first step of reviving the Immortal Court is to go to the Western Desert!” The young man was excited. He wanted to go to the Western Desert to wake up the former seniors of the Immortal Court and conquer the world.
 “What bullsh*t Great Emperor Jiufeng? In front of the seniors of my Immortal Court, he can be destroyed with a flick of his finger. The foundation of the Yuhua God Dynasty is ours to take. On the foundation of your Yuhua God Dynasty, we will bring it to greater heights. Just wait for the Immortal Court to come into being.” The young man’s heart rippled violently. He looked at the books around him in disgust.
 They were all trash, their evaluation of the Immortal Court wasn’t fair at all.
 The Immortal Court should be high and mighty, sacred and noble.
 He looked down on the teachers here crazily in his heart, but he still bade farewell to them very politely.
 He wanted to go back to his hometown.
 His hometown was in the Western Desert.
 Right where the Buddhist temples were prevalent.
 Just as he was quietly leaving the Martial Temple, a man walked out of the Cold Palace in the imperial capital.
 It was Lin Jiufeng!
 He had accompanied Bai Mao’er for three days. Now, he wanted to go to the Western Desert and investigate carefully.

                    



 Chapter 314: Monk Crescent  The Western Desert was located far away from the Hengduan Mountain Range. It was far away from the Central Plains and had a special culture. It was the source of Buddhism.
 The biggest sect in the Western Desert was Buddhism, but there were also different branches of Buddhism.
 On the way to the Western Desert, Lin Jiufeng had carefully studied that area.
 The biggest Buddhist sect in the Western Desert was the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 The sect was in the depths of the Western Desert, in the core area. But they were very low-key. They were only a little famous in the Western Desert. In the Central Plains, very few people knew about them.
 If it weren’t for White Dragon telling Lin Jiufeng that a Great Emperor Shakyamuni had once appeared in the Western Desert, he wouldn’t have noticed this piece of land at all.
 “In the past, I placed my sights on the Central Plains, the Northwest Territory, and the Hundred Thousand Mountains. I haven’t paid attention to a large piece of land like the Western Desert. This really shouldn’t be the case.” Lin Jiufeng arrived at the Hengduan Mountain Range and stood at the entrance of the Third World. He looked ahead at the vast world that stretched as far as the eye could see.
 The Western Desert!
 “Do you want to Sign-In at the Hengduan Mountain Range?”
 Just as Lin Jiufeng was about to move, a line of words appeared before his eyes.
 He blinked and immediately said, “Sign in!”
 “Sign-In successful. Received the Hengduan Sword!”
 This was a very long sword, with a strange sword hilt that resembled a mountain.
 The sword was thin and sharp. When slashed horizontally, it was as if it could cut through space.
 “What grade is this sword at?” Lin Jiufeng held the sword in his hand. The feeling of the sword felt good, but he still needed to check the information.
 [Hengduan Sword, supreme-grade immortal artifact, excels in attacking power and explosive power!]
 This introduction made Lin Jiufeng smile.
 “A supreme-grade immortal artifact. Not bad, not bad. This can be considered my third strongest magic treasure.” Lin Jiufeng looked at the Hengduan Sword in satisfaction.
 Needless to say, his strongest magic treasure was the [Light of the Homes].
 The second strongest magic treasure was the General Appointing Platform.
 Then, Lin Jiufeng no longer had any other magic treasures.
 He gave his sword case to Princess Yulin, along with all the swords in the sword case.
 After that, Lin Jiufeng no longer had a weapon in hand. He only brought the General Appointing Platform along with him.
 Now that he had signed in this Hengduan Sword, Lin Jiufeng didn’t have to smash out the General Appointing Platform whenever he wanted to fight.
 After casually gaining control of it and integrating it into his body, Lin Jiufeng crossed the Hengduan Mountain Range and stepped into the land of the Western Desert.
 The first time Lin Jiufeng stepped into the Western Desert, he felt that it was completely different from the Central Plains and the Northwest Territory.
 The land of the Western Desert and the air of the Western Desert seemed to be chanting in Sanskrit.
 Lin Jiufeng quickly walked deeper into the vast land. He crossed the mountains and rivers. What he saw and heard were all strange sights that were different from the Central Plains.
 Everything around him carried a sense of beauty.
 When Lin Jiufeng saw the natives, they dressed differently from the people of the Central Plains. They looked exotic.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t chat with them. He just advanced silently. The places and people he saw along the way gave him a refreshing feeling.
 On this day, Lin Jiufeng went deep into the land of the Western Desert for 10,000 miles. Even so, this speed was only because he wasn’t in a hurry to leap over the mountains and the river valleys.
 At night, Lin Jiufeng saw the first temple in the Western Desert.
 That’s right. Not only was the Western Desert and the Central Plains separated by a mountain range, but there was also a buffer zone of 10,000 miles between them.
 In this area of 10,000 miles, there wasn’t a single temple. There were even very few people.
 But after crossing this 10,000 miles, one could see that the number of temples and monks increased greatly.
 There were many ascetics in the Buddhist sects of the Western Desert.
 Lin Jiufeng was also advancing at night. He saw quite a lot of scenes.
 These monks abandoned everything on the surface. Living in luxury, living a prosperous life, and the desires of the secular world were all regarded as the foundation of their mental demons to seduce people into falling.
 Only by overcoming all these could one ultimately reach the realm of Buddha.
 At night, Lin Jiufeng encountered an ascetic monk. He kowtowed every three steps and bowed deeply every nine steps.
 This person was a False Immortal. Among those of the False Immortal Realm, he was very powerful.
 But he was still so pious. Like an ordinary person, he followed the thoughts in his heart.
 Lin Jiufeng was greatly shocked. Taking advantage of the latter’s rest in the night, he also stopped to communicate with the other party.
 “Why do you insist on kowtowing every three steps and bowing every nine steps?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 The monk was an ascetic, dark and thin. The clothes he wore were patched up, and he looked travel-weary, like a homeless man.
 But his eyes were so pure, like a child’s or like the stars in the night sky. They were very pure.
 Lin Jiufeng swore that he had seen many people in his life, but he had never seen such a pure gaze in the eyes of adults.
 He had only seen it on children before.
 This kind of purity wasn’t naivety. It wasn’t that he didn’t understand anything, but it was a kind of tolerance and curiosity. It was a special feeling.
 Even though he had already seen the world, he was still very curious about it.
 This curiosity was akin to a baby seeing the world for the first time.
 Lin Jiufeng saw these special feelings in this ascetic monk.
 “Patron, are you from the Central Plains?” The ascetic monk asked calmly.
 Lin Jiufeng nodded and continued to look at the monk.
 He was waiting for the answer to that question.
 The ascetic monk smiled and said, “Some people in this world do smart things, and naturally, there are also people who do foolish things.”
 “A lot of people are fighting to do smart things. I can’t win against others, so I can only do something foolish,” the ascetic replied.
 “But what exactly is a smart thing and what is a foolish thing?” Lin Jiufeng asked with a frown.
 “Something that is advantageous is a smart thing. Something with no benefits to be gained, but instead, one has to pay a lot of things to do this thing, is a foolish thing.” The monk explained.
 Lin Jiufeng fell silent.
 This ascetic in front of him was doing a foolish thing.
 He kowtowed every three steps and bowed every nine steps. He didn’t obtain anything substantial.
 But it could put him at ease.
 Being at ease was actually very important.
 “Where are you going, Bhante?” Lin Jiufeng asked again after a short silence.
 “Great Thunderclap Temple!” The monk replied.
 Lin Jiufeng’s eyes lit up. Great Thunderclap Temple was also his target for this trip.
 “How far are you from the Great Thunderclap Temple now?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “According to my current speed, I can reach there in half a year.” The monk calculated and answered Lin Jiufeng.
 “Is there a real Buddha in the Great Thunderclap Temple?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 “The real Buddha is in the hearts of everyone. As long as the Inner Ape is tamed, all living beings will be Buddha. There is no Buddha in the Great Thunderclap Temple,” the ascetic monk replied.
 “By that, you mean that even the monks of Great Thunderclap Temple are unable to subdue their Inner Apes?” Lin Jiufeng asked with a frown.
 “The monks of Great Thunderclap Monastery are also humans. They also have mental demons and thoughts of anger. Buddha isn’t that easy to be born into.” The monk explained.
 “Then, one last question. Is Great Emperor Shakyamuni in the Great Thunderclap Temple?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 The ascetic monk was dazed. Then, he shook his head and laughed. “If you want to look for Emperor Shakyamuni, you have to go to 100,000 years ago. He should still be around then.”
 Lin Jiufeng also smiled. He knew that this question of his was a little stupid, but he didn’t mind. Instead, he said, “Then the question just now doesn’t count. This is the last one. How should I address you?”
 The monk looked at the moonlight and said, “You can call me Crescent!”
 It was only at this moment that Lin Jiufeng realized that he wasn’t old.
 He should be very young.
 About 18 years old, but his cultivation base was at the peak of the False Immortal Realm. He wasn’t far from becoming an immortal.
 “Monk Crescent, let’s meet again in the future. Thank you for answering my questions.” Lin Jiufeng waved his hand and turned to leave.
 “Patron, you know my Dharma name, but I don’t know what your name is. Since you are thanking me, then tell me your name,” said Monk Crescent with a smile.
 Lin Jiufeng turned around and looked at the dark and thin monk. The corner of his mouth curled up as he said, “The people of the world call me… Great Emperor Jiufeng!”
 With that, Lin Jiufeng disappeared without a trace this time and went deep into the Western Desert.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, the Son of Destiny of this era?” Monk Crescent looked at the place where Lin Jiufeng disappeared and murmured.
 The aura on his body began to fluctuate. He directly broke through from the peak of the False Immortal Realm to the Immortal Realm, and it was still continuing to rise.
 Until in the end, his aura fell again.
 Then, Monk Crescent followed his heart. He kowtowed every three steps and bowed every nine steps, heading for the Great Thunderclap Temple.

                    



 Chapter 315: Perfected Immortal Seed  After bidding farewell to Monk Crescent, Lin Jiufeng directly headed for the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 In the vastness of the Western Desert, the most important was still the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 According to the rumors, the legacy of Great Thunderclap Temple had yet to end. It had always kept a low profile. Although it was the orthodox sect of the Buddhist sects, it wasn’t famous in history.
 If it weren’t for Lin Jiufeng’s careful investigation, there would really be no news at all.
 On the way there, Lin Jiufeng saw many ascetics, all of whom were paying religious homage to the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 The faces of the ascetics looked sallow. They were dirty from the sun and wind. But their hearts were very pure.
 Without being disturbed by external things, they focused on doing what they wanted to do.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t continue to inquire with them. He followed the ascetic’s footsteps and crossed the Western Desert to the front of Great Thunderclap Temple.
 The Great Thunderclap Temple wasn’t as vast and majestic as Lin Jiufeng thought.
 The Great Thunderclap Temple in front of him was a slightly dilapidated ancient city. In the center of the ancient city was the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 The incense offerings were endless.
 Around the ancient city, pious believers knelt on the ground and worshipped this ancient city, seeking the comfort of the soul.
 Lin Jiufeng reached the Great Thunderclap Temple just like that.
 “This is an ancient faction that had been passed down for 100,000 years?” Lin Jiufeng frowned. He couldn’t figure it out.
 No matter how he looked at it, it didn’t look like it.
 Hence, he walked towards the ancient city.
 Unlike the ascetics worshiping around him, Lin Jiufeng seemed out of place and very conspicuous.
 In the Great Thunderclap Temple, two terrifying lights shot out from the eyes of a young man. They were extremely resplendent, like two divine lights that pierced through the sky.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng!”
 The young man recognized Lin Jiufeng. He came from the Martial Temple.
 Lin Jiufeng was the previous Mountain Leader of the Martial Temple. His statue was even placed in front of the Martial Temple by Emperor De.
 In addition, when the Myriad Races appeared later on, Lin Jiufeng suppressed them. Therefore, everyone knew about his appearance.
 The young man instantly recognized Lin Jiufeng.
 He was furious.
 “You are the one who brought out those rebellious God Race books and even spread them throughout the world to slander my Immortal Court!”
 The young man gnashed his teeth in anger.
 His expression was gloomy. His hands clenched into fists. He hated this number one person in the world, the number one immortal in the world, the praised Great Emperor Jiufeng.
 But he didn’t act rashly.
 Instead, he turned around silently and retracted his angry gaze, not wanting to be discovered by Lin Jiufeng.
 “I’ll go find someone!” The young man turned around and left. He wasn’t a young and immature man. Although he looked young on the outside, he was from the Immortal Court back then.
 He knew that it would be difficult for him to deal with Lin Jiufeng on his own now, but he had his ways.
 The current Great Thunderclap Temple wasn’t the Great Thunderclap Temple from 100,000 years ago.
 But what he didn’t know was that Lin Jiufeng directly caught his glance.
 Lin Jiufeng frowned as he looked at the Great Thunderclap Temple. He had noticed that resentful gaze just now.
 “This is my first time in the Great Thunderclap Temple and I didn’t offend anyone. Who has such great hatred for me?” Lin Jiufeng was puzzled.
 He looked around. The hatred was now gone.
 But that didn’t mean that Lin Jiufeng would let down his guard.
 He slowly stepped into the ancient city of Great Thunderclap Temple.
 [Do you want to Sign-In before the Great Thunderclap Temple (Fake)?]
 This notification shocked Lin Jiufeng.
 Was this Great Thunderclap Temple actually fake?
 The key was that even though it was fake, Lin Jiufeng could still sign in from it.
 He agreed without hesitation.
 [Sign-In successful. Received a Perfected Immortal Seed!]
 “What is this?” A crystal-like seed appeared in Lin Jiufeng’s palm as he curiously checked the information.
 [The Perfected Immortal Seed is an opportunity to break through to the Perfected Immortal Realm. Planting a Perfected Immortal Seed will result in the nomological powers of the Perfected Immortal Realm being harvested. The number of nomological powers harvested will depend on how you water the Perfected Immortal Seed.]
 This information made Lin Jiufeng’s eyes light up. It was indeed not bad.
 This would be his treasure to break through to the Perfected Immortal Realm.
 Without hesitation, Lin Jiufeng put away the Perfected Immortal Seed and waited for the chance to plant it.
 Then, he looked at this ancient city and the Great Thunderclap Temple in the ancient city and frowned.
 How was this fake?
 The Buddhist charm, the Dao charm, and the ancient aura in this Great Thunderclap Temple weren’t fake.
 “In other words, this fake Great Thunderclap Temple has existed for a very, very long time. That’s why it has such a thick Dao charm and Buddhist charm, to the point that even a true eminent monk wouldn’t be able to discover it.” Lin Jiufeng looked around solemnly.
 Suddenly, he realized that the door of the Great Thunderclap Temple had opened.
 An old monk walked out from inside.
 This was a thin, emaciated old monk. He wore a kasaya and had a hunchback, looking like a monkey wearing clothes.
 He walked straight towards Lin Jiufeng.
 When he got close, he smiled at Lin Jiufeng. He pressed his palms together and held the Buddha beads in his palms.
 This string of Buddha beads weren’t round beads, but bone relics with the face of Buddha carved on them.
 The Buddha on each pearl had a kind look on his face. He looked kind, noble, and powerful.
 Lin Jiufeng saw it at first glance.
 But in an instant, he frowned.
 Because his vision was very strong, he could see the true appearance beneath the surface.
 On the back of these beads, there were faces that looked like an evil demon that had crawled out of hell, filled with evil.
 Buddha and the demon were one. What was this old monk trying to do?
 Lin Jiufeng looked at him cautiously.
 “Emperor Jiufeng, I am Anan. Welcome.” The old monk smiled.
 Lin Jiufeng frowned. “You know me?”
 “The number one powerhouse in the world, the foundation of the Yuhua God Dynasty, and the powerhouse who suppresses all the Myriad Races. Who doesn’t know about this?” Monk Anan said with a smile. It was just that his already relaxed skin and shriveled face made him look like a demon when he smiled.
 “I didn’t expect my reputation to be so great that it even spread to the Great Thunderclap Temple of the Western Desert.” Lin Jiufeng sneered.
 He didn’t believe such nonsense.
 “An old friend told me. At the same time, he asked me to tell Emperor Jiufeng something,” Monk Anan said.
 “What is it?” Lin Jiufeng frowned at him.
 Monk Anan suddenly waved his hand and his thin body erupted like a volcano. Boundless power surged out from his body in an earth-shattering manner.
 At the same time, in this ancient city, the Great Thunderclap Temple also surged with infinite power.
 In the very next moment, countless array patterns appeared out of thin air and instantly drowned this area. A vast curtain of light shrouded the land.
 Lin Jiufeng immediately wanted to tear through the void and leave.
 But the space was sealed by the array patterns. He couldn’t tear it apart no matter how hard he tried.
 Lin Jiufeng wanted to escape. He knew that he had been tricked. The sudden array formation shrouded him, catching him off guard.
 But he couldn’t escape. With a bang, the ancient city completely became a huge array.
 It trapped Lin Jiufeng inside.
 However, Lin Jiufeng didn’t panic. Instead, he observed calmly.
 This was an extremely complicated and profound ancient array. Every step it took was filled with killing intent as it completely sealed this area!
 Lin Jiufeng vaguely recognized that this was a corner of an invincible killing array. The divine runes flowing in the air came from the era of the God Race and the Immortal Court.
 When the two combined, their majestic and complicated Dao runes were born. The array formation was densely packed with it.
 The ancient array formation sealed the land and suppressed Lin Jiufeng, preventing him from escaping. It also shocked the monks around him.
 But no one cared about the ascetics. Under the seal of the array formation, Monk Anan looked at Lin Jiufeng with a smile.
 His smile was like that of a demon. It swept away the amiable monk’s appearance from before. The Buddha beads in his hand also turned over, revealing the appearance of an evil demon.
 “Emperor Jiufeng, if we kill you, the Yuhua God Dynasty will no longer have a pillar of support.” A young man walked out from behind Monk Anan.
 The young man was dressed in the clothes of the Martial Temple. He looked at Lin Jiufeng calmly.
 His cultivation base was only at the False Immortal Realm, but he and Monk Anan were on equal footing.
 Monk Anan’s sudden outburst made Lin Jiufeng realize how terrifying he was.
 Perfected Immortal Realm!
 A False Immortal and a True Immortal standing on equal footing. This scene was a little strange.
 “You are a student of the Martial Temple?” Lin Jiufeng placed his hands behind his back and looked at the young man calmly. He didn’t take the array formations around him seriously at all.
 “I was before, but not anymore.” The young man smiled proudly.
 “I also have to thank you for building the Martial Temple so well and teaching the students for free. It allowed the poor me in this life to quickly cultivate to the False Immortal Realm and recover my old memories,” the young man smiled and said.
 “Old memories?” Lin Jiufeng frowned.
 “I’m an orthodox soldier of the Immortal Court. I died in battle back then and am now reincarnated into this world,” the young man said proudly.
 “There are still reincarnations in this world?” Lin Jiufeng didn’t care about his attitude. Instead, he was concerned about this matter.
 If reincarnation was possible, he could also quickly revive Emperor Yuan and Emperor Ming.
 This was what Lin Jiufeng had promised at the beginning.
 Back then, he thought that he could do it very quickly.
 But looking back at the past, his thoughts were really too childish.
 He didn’t know anything and didn’t know the immensity of the world. He only wanted to revive others. The ignorant were simply fearless.
 Even the current Lin Jiufeng also couldn’t revive them yet.
 That was why he was staring at this young man in front of him.
 “I don’t want to tell you about this matter, and you aren’t worthy of knowing. It’s just that there are no heroes left in this era, allowing you to make a name for yourself. See, today, you fell into a trap so easily,” the young man said disdainfully.
 Lin Jiufeng stared at him with a deep gaze.
 But the young man wasn’t afraid at all. He looked at Lin Jiufeng disdainfully.
 “You are now suppressed by a corner of Monk Anan’s killing array. What can you use to fight me?” The young man mocked.
 Monk Anan sighed and said, “If I were still at my peak, I could have killed this Emperor Jiufeng with one finger. I wouldn’t need to use this corner of the killing array.”
 “Your array formation can trap me, but it can’t kill me!” Lin Jiufeng snorted coldly.
 Roar…
 Right at this moment, Monk Anan suddenly roared. A dense head of black hair instantly grew out of his originally bald head. It danced like chaotic grass. He became thousands of years younger in a breath!
 He was originally incomparably old, having lost countless years. He was extremely old, like a person waiting for death.
 But now, after a loud roar, his body suddenly changed. He directly became tall and mighty, turning into the appearance of a middle-aged man.
 But the current him was very terrifying. His resplendent eyes erupted with a bright light. It was very terrifying as if he had gone mad.
 His roar directly activated this corner of the killing array.
 Rumble!
 Killing intent filled the air. There was a huge array formation blocking it, and it directly rampaged inside, causing Lin Jiufeng’s skin to split apart, unable to bear the might of the array formation.
 Lin Jiufeng frowned. Using the General Appointing Platform as his base, he stepped out.
 Boom!
 A powerful light exploded from the General Appointing Platform, directly destroying the array runes that were charging towards Lin Jiufeng.
 Seeing this, Monk Anan shouted again.
 In an instant, the mountains collapsed, and the earth split.
 With the second roar, the ancient city completely collapsed.
 At this moment, the Great Thunderclap Temple was also reduced to dust. It was destroyed by this killing array.
 When Lin Jiufeng saw this scene, his expression changed.
 “Perfected Immortal nomological powers!”
 Lin Jiufeng discovered that the Perfected Immortal nomological powers flowed in this corner of the killing array.
 But what he did next wasn’t to become afraid.
 Instead, he took out the Perfected Immortal Seed and directly let it take root and germinate on the General Appointing Platform.
 ‘A Perfected Immortal Seed that grows in such an environment should be very powerful, right?’ Lin Jiufeng’s eyes flashed. He stopped resisting and let the Perfected Immortal nomological powers strike his body.
 Even if a Perfected Immortal nomological power swept over and killed Lin Jiufeng, he would instantly use the mystic technique of See Immortality in the Cycle of Reincarnation to revive.
 He began the process of being cut into pieces.
 During this process, this corner of the killing array really tried its best to kill Lin Jiufeng.
 But they didn’t notice that on the Platform, a flower was slowly blooming.
 It was the flower that bloomed from Lin Jiufeng’s Perfected Immortal Seed.

                    



 Chapter 316: 36 Perfected Immortal Nomological Powers  This flower that grew from the soil of suffering and blood was very beautiful.
 This corner of a killing array was very terrifying. The killing intent, baleful aura, and terrifying energy fluctuations that erupted from it were like surging waves that turned the world upside down.
 This killing intent caused the world to tremble.
 At this moment, the killing array slashed down. Lin Jiufeng’s body instantly splattered apart into flesh and blood, scattering on the General Appointing Platform and the Perfected Immortal Seed.
 After absorbing Lin Jiufeng’s flesh and blood, absorbing the terrifying attack of this killing array, the Perfected Immortal Seed germinated and bloomed. It was very beautiful.
 Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled all around.
 Energy surged all around.
 Ice and snow surrounded them.
 But this flower watered by Lin Jiufeng’s flesh and blood bloomed on the General Appointing Platform.
 It bloomed very beautifully.
 Lin Jiufeng was constantly being killed in this corner of the killing array. But his source energy was very powerful now. When he used the [See Immortality in the Cycle of Reincarnation] technique, he could reverse life and death.
 Boom!
 Another Great Dao rune filled with killing intent directly struck Lin Jiufeng’s body, causing his body to collapse.
 Once again, blood splattered on the flower.
 It became even more beautiful looking.
 Because of the General Appointing Platform, Monk Anan and the young man didn’t notice it.
 See Immortality in the Cycle of Reincarnation!
 Lin Jiufeng gritted his teeth. He once again reversed life and death, recovering from death. He comprehended the Dao in the state of nirvana and returned to life.
 In a corner of the killing array, Monk Anan, who was in the safe spot of the killing aura, frowned and said, “It’s really difficult for him to die.”
 “That’s normal. After all, he’s the Son of Destiny of this era, the first immortal. His source energy is powerful, but continuing to revive like this will consume his source energy. If we kill him a few more times, he won’t be that powerful anymore,” the young man said.
 “But why do I feel that I’m panicking?” Monk Anan frowned and asked.
 His cultivation base was very powerful and was at the Perfected Immortal Realm.
 He appeared in this era of the recovery of spiritual energy and quickly reached the Perfected Immortal Realm.
 Hence, the panic of a Perfected Immortal meant that something bad was about to happen.
 “Do you think this Great Emperor Jiufeng can stir up a storm in this corner of the killing array?” The young man mocked.
 Monk Anan watched as the killing array surrounded and killed Lin Jiufeng. When Lin Jiufeng was revived, the killing array once again blasted him into pieces.
 He suddenly heaved a sigh of relief.
 “Perhaps it’s the panic from killing the Son of Destiny of this era.” Monk Anan comforted himself.
 Seeing that Lin Jiufeng had once again reversed life and death and come back to life, Monk Anan said, “No matter how much you struggle, it won’t change the current situation. This killing array is passed down from an Immortal King. It’s simply more than enough to kill an immortal like you. How many more times can you revive? You were killed time and time again and have experienced death so many times. Could it be that you have a masochistic tendon?”
 Monk Anan didn’t understand.
 “Monk, you’ve killed me 36 times. I’ve died 36 times,” Lin Jiufeng said solemnly. Taking advantage of the fact that he had just recovered, he took a deep breath. At the same time, his comprehension of the Great Dao continued to climb.
 “Then, please die earlier, Great Emperor Jiufeng, instead of continuing to struggle,” Monk Anan said coldly.
 “Monk, do you know what I saw in the 36 deaths?” Lin Jiufeng suddenly asked.
 Lin Jiufeng stood on the General Appointing Platform, his face pale. After 36 deaths, his source energy was almost depleted.
 Monk Anan also saw this.
 He chuckled and said with a cold gaze, “I wonder what you saw in the cycle of death?”
 “I saw a flower!” Lin Jiufeng constantly absorbed the spiritual energy to make up for his lost source energy as he said.
 “A flower?” Monk Anan frowned and looked at Lin Jiufeng.
 The young man by the side snorted coldly and said, “What an act. You can even see a flower in the cycle of life and death? What you saw was probably the Red Spider Flower, it’s here to bring your soul into the cycle of reincarnation.”
 “That’s a flower that bloomed on the Great Dao!” Lin Jiufeng shook his head and smiled.
 “A flower that bloomed on the Great Dao?”
 “I think you are talking nonsense. You are simply ignorant.”
 “Monk Anan, use the array formation to kill him. He has depleted his source energy and has been stalling for time.” The young man’s killing intent was overflowing. He stared at Lin Jiufeng and discovered Lin Jiufeng’s state of weakness.
 A sharp light flashed in Monk Anan’s eyes as he controlled this corner of the killing array.
 Rumble!
 The killing array rotated like a huge millstone that was crushing the world, wanting to crush Lin Jiufeng into dust.
 “So what if you see a flower of the Great Dao? I will destroy you in this world now.” Monk Anan’s expression became very evil-looking. The demonic Buddha beads in his hand rotated as he let out a cackle. It was very terrifying.
 In the very next moment, the Great Dao runes of the array formation pressed down.
 Lin Jiufeng watched. After 36 deaths, there was only a small amount of his source energy left.
 If he died this time, he would no longer be able to execute the See Immortality in the Cycle of Reincarnation technique.
 But…
 Lin Jiufeng wasn’t afraid at all.
 Instead, he looked at the flower on the General Appointing Platform with a relaxed smile.
 It had completely matured now.
 Lin Jiufeng wanted to reach out and stroke this flower of the Great Dao that was watered with his blood.
 But in the very next moment, this corner of the killing array fell.
 Boom!
 Lin Jiufeng’s entire body exploded. This time, no flesh and blood splattered. There was only endless energy that instantly exploded.
 This huge energy was about to sweep in all directions.
 But in the very next moment, time and space froze.
 The entire killing array also froze.
 Including Monk Anan and the reincarnated young man.
 They watched in horror, but they found that they couldn’t move at all.
 They could only see a flower.
 A flower that flickered with the light of the Great Dao appeared in this corner of the killing array.
 Flower of the Great Dao!
 At this moment, Monk Anan and the young man recalled Lin Jiufeng’s words.
 They could only watch helplessly as the flower froze the energy that appeared from Lin Jiufeng’s explosion in the air and then gathered it into this flower.
 The flower bloomed!
 The flower fell!
 Lin Jiufeng appeared in the air.
 It was still the same him, but the difference was his realm.
 He directly broke through the Nine Restrictions of the Immortal and stepped into the Perfected Immortal Realm.
 “The nomological powers of the Perfected Immortal Realm. I see.” Lin Jiufeng’s heart moved. He now held 36 nomological powers of the Perfected Immortal Realm.
 Then, Lin Jiufeng looked at Monk Anan and the young man.
 “As I said, I saw the flower of the Great Dao, but you guys didn’t believe me!” Lin Jiufeng shook his head, feeling very regretful. Then, he punched out.
 Boom!
 Thousands of tsunamis, lightning surging, and volcanoes erupting. Everything was branded in this punch at this moment.
 Lin Jiufeng didn’t use any cultivation technique in this punch.
 He just held the 36 Perfected Immortal nomological powers and punched out.
 At this moment, the freezing of space ended.
 At this moment, this corner of the killing array was activated.
 At this moment, Lin Jiufeng went wild.
 The heavens and the deities were nothing in his eyes.
 With this punch, even if deities came, he would still kill them.
 This was an extremely confident aura of being invincible and attaining the Dao. Everything would fall under his punch.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 An intense impact, a powerful force, and the 36 nomological powers roared into the sky like 36 ancient ancestral dragons.
 This corner of the killing array was instantly torn apart.
 Lin Jiufeng, who was at the Immortal Realm previously, couldn’t tear apart this corner of the killing array.
 But now, at the Perfected Immortal Realm, he could do it.
 The collapse of this corner of the killing array shattered the ancient city and the fake Great Thunderclap Temple together, turning the area into a region of raging flames.
 Lin Jiufeng walked out of the flames.
 “Run. This person is too sick. He actually broke through to the Perfected Immortal Realm. Moreover, he has 36 Perfected Immortal nomological powers as soon as he broke through. He’s too terrifying.” Monk Anan’s expression changed drastically. He was trembling in fear. His worldview had been shattered.
 Lin Jiufeng even shattered this corner of a killing array that was left behind by an Immortal King.
 After 36 deaths, he actually broke through to the Perfected Immortal Realm and comprehended 36 nomological powers.
 It should be known that back then when he broke through to the Perfected Immortal Realm, he only obtained one nomological law.
 One could imagine how scared he was now.
 Hence, Monk Anan immediately ran away, not daring to stop at all.
 The young man who had reincarnated was the same. He was greatly shocked. He was only at the False Immortal Realm, how could he resist Lin Jiufeng who was at the Perfected Immortal Realm?
 He decisively escaped with Monk Anan.
 After shattering a corner of the killing array, Lin Jiufeng narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Can you guys escape?”
 He took a step forward and millions of Dao patterns instantly burst out in the air, turning into transmission array runes.
 With a tap of his hand, a spatial passageway immediately appeared. Five-colored divine light flickered. This path seemed to have passed through heaven and headed for the end of eternity.
 Five colors and ten lights flickered. They instantly arrived in front of Monk Anan and the young man with Lin Jiufeng.
 In an instant, Lin Jiufeng blocked them.
 “You guys can’t escape!” He said coldly.
 Even though Monk Anan had already become a middle-aged monk and wasn’t looking dispirited and lifeless like before, facing the terrifying Lin Jiufeng, his expression couldn’t help but panic.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, if you let me go, I will tell you everything I know.” Monk Anan knew that he couldn’t defeat Lin Jiufeng anymore. He wasn’t at his peak at all. Previously, he had relied on the corner of a killing array to scheme against Lin Jiufeng.
 Now that he no longer had the corner of a killing array, if they really fought, he was no match for Lin Jiufeng at all.
 He didn’t even have the confidence to defeat Lin Jiufeng who was at the Immortal Realm previously.
 Not to mention the current Lin Jiufeng, who was at the Perfected Immortal Realm and had 36 Perfected Immortal nomological powers.
 “What do you know?” Lin Jiufeng asked coldly.
 “I know about the Great Thunderclap Temple,” Monk Anan said without hesitation.
 “Wasn’t the Great Thunderclap Temple destroyed?” Lin Jiufeng sneered.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, you must be kidding. You can definitely tell that this Great Thunderclap Temple of mine is fake. I know where the real Great Thunderclap Temple is.” Monk Anan smiled in embarrassment and said.
 Lin Jiufeng’s eyes were deep as he looked at the young man beside Monk Anan.
 “You can live, but what about him?” Lin Jiufeng said coldly.
 As soon as these words came out, the young man’s expression changed drastically. He quickly distanced himself from Monk Anan and stared fixedly at them.
 “You guys want to kill me?” The young man’s expression was very ugly as if he had eaten shit.
 “Isn’t this obvious?” Lin Jiufeng sneered.
 “You are a False Immortal, like meat on a chopping board. You have no way of escaping,” he added.
 “Great Emperor Jiufeng, I know a lot about the Immortal Court. I’m a warrior of the Immortal Court back then. I can tell you everything I know, as long as you spare my life.” In his anxiety, the young man copied Monk Anan and begged for mercy.
 “Sure.” Lin Jiufeng’s attitude suddenly changed 180 degrees. Then, he reached out and pointed at the young man and Monk Anan’s glabella.
 Boom!
 Their soul source energies were held in Lin Jiufeng’s hands now.
 “Your lives are now in my hands. If you are disobedient, I can directly crush you both to death, or I can make you all wish you were dead!” Lin Jiufeng said coldly.
 The faces of Monk Anan and the young man darkened completely. They were dejected and felt their vision turning dark.
 “Come, bring me to the real Great Thunderclap Temple!” Lin Jiufeng ordered.

                    



 Chapter 317: Great Thunderclap Temple  Monk Anan and the young man were now under Lin Jiufeng’s control. They were dejected and lost.
 They couldn’t figure it out.
 What exactly went wrong?
 Why was it that even though he had activated a corner of the killing array left behind by the Immortal King, it was still useless against Lin Jiufeng?
 Lin Jiufeng wouldn’t explain this problem to them.
 Now, the two of them were leading the way to the real Great Thunderclap Temple.
 “Where is the real Great Thunderclap Temple?” Lin Jiufeng asked them on the way.
 Monk Anan returned to his old appearance. With a hunchback, he said, “The real Great Thunderclap Temple has actually long become a relic.”
 “It became a relic?” Lin Jiufeng frowned.
 “Didn’t they say that the legacy of the Great Thunderclap Temple has always been around?” Lin Jiufeng asked, puzzled.
 “The legacy of the Great Thunderclap Temple has always been around, but the original Great Thunderclap Temple is no longer around,” Monk Anan explained.
 “What do you mean?” Lin Jiufeng frowned and looked at him.
 “In the ruins of the Great Thunderclap Temple, there is the legacy of Great Emperor Shakyamuni. Those who are fated can obtain it. That’s why I said that the legacy of the Great Thunderclap Temple hasn’t been severed.”
 “But the real Great Thunderclap Temple became a relic 20,000 years ago.”
 Monk Anan pressed his palms together and said.
 “What happened 20,000 years ago that turned the Great Thunderclap Temple into a relic?” Lin Jiufeng was thinking about this problem.
 Another thing that happened 20,000 years ago.
 20,000 years ago should have been the war between the Immortal Court and the God Race.
 Lin Jiufeng couldn’t help but look at the young man.
 “Do you know?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “20,000 years ago, no one from the Great Thunderclap Temple appeared in the battle between the Immortal Court and the God Race. At least, no one appeared in the battle which I died from,” the young man said.
 He was the weakest among the three of them now. He had just awakened and his strength hadn’t increased at all, so he didn’t dare to be impudent.
 Facing Lin Jiufeng’s question, his attitude was very good. He answered whatever Lin Jiufeng asked. His previous arrogance and smugness were now gone.
 “Tell me the details of the war between the Immortal Court and the God Race back then,” Lin Jiufeng asked solemnly.
 “Why would an organization as big as the Immortal Court fight to the death with the God Race?”
 “Also, how was the top combat power of the God Race and the Immortal Court ranked?”
 “Tell me in detail. If you lie, I will be able to distinguish it. By that time, you will definitely die.”
 Lin Jiufeng looked at the young man coldly. The killing intent in his eyes was undisguised as he stared at him blatantly.
 The young man cursed Lin Jiufeng in his heart, but he looked as gentle as a sheep on the surface.
 “I was a small team leader of the Immortal Court previously, my name is Ouyang Xiu. I had 100 soldiers under me, and I guarded the gate of the Immortal Court. I was an insignificant character, so I don’t know about the grudges between the higher-ups of the Immortal Court.”
 “I only know that after the birth of the God Race, the Immortal Court and the God Race had never gotten along. Moreover, in the beginning, the Immortal Court was suppressed and beaten by the God Race.”
 Ouyang Xiu recalled the past and said sincerely.
 He didn’t dare to lie.
 Because Lin Jiufeng was standing right in front of him, staring at him silently. The pressure was so great that he didn’t dare to lie.
 If Lin Jiufeng discovered a lie, he would die.
 He decisively chose to tell the truth.
 “The Immortal Court was so powerful, suppressing an era, yet they were still suppressed by the gods?” Monk Anan said in surprise.
 Lin Jiufeng watched silently from the side.
 “I’m also very puzzled about this. The God Race seemed to have appeared out of nowhere and shook the world all of a sudden. The Immortal Court really suffered a huge loss. At one time, they were beaten into retreat, losing a lot of territories. Even the powerhouses suffered heavy casualties,” Ouyang Xiu said seriously.
 “Then, how did the Immortal Court respond?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “Then, the top powerhouses of the Immortal Court came out of seclusion. There was also the emergence of the female War God lineage, especially the first female War God who was simply absurdly ferocious. She easily killed people of the God Race, forcing them to retreat, and also rebuilt the glory of the Immortal Court,” Ouyang Xiu said excitedly.
 Especially when it came to the female War God, his eyes lit up.
 But Lin Jiufeng frowned.
 He heard about the female War God again.
 Moreover, this time, it was the first generation War God.
 “There are many generations of female War Gods?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “That’s not the case. There were only seven generations of female War Gods.” Ouyang Xiu shook his head.
 “That’s quite a lot. In one era, the female War God lineage actually passed down seven generations. According to you, the female War God who can easily defeat the powerhouses of the God Race should be able to live for a very, very long time,” Monk Anan said.
 “This is the God Race’s credit. They simply went all out to kill the female War Gods. Every generation of the female War God was lured into a trap and killed by the God Race, which is why the invincible female War God of the seventh generation existed.” Ouyang Xiu shook his head.
 “The invincible female War God of the seventh generation?” Lin Jiufeng raised his brows.
 He immediately thought of the female War God suppressed by the descendants of the God Race in the Third World.
 She was probably the invincible War God of the seventh generation.
 “Yes, there are only two publicly acknowledged most powerful beings among the female War Gods—the first and seventh generations.”
 “The first generation experienced the war and helped the Immortal Court solve the chaos. Unfortunately, she was ultimately killed by a terrifying existence who crossed over from another world.”
 “As for the seventh generation, wherever she went, the God Race would tremble in fear. It would be easy for her to tear an Immortal King apart with her bare hands.”
 “Without a choice, the God Race plotted against her and lured her to the Third World, the base camp of the God Race. Then, the collapse of the Third World happened.”
 “I also saw it that time. A huge change happened in the Third World. The female War God fought an intense battle there. The people of the Immortal Court saw the aftermath of the battle clearly.”
 “Just as we were about to go and help her, the God Race had already come out of their world. A great war of the century started without warning.”
 “I also participated in the battle with the soldiers under my command. I was exhausted from the battle, and in the end, I was swept by the aftershocks of an Immortal King and died on the spot.”
 “If it weren’t for the Immortal Court’s supreme treasure, the Eternal Dragon Boat, being summoned in time and saving me, I would have died at that time.”
 Ouyang Xiu said as he walked. He didn’t lie because he knew that lying in front of Lin Jiufeng would only anger him.
 He had just reincarnated, how could he bear to die?
 Moreover, he was talking about what had already happened. It wasn’t a big deal.
 Lin Jiufeng and Monk Anan fell silent upon hearing this.
 The battle between the Immortal Court and the God Race directly wiped out an era.
 “You aren’t lying about what you said. Then, the first thing you did after you awakened your past memories was to come here to look for Monk Anan. What was your motive?” Lin Jiufeng asked slowly.
 He stared at Monk Anan and Ouyang Xiu.
 His calm gaze gave them a huge pressure.
 “I wanted to try and wake up the powerhouses of the Immortal Court.” Ouyang Xiu had just been resurrected and his cultivation base was low. He couldn’t resist Lin Jiufeng’s gaze and answered honestly.
 Monk Anan nodded and said, “He told me that he wants to revive the powerhouses of the Immortal Court and then get them to help me obtain the legacy in the ruins of the Great Thunderclap Temple.”
 “There are still people alive from the Immortal Court?” Lin Jiufeng frowned. His heart skipped a beat, and his eyes turned sharp as he stared at the two of them.

                    



 Chapter 318: Sincere Feelings  There were actually still people from the Immortal Court alive in this world?
 This was something Lin Jiufeng didn’t expect. He stared fixedly at Ouyang Xiu, wanting to figure out what exactly was going on.
 Ouyang Xiu replied, “From what I know, there are indeed seniors from the Immortal Court in the Western Desert. I don’t know how many of them are there, but there definitely are.”
 “Weren’t the people of the Immortal Court wiped out by the God Race?” Lin Jiufeng asked solemnly.
 “That war broke out very suddenly. For the Immortal Court, they were caught off guard. At that time, there was an army of the Immortal Court suppressing the Western Desert, so they didn’t participate in this battle.”
 “The army of the Western Desert has been suppressing the Western Desert all this time. They are not allowed to leave. Therefore, even though the Immortal Court suffered heavy losses in that battle and was completely wiped out, this team still remained.”
 “In this era, I don’t know how many of them are left. But I know that some of them are definitely still alive now.”
 Ouyang Xiu felt uneasy under Lin Jiufeng’s oppressive gaze and said honestly.
 “I’m very curious as to why they want to suppress the Western Desert. Other than the Great Thunderclap Temple, the Western Desert is just a remote corner and doesn’t compete with the outside world. Why did they leave an army behind to suppress the Western Desert?” Monk Anan asked in puzzlement.
 He had known Ouyang Xiu for many years.
 Ouyang Xiu was born in the Western Desert, but he was very rebellious when he was young. He couldn’t understand the Buddhist scriptures and yearned for the outside world.
 Hence, he bade farewell to his only friend and went to the Immortal Court. He worked hard to establish a stable foothold in the Immortal Court and became a commander.
 The friend that he bade farewell to was Monk Anan.
 Hence, Ouyang Xiu, who had just awakened and was reborn, directly came to the Western Desert to look for Monk Anan.
 Moreover, the moment he asked for help, Monk Anan used the corner of the killing array that he had painstakingly obtained to kill Lin Jiufeng for him.
 Their relationship was indeed quite deep.
 Now that the lives of these two brothers were in Lin Jiufeng’s hands, it was also a special kind of fate.
 It wasn’t easy for the two of them to still be alive in this world from 20,000 years ago to 20,000 years later and could still trust each other so much.
 Regarding Monk Anan’s question, Ouyang Xiu sighed and said, “I’m just a small team leader of the Immortal Court, a small character. How would I know so many secrets? In the great era, you and I are just duckweeds that drift with the waves. I just know that the Immortal Court still places a lot of importance on the Western Desert. It can even be said that the Immortal Court reveres the Western Desert.”
 “Revere?” Lin Jiufeng immediately noticed this word.
 “The Immortal Court isn’t afraid of the God Race. The Immortal Court used to suppress the world. According to you, the Immortal Court is extremely powerful. Why would they revere the Western Desert then?” Lin Jiufeng immediately asked.
 Monk Anan also looked at his old friend curiously.
 “I’ve heard of a rumor, but it’s not confirmed.”
 “Some people say that beneath the Western Desert, the Lord of Hell is buried. Outside the Western Desert is the Buddhist Sect, but inside is Hell. The higher-ups of the Immortal Court have suffered a blow in the Western Desert.”
 Ouyang Xiu said.
 “There’s actually a hell beneath the Western Desert? Why didn’t I know about this?” Monk Anan shook his head. He didn’t believe this rumor.
 “I’ve lived in the Western Desert for more than 20,000 years and have never left. I’ve studied Buddhist scriptures and techniques, comprehending the Dao left behind by Great Emperor Shakyamuni. I’ve never seen a demon appear before,” Monk Anan said.
 Lin Jiufeng pointed with his finger and questioned, “Don’t you look like a demon now?”
 Especially the Buddha beads in his hand. One side was Buddha and the other was a demon.
 Monk Anan was instantly embarrassed.
 He stammered, “I… I studied the Buddhist scriptures on my own, but I never obtained the true meaning of them. Gradually, a mental demon was born in me, turning my respect for Great Emperor Shakyamuni into resentment. I became an existence that was half Buddha and half-demon.”
 “So you established the fake Great Thunderclap Temple and disguised yourself as Buddha to enjoy the incense offerings of the people?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 Monk Anan nodded and said helplessly, “I’ve never been able to comprehend the Dao of Great Emperor Shakyamuni. I felt extremely upset. In the end, I became demonized. I disguised the city you saw just now as the already disappeared Great Thunderclap Temple. Then, under the worship of the people of the world, I slowly walked back from the edge of becoming a demon. Now, I’m half Buddha and half-demon.”
 “I already said that it’s just rumors, it’s normal for it to be inaccurate. But the wariness of the Immortal Court towards the Western Desert really exists. Even we weren’t allowed to contact the troops guarding the Western Desert. They are independent of the outside world. At that time, very few people inside the Immortal Court knew what they were doing in the Western Desert,” Ouyang Xiu said.
 “Then, do you know the exact location of this army?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “There’s a general direction, but we need to search carefully,” Ouyang Xiu said.
 “Then, let’s go to the ruins of Great Thunderclap Temple first before looking for this army,” Lin Jiufeng said solemnly.
 The army of the Immortal Court still existed in the Western Desert. But as long as Ouyang Xiu was by his side and didn’t wake them up, there wouldn’t be any danger for the time being.
 He had to do things one by one.
 The most important thing at the moment was to find the relic of the Great Thunderclap Temple and investigate it thoroughly.
 Lin Jiufeng still had high hopes for the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 Moreover, he felt that the waters of this world were becoming deeper and deeper.
 In the past, he felt that he was already invincible just by reaching the Human God Realm.
 But later on, he felt that he was invincible after becoming an immortal.
 And now, he really felt very insignificant. Compared to those people who could leave their names in history, he was simply too fragile.
 He thought that after suppressing the Myriad Races, the world would be peaceful.
 But who would have thought that the Third World, the descendants of the God Race, and a sleeping War God would all appear?
 Now, there was also the Great Thunderclap Temple, the army of the Immortal Court, and the Great Emperor Shakyamuni from 100,000 years ago.
 These things were all very confusing and no one came to explain them to him.
 Lin Jiufeng could only rely on himself to find the answers.
 To Lin Jiufeng, the army of the Immortal Court wasn’t as attractive as the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 Hence, he was still determined to let Monk Anan lead the way to the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 “How much longer before we reach the Great Thunderclap Temple?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 With their speeds, wouldn’t it be easy for them to arrive at the destination very quickly?
 No matter how big the Western Desert was, they could easily travel back and forth within a day.
 Unless it was hidden like the Third World. Those who didn’t know couldn’t find the entrance at all.
 Monk Anan replied, “It’s not that far away. The relic of the Great Thunderclap Temple is in the 10,000 Mountain Caves of the Western Desert.”
 “What kind of place is the 10,000 Mountain Caves?” Lin Jiufeng asked.
 “That’s a place that has been carved with countless murals, carvings, and Buddha statues of the Buddhist sects since ancient times,” Monk Anan said with a trace of respect.
 “Is this place very famous?” Ouyang Xiu asked.
 “No. I’m the only one who knows about this place now. I set up an array formation and blocked the surroundings, preventing anyone from discovering this place. For 20,000 years, no one has discovered this place.” Monk Anan shook his head.
 “This is also the reason why no one discovered that the Great Thunderclap Temple built by me is a fake one. Because they couldn’t find where the real Great Thunderclap Temple was, so I naturally became real.” Monk Anan self-mocked.
 “Every once in a while, I will go and live there for a period of time. I will look at the murals, the statues of Buddha, and the scriptures carved on the stone monoliths. I wanted to comprehend the Great Emperor Shakyamuni’s Dao.”
 “But it’s a pity!”
 “I gained nothing. The only thing that filled me with hope was that every time I went, it would make me calm down and think about my origins silently. I would check on myself to prevent myself from falling deeper into the Demon Path.”
 “That’s why I still have a lot of respect and admiration for Buddha. Buddha’s wisdom is unfathomable, just that I’m unable to comprehend it.”
 Monk Anan said sincerely.

                    



 Chapter 319: A Range of 500 Miles  Monk Anan was once young and reckless. He thought that he was a peerless genius.
 Unlike Ouyang Xiu.
 He could absorb the teachings of the Buddhist scriptures, he could also comprehend the principles in the Buddhist scriptures. Then, after pointers from older monks, he could even make analogies of the principles.
 When he was young, he was very proud of himself. Although he looked modest on the surface, he was very proud inside, thinking that no one in the world was smarter than him.
 At that time, the Great Thunderclap Temple was still around. He hoped to enter the Great Thunderclap Temple, so he headed to it.
 But this path ended in failure.
 He didn’t even pass the entrance examination of the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 He had a mental breakdown.
 He was furious.
 The most embarrassing thing in his life was swearing like a shrew in front of the Buddha statue of Great Emperor Shakyamuni in the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 Then, decades later…
 The Immortal Court and the God Race started a war. A huge change happened in the world, and the Great Thunderclap Temple directly turned into a relic. No one knew the reason.
 At that time, Monk Anan encountered the relic of the Great Thunderclap Temple. He was in a hurry and wanted to move Great Emperor Shakyamuni’s Buddhist scripture out and comprehend it himself. But he couldn’t comprehend it.
 The thoughts transmitted by Great Emperor Shakyamuni’s Buddhist scriptures were in conflict with his strong rebellious thoughts from his youth.
 Either he listened obediently to the thoughts transmitted by Great Emperor Shakyamuni’s scriptures or continued on his own path.
 Monk Anan was in a dilemma for the rest of his life.
 So much so that he became demonized.
 After becoming a demon, he finally woke up and realized that he had gone to the extreme.
 Then, he seriously reflected on his actions and reestablished the Great Thunderclap Temple. He became a fake Buddha and imparted the wisdom of the Great Thunderclap Temple to others.
 As for himself, he had been constantly comprehending the scriptures.
 As he aged and his experience increased, and as the thickness of his thoughts deepened, many of the scriptures that he thought were fake in the past were gradually recognized by him.
 Hence, Monk Anan had an extremely complicated feeling towards Great Emperor Shakyamuni.
 But in the end, thinking about it carefully, it was still just one word.
 He [Love] Great Emperor Shakyamuni.
 Hence, after 20,000 years, the relic of the Great Thunderclap Temple had been well-preserved without any damage by him.
 Until now, Monk Anan brought Lin Jiufeng to the 10,000 Mountain Caves.
 After opening the seal, what they saw was still a complete Great Thunderclap Temple that was buried deep underground. It was astonishing.
 Monk Anan said, “After the Great Thunderclap Temple became a relic, it was buried deep in the desert. The 10,000 Mountain Caves was the name that I gave it. The desert is boundless and extremely lacking in water. The temperature is very high. No one is willing to stay here, so naturally, no one can discover this place. And I have always treated this place as the resting place of the soul, coming here once in a while.”
 Entering the 10,000 Mountain Caves was equivalent to entering a strange and unbelievable underground world.
 Just like the undulating mountains on the ground.
 It was the same deep underground.
 There was a mountain peak here underground. On it was carved a Buddha with his eyes closed. His palms were pressed together, and his expression was serene. He looked lifelike as if he was real.
 There were also Buddhist scriptures carved on the stone walls. They were all original Buddhist scriptures. Some of them were even personally written by Great Emperor Shakyamuni.
 Lin Jiufeng entered and looked around. He felt a special feeling envelop him.
 These Buddhist scriptures were magnificent. These were the original scriptures from the beginning of Buddhism.
 [Do you want to Sign-In before the relic of the Great Thunderclap Temple?]
 Just as Lin Jiufeng was lamenting, a line of words appeared in front of his eyes.
 Lin Jiufeng agreed calmly.
 [Sign-In successful. Received the Three Lifetime Buddha Sutra!]
 A Buddhist scripture appeared in Lin Jiufeng’s mind. Then, the chanting of a supreme Supremacy sounded. Sanskrit entered his ears, and along with the Great Dao, it was transmitted into Lin Jiufeng’s memory.
 “What mystic technique is this Three Lifetime Buddha Sutra?” Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.
 Currently, he wouldn’t be able to understand Buddist scriptures yet.
 A hundred years ago, due to Emperor Yuan’s reforms, the Buddhist sects in the Jiangnan area were too rampant, causing Lin Jiufeng to have a poor impression of them. After that, he never studied the Buddhist sects in detail until now.
 Hence, he needed to figure out what this Three Lifetime Buddha Sutra was.
 [The Three Lifetime Buddha Sutra is a supreme technique of the Buddhist sects. It represents the crystallization of Great Emperor Shakyamuni’s comprehension of the Dao. It consists of the Maitreya Sutra of the past, the Buddha Sutra of the present, and the Lifeless Sutra of the future. These three sutras represent the three supreme states recorded in the Buddhist scripture. Together, they are the Three Lifetime Buddha Sutra.]
 This piece of information made Lin Jiufeng look up in surprise. It turned out that the Three Lifetime Buddha Sutra was actually a supreme technique that involved time.
 “This is too powerful. I have to study it seriously.” Lin Jiufeng began to learn this technique. The Three Lifetime Buddha Sutra flowed like water into his heart.
 Silently, Lin Jiufeng became stronger again.
 Monk Anan opened the barrier and said as he walked in front, “The Great Thunderclap Temple was originally built in the mountains and ravines. It was incomparably magnificent, but later on, it declined. The world changed drastically. A huge desert fell upon this land and turned the Great Thunderclap Temple into what it is now.”
 “Everything in the past has been buried beneath. If I hadn’t discovered it early, who knows how long the Great Thunderclap Temple would have been hidden for? Then, no one would know of the legend of Great Emperor Shakyamuni.” Monk Anan chuckled and said proudly.
 These words were also true.
 Lin Jiufeng agreed.
 Because without Monk Anan building the fake Great Thunderclap Temple in the Western Desert and spreading it for 20,000 years, the legacy of the Great Thunderclap Temple would have long been broken.
 Although Monk Anan wasn’t from the orthodox Great Thunderclap Temple, he had the scriptures of the Great Thunderclap Temple, the techniques of the Great Thunderclap Temple, and the heritage of the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 It was because of him that the legends of the Great Thunderclap Temple still existed in the Western Desert.
 “I have a feeling…” Ouyang Xiu, who had been silent all this time, suddenly raised his hand and said hesitantly.
 “What?” Lin Jiufeng looked at him.
 Monk Anan also looked at him.
 From the moment he entered the desert to the 10,000 Mountain Caves and then the relic of the Great Thunderclap Temple, he had been very quiet.
 It was as if something seemed to have happened that made him troubled.
 “I… sensed the energy fluctuations of a senior of the Immortal Court,” Ouyang Xiu swallowed his saliva and said.
 He himself was shocked too.
 Monk Anan’s eyelids twitched. His heart skipped a beat as he asked in disbelief, “What did you say?”
 “This is the relic of the Great Thunderclap Temple. I’ve been here alone for 20,000 years. How could it be that there are the people of the Immortal Court here?” Monk Anan shook his head frantically, not believing in this matter.
 Lin Jiufeng’s expression turned serious. He didn’t speak. He was waiting for Ouyang Xiu to explain.
 “But I really sensed it. Look.” Ouyang Xiu raised his left hand.
 His left hand emitted a luster and transformed into a [Immortal] word symbol.
 “This is the energy of the Immortal Court’s supreme treasure, the Eternal Dragon Boat. It can sense the people of the Immortal Court within a 500-mile radius, even if they are just corpses. I came to the Western Desert because I wanted to use this to find the army of the Immortal Court.”
 “Then, when I came here, It lit up on its own.”
 Monk Anan closed his mouth and kept quiet.
 Lin Jiufeng’s gaze was deep as he said, “In other words, there are people from the Immortal Court within a radius of 500 miles.”
 Ouyang Xiu looked at Lin Jiufeng in fear and nodded.

                    



 Chapter 320: A Kneeling Statue  Ouyang Xiu was very afraid now.
 He didn’t dare to hide this information.
 He was afraid that Lin Jiufeng would kill him.
 Hence, he didn’t dare to hide it, nor did he dare to have any other motives. After discovering the abnormality, he immediately told Lin Jiufeng.
 Otherwise, when Lin Jiufeng sensed that something was wrong, he would kill him with just a casual squeeze of his hand.
 Don’t forget that his soul energy source was still in Lin Jiufeng’s hands. It was really easy for him to kill Ouyang Xiu.
 At this moment, he looked at Lin Jiufeng, trembling.
 Fortunately, Lin Jiufeng didn’t have much killing intent. He only glanced at Ouyang Xiu and said, “Be careful with your next steps. Once you have confirmed the location of the people or the army of the Immortal Court, inform me immediately.”
 As if he had just escaped death, Ouyang Xiu nodded excitedly. “Great Emperor Jiufeng, rest assured. If I discover any abnormalities, I will tell you immediately.”
 Lin Jiufeng wasn’t worried that he would backstab him.
 Unless he was willing to give up the second life that he had painstakingly gained through reincarnation.
 “Continue forward,” Lin Jiufeng said to Monk Anan.
 Still the same as before, compared to the army of the Immortal Court, Lin Jiufeng was more interested in the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 With the Great Thunderclap Temple in front, Lin Jiufeng naturally chose to explore this place first.
 Especially when he had just signed in for the Three Lifetime Buddha Sutra. This was a supreme immortal technique passed down by Great Emperor Shakyamuni.
 Lin Jiufeng really wanted to know what the true Great Thunderclap Temple looked like.
 Deep underground, the original location of the Great Thunderclap Temple was well maintained without any damage.
 In this space, the Buddha statues were lifelike, and the scriptures were also very clear. After experiencing the baptism of time, the color of the Buddha statues actually didn’t change at all. It had to be said that Monk Anan protected them very well.
 Monk Anan brought Lin Jiufeng along. Along the way, they saw beautiful Thangkas telling about the magnificent achievements of Great Emperor Shakyamuni.
 The Thangkas were something unique to the land of the Western Regions. It was stories either recorded in murals or in huge paintings made with special crafts.
 These were collectively called Thangka.
 The Thangka here recorded the life of Great Emperor Shakyamuni.
 The life of Great Emperor Shakyamuni was painted here so that future generations would know what this supreme emperor had done.
 “These are the legends of Great Emperor Shakyamuni suppressing the ferocious beasts in the Western Regions back then.” Seeing Lin Jiufeng’s interest, Monk Anan introduced them softly.
 “These legends were recorded and were still spread in the land of the Western Regions 20,000 years ago. Unfortunately, with the destruction of the Great Thunderclap Temple, these legends completely disappeared with the death of the older generations,” Monk Anan said regretfully.
 “These Thangkas record the glory of Great Emperor Shakyamuni. They are vivid and lifelike. Great Emperor Shakyamuni looks quite gentle,” Lin Jiufeng said.
 “Buddha’s body is just a skin bag. He looks very gentle on usual days, but when he was suppressing the ferocious beasts in the Western Region back then, he was also a ferocious Vajra,” Monk Anan said.
 “What does this Thangka mean?” Lin Jiufeng suddenly pointed at a strange Thangka and asked.
 The Tangka that Lin Jiufeng pointed at had the painting of the Great Thunderclap Temple, but it was an incomplete Great Thunderclap Temple. Moreover, many places had been uprooted from the ground.
 Underneath the Great Thunderclap Temple, a huge Devil’s Den appeared. Countless ferocious and terrifying monsters crawled out from inside. They were ferocious and had huge bodies.
 They worked hard to destroy the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 This was the content of the Thangka that attracted Lin Jiufeng.
 Logically speaking, it was impossible for such a Thangka to appear in the Great Thunderclap Temple.
 The Great Thunderclap Temple in this Thangka had already completely collapsed.
 Monk Anan took a look and said, “I know about this Thangka. When I was young, I entered the Great Thunderclap Temple and asked the monks at that time. They told me that this Thangka was drawn by a disciple of Great Emperor Shakyamuni. They said that because this disciple hated Great Emperor Shakyamuni for treating him badly, he cursed the Great Thunderclap Temple to be overturned by the ferocious monsters.”
 “After that, this monk who listened to Great Emperor Shakyamuni’s teachings left. There was no news of him anymore. But the Great Thunderclap Temple still kept his Thangka, hoping to warn the future generations not to learn from him,” Monk Anan explained.
 Lin Jiufeng remembered it in his heart. He took another deep look at the Thangka before turning around and walking into the real Great Thunderclap Temple.
 Although the Great Thunderclap Temple was currently buried by the sand, the interior of the Great Thunderclap Temple was still filled with secrets.
 Buddhist teachings and principles were found with every step they walked.
 There were all sorts of Thangkas depicting Buddhist Bodhisattvas, Buddhas, and 3,000 believers listening to Great Emperor Shakyamuni preach the Dao.
 All these combined made up the true Great Thunderclap Temple.
 All sorts of teaching could be found here.
 Monk Anan led Lin Jiufeng and Ouyang Xiu to a new place.
 “I brought you guys here to see the true statue of Great Emperor Shakyamuni. It was established 100,000 years ago!” Monk Anan introduced proudly.
 It wasn’t easy for a statue from 100,000 years ago to still be preserved until now.
 In the entire Great Thunderclap Temple, there was only this one statue.
 The others were destroyed in different eras.
 Hence, such a statue appeared to be very precious.
 Lin Jiufeng’s eyes lit up. His interest was piqued. This was a statue from 100,000 years ago.
 Perhaps when this statue was set up back then, Great Emperor Shakyamuni had seen it himself too.
 Such an opportunity was rare.
 How could Lin Jiufeng miss this opportunity? He urged Monk Anan to be faster.
 They passed through the initial parts of the Great Thunderclap Temple and entered a mountain stream.
 The mountain stream was a triangle that spread outward.
 In the center of the triangle, a huge Buddha statue that was a thousand meters tall was calmly looking at this world.
 A statue of Great Emperor Shakyamuni!
 And it was from 100,000 years ago.
 Only some of the colors had fallen off. They were no longer as bright as before. Now, there was more of a sense of returning to the basics.
 Stepping onto this huge mountain stream, Ouyang Xiu looked at the thousand-meter Buddha statue and suddenly said, “I sensed it.”
 Monk Anan and Lin Jiufeng looked at him together.
 “The people of the Immortal Court are here. I really sensed them,” Ouyang Xiu said with a trembling voice.
 Lin Jiufeng asked with a serious expression, “Where?”
 Monk Anan also frowned as he watched.
 Would there be anyone from the Immortal Court near the statue of Great Emperor Shakyamuni?
 Why didn’t he know about this?
 Ouyang Xiu pointed with his finger and said shakily, “He’s kneeling there.”
 Lin Jiufeng and Monk Anan looked over together.
 In front of the thousand-meter tall statue was a huge square. There were also some statues in the square.
 Some of these statues were humans, some were monsters, and their expressions were different. Some had ferocious expressions, some had gentle expressions, some were in despair, and some were crying.
 These statues were lifelike. Looking at them from afar, one really couldn’t distinguish them as statues. Only by sensing the cold stone could one confirm that these were statues.
 As for Ouyang Xiu, he pointed at the person from the Immortal Court.
 Among these statues, there was only one that knelt down, looking ashamed.
 “Is this statue someone from the Immortal Court?” Lin Jiufeng asked softly.
 This was a little out of his expectations.
 “Yes, he’s a quasi-immortal King of the Immortal Court, a former friend of mine who’s both like a teacher and friend.” Ouyang Xiu nodded. He was similarly shocked.
 What exactly happened?
 Why was his former friend now kneeling in front of the statue of Great Emperor Shakyamuni?

Mo Xiu
At Shun City First High School.
In the classroom of Year 3 Class 1…
“There are still more than ten days left until the college entrance examination. Everyone must revise their theoretical knowledge, especially those who have yet to awaken their abilities. You must thoroughly research the theories behind your abilities. However, the awakened students must not be careless either. The college entrance examination will really determine a person’s fate.”
A man dressed in black was standing at the podium. He was Gao Quan, the form teacher of Year 3 Class 1.
Unlike the other relaxed students, Mo Xiu’s eyes were filled with seriousness and determination.
After all, Mo Xiu knew that the college entrance examination might not be that important to those with good family backgrounds.
However, to him, this was an opportunity to change his fate, an opportunity that he had no choice but to seize.
Gao Quan continued, “We will start self-studying until noon. After lunch, we will train at the training grounds.”
After Gao Quan finished speaking, he turned and left. Some of the students started chatting when they saw the form teacher leaving.
“Hey, have you guys heard? Zhou Qiuwu from Class Two awakened his skills yesterday. It’s said that he awakened two skills.”
“Really? Two skills? That’s too strong. He’s pulling away from us. Do you know what skills he has?”
“Of course, he’s from a prestigious family. There’s no need to talk about his talent. Anyway, are you an idiot? Who wouldn’t keep their skills a secret?”
“True, true!”
Mo Xiu ignored the students around him. Instead, he began to revise the curriculum from his first year of high school, which included the origins of skills, and the basic analysis of these skills.
He flipped to the first page of his notes, which detailed the origins of skills.
“Skills are a special gift bestowed upon humans by the heavens. A meteor landed on Earth, and the meteor emitted a huge light. Then, invisible radiation swept across the entire world, creating the current world. That meteor was named ‘The Beginning’, and it is now being kept by the Sea Race…”
On the second page…
“From then on, humans were bestowed with extraordinary abilities, which are currently known as the four skills. Everyone has four skills. On the day of their 18th birthday, they will awaken their first skill. After that, they will awaken one skill every year.”
These game-like abilities landed on Earth, and Earth underwent a tremendous change.
Mo Xiu’s birthday was tomorrow, and he had yet to awaken his abilities. If the college entrance examination could change his fate, then awakening would decide his fate.
The strength and use of one’s skills directly determined the direction of a person’s future development.
Therefore, when his 18th birthday was approaching, he was filled with anxiety.
Unknowingly, the afternoon bell rang.
Ring ring ring…
“Hey! Mo Xiu, stop reading. It’s time to eat. Are you really going to start revising your theoretical knowledge from scratch?”
The person who spoke was Zheng Yi, Mo Xiu’s only friend in high school.
Mo Xiu calmly closed his book and smiled calmly. “Why not?”
Zheng Yi was stunned for a moment before saying, “That’s up to you. Let’s go and eat!”
Then, the two of them went to the canteen to eat. The moment they sat down, Zheng Yi sneakily whispered into Mo Xiu’s ear.
“Mo Xiu, there’s a gathering tonight. Come with me.”
As Mo Xiu ate, he glanced at Zheng Yi and shook his head. “No, I have to train at the training grounds tonight.”
Zheng Yi pursed his lips and said, “How boring. Mu Qingyi will be attending this gathering as well. Don’t say that I won’t help you.”
Mu Qingyi was the class monitor. With Mo Xiu, they were the two most hardworking people in the entire class.
The two of them were usually the last to leave the school, so they usually had some interactions.
When Zheng Yi saw that Mo Xiu seemed to be very close to Mu Qingyi, he decided to play the role of a matchmaker.
“I won’t go no matter who goes!”
“You’re practically a block of wood.”
…
At the training grounds of Shun City First High School.
“Ah! So handsome! Mo Xiu has broken the speed record again!”
“That’s right, that’s right. He finished this 100-meter race in 7.65 seconds. Oh my god, could this be a school record?”
“The two of you, stop being love-struck. Can’t you see Mo Xiu’s face? Don’t even think about it.”
A group of girls were discussing Mo Xiu.
The college entrance examination was divided into three categories. The first was a theory test, the second was a physical test, and the third was a skill test.
There was no need to explain the theory test. It would test the knowledge they had learned from their textbooks.
The physical test included a strength test, a speed test, and a combat test.
Meanwhile, the skill test involved using a computer-simulated enemy to test the usage and strength of one’s skills.
There was no need for Mo Xiu to worry about the first two categories. After all, he was first in school for the theory component, while the results of his physical test were even better.
There was a saying in Shun City First High School. The results of the physical test could be divided into three grades. The top grade was Mo Xiu, the second grade was empty, while the rest of the school was in the third grade.
The only thing Mo Xiu was worried about was the skill test. Time was too tight, and there were only ten days left until the college entrance examination.
There would be very little time to figure out his own skills.
“I ran 100 meters in 7.65 seconds, and my fist power is 230.4 kilograms. I have to work harder. Since I don’t know my skills. I have to improve my results in the two other tests as much as possible.”
Then, an abrupt and arrogant voice broke the silence.
“Mo Xiu, do you dare to compete with me?”
The newcomer was called Wang Xuanhu. He was in the same class as Mo Xiu, and his results had always been suppressed by Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi. It could be said that he was firmly in third place.
As he had been below Mo Xiu all year round, he was very unhappy.
He couldn’t stand how arrogant Mo Xiu had always been. Coincidentally, there were many people paying attention to Mo Xiu today, so he wanted to use this opportunity to embarrass Mo Xiu.
“Compete in what?”
“Compete in actual combat, of course. The college entrance examination is about actual combat. It’s not easy to find an opponent to train with, right?”
Mo Xiu thought for a moment. Indeed, he did not have much combat experience. Thus, he agreed without any hesitation.
The two of them arrived at a square-shaped field with a length and width of 25 meters. The official way to determine the winner was to either leave the boundaries of the field or fall to the ground.
Mo Xiu’s physique was terrifying, and no one had dared to challenge him throughout his three years of high school. Hence, this match had attracted a large number of onlookers.
At this moment, Zheng Yi squeezed into the crowd. When he saw someone challenging Mo Xiu, his interest was piqued.
He shouted, “Wang Xuanhu, are you itching for a beating?”
Zheng Yi wasn’t being arrogant by saying that. In a competition where skills weren’t used, Mo Xiu was invincible.
“Shall we begin?”
Mo Xiu said as he stretched out a hand and made an inviting gesture.
Wang Xuanhu did not answer. Instead, he took a big stride forward and accelerated towards Mo Xiu.
Zheng Yi shouted despicably from among the audience.
The two of them were not far from each other to begin with. Thus, Wang Xuanhu’s sudden attack had caught Mo Xiu off guard.
However, Mo Xiu’s expression was calm without a trace of panic. He exerted strength in his legs and advanced instead of retreating. Then, he arrived at Wang Xuanhu’s right in a flash and punched him in the stomach.
“Ah!”
Wang Xuanhu fell to the ground in pain. After a while, seeing that Mo Xiu did not continue attacking, he slowly stood up.
The audience started discussing. Most people felt that the gap between the two was too great and that Wang Xuanhu would definitely lose.
Wang Xuanhu lowered his head and seemed to be thinking about something. Then, he launched another attack.
This time, Wang Xuanhu dodged Mo Xiu’s kick.
Wang Xuanhu, who had dodged the attack, did not continue attacking. Instead, he grabbed Mo Xiu’s leg.
Mo Xiu would not let go of this opportunity and punched Wang Xuanhu’s chest.
Just when everyone thought that the match had ended, Wang Xuanhu flashed a sinister smile.
“First skill, Burst Sting!”
As everyone watched on in disbelief, spikes suddenly grew out of Wang Xuanhu’s body.
At this moment, it was impossible for Mo Xuesha to retract his fist. He could only make a clawing gesture with his hands to minimize the damage.
His hand firmly grabbed onto the spikes on Wang Xuanhu’s body. Then, Mo Xiu borrowed the force and pulled out his left leg to retreat.
Although Mo Xiu was prepared, he was still heavily injured. His left leg and right hand had been pierced by the spikes.
Zheng Yi rushed into the arena and said angrily to Wang Xuanhu, “Wang Xuanhu, you actually used your skill. How shameless. I’ll let you have a taste of suffering today.”
Wang Xuanhu had actually used a skill! Usually, both parties would tacitly agree not to use a skill in a competition. If they wanted to use a skill, they had to say so in advance.
Everyone knew that Mo Xiu had not awakened a single skill, so this was a deliberate trap by Wang Xuanhu.
The surrounding people also began to talk about how shameless Wang Xuanhu was. However, no one noticed that Mo Xiu was looking at his wound with excitement in his eyes.
Zheng Yi was about to charge forward when Mo Xiu grabbed him and shook his head, indicating for him not to.
Zheng Yi whispered, “Mo Xiu, how can you tolerate this? I’ll take responsibility if anything happens.”
Mo Xiu pulled Zheng Yi behind him and walked to Wang Xuanhu step by step. He extended a hand and said, “Let’s continue. How about it?”
“Ah?!”
The entire audience cried out in surprise. He was already in this state, yet he still wanted to continue?
Wang Xuanhu was stunned and did not speak.
“Right! You can use your skills!”
…
“Ah?!!!”


                    



Lesson
Everyone was shocked. No one could understand what Mo Xiu was trying to do.
The other party was obviously trying to make Mo Xiu look bad. Thus, Mo Xiu could totally let everyone teach Wang Xuanhu a lesson.
Although Mo Xiu didn’t have many good friends, he was quite a good person. In addition, he was strong and had some prestige in the class. As long as he spoke, the others would be willing to help.
However, Mo Xiu wanted to continue fighting with Wang Xuanhu. This not only meant that he had forgiven Wang Xuanhu, but that he also wanted to make things difficult for him.
In everyone’s opinion, it was impossible for Mo Xiu to defeat Wang Xuanhu without any skills.
Wang Xuanhu was overjoyed when he realized what was going on. He did not expect Mo Xiu to be so stupid. Initially, he could not stand his bragging and wanted him to suffer.
However, if the competition were to continue, Mo Xiu would not only suffer.
“Alright, since you’ve invited me so sincerely, I’ll accept it.”
Mo Xiu did not react after hearing this. Instead, he nodded seriously.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi was furious. Wang Xuanhu was so shameless that he wanted to beat him up.
“Are you f*cking shameless? I’m going to teach you a lesson today. I’m going to make you cry.”
Mo Xiu pulled Zheng Yi back and said in a low voice, “Leave it to me. There are many ways to teach someone a lesson. Do you think I’m someone who will swallow my pride?”
Upon hearing Mo Xiu’s words, Zheng Yi calmed down and walked out of the venue. He wanted to see what Mo Xiu was up to.
At most, he would help when Mo Xiu was no match for Wang Xuanhu.
Then, Mo Xiu turned around and said to Wang Xuanhu, “Let’s begin!”
Wang Xuanhu sat on the ground and said, “Wait a moment. I’ve used a lot of energy in the competition just now. Let’s rest for a while before we begin.”
The onlookers were dumbfounded. Did he say that he used a lot of energy just now? They had only exchanged three moves. Wang Xuanhu had only suffered one punch while Mo Xiu was still bleeding.
However, Mo Xiu did not mind. He sat on the ground and looked meaningfully at Wang Xuanhu.
“Alright!”
…
Mo Xiu kept staring at Wang Xuanhu, not knowing what to think.
This was until Wang Xuanhu said that he was done resting and the competition resumed.
Wang Xuanhu stood up arrogantly and said, “Come on, let’s begin!”
This time, Mo Xiu did not act as politely as before. Instead, he immediately attacked after Wang Xuanhu finished speaking.
The strength that erupted from his legs was extremely shocking. He instantly threw a punch at Wang Xuanhu’s face.
Wang Xuanhu knew how powerful Mo Xiu was, so he did not dare to be negligent and protected his head with his arms.
“First skill, Burst Sting!”
Wang Xuanhu’s entire body was covered in spikes once again. However,Mo Xiu was clearly well-prepared this time. He transformed his fist into a knife hand strike and slashed at the gap between the two spikes on Wang Xuanhu’s arm.
Pa!
After Mo Xiu’s attack succeeded, he immediately retreated. Wang Xuanhu lowered his arms and said with a grin, “Haha, do you think you’ve found my weakness?”
Mo Xiu acted as if he did not hear Wang Xuanhu’s words and muttered to himself, “So that’s how it is.”
“Mo Xiu, what did you say?!”
“Nothing. Again!”
Before he could finish his sentence, Mo Xiu attacked again. His hand was still prepared for a knife hand strike, but he no longer delivered a chop. Instead, he used his fingertips to attack the gaps in Wang Xuanhu’s spikes. This way, he could ensure that he was not injured.
Wang Xuanhu was not someone to be trifled with. After all, he was not weak to begin with. Furthermore, with the augmentation of his skill, although he did not injure Mo Xiu, he had the upper hand after a few moves.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu relied on his nimble movements to fight and retreat. In an instant, the two of them were locked in battle.
Outside of the field, Zheng Yi frowned. Mo Xiu’s seemingly disorganized moves had a pattern to them that he was very familiar with.
At this moment, a voice from behind reminded Zheng Yi, “Do you think Mo Xiu is using
Baguazhang
?”
Zheng Yi slapped his thigh. That was right. Wasn’t Mo Xiu using Baguazhang, which was taught in the basic martial arts class in Year 1.
Mo Xiu turned Baguazhang into a knife hand strike and used his fingertips to attack. He was extremely strong and his legs were steady like in Baguazhang. Furthermore, his movements were unpredictable. Wasn’t this the same as Baguazhang?
It was as if the question in Zheng Yi’s heart had been answered. This sentence also solved the doubts of all the bystanders. For a moment, there was silence.
Oh my god, how solid were Mo Xiu’s fundamentals? To think that a basic martial arts technique that everyone despised could be used to such an extent.
At this moment, the most depressed person was Wang Xuanhu. He no longer had the confidence he had at the beginning of the competition. Instead, his brows were tightly furrowed and his expression was solemn.
He had thought that he could easily defeat Mo Xiu and humiliate him, but he hadn’t expected that he would only be able to fight to a draw even after using a skill.
Suddenly, Wang Xuanhu’s spikes disappeared. Then, Mo Xiu’s right hand transformed into a fist and punched at Wang Xuanhu’s face.
“I admit defeat!!!”
Mo Xiu’s fist stopped five centimeters away from Wang Xuanhu, who let out a long sigh.
“Phew! I admit defeat this time. I’ll consult you again next time!”
With that said, he turned to leave. At this moment, Zheng Yi ran over and said, “Mo Xiu, are you letting him go just like that? When he plotted against you, if it weren’t for your quick reflexes, you might not have just suffered such serious injuries. It might even affect your college entrance examination. If you’re afraid that it will affect you, I’ll go and deal with him.”
“He has already received his due punishment.”
Zheng Yi frowned and asked, “What punishment?”
Wang Xuanhu, who was walking away, walked back when he heard this.
Then, he regained his initial arrogance and said, “Tell me, how did you punish me?”
Mo Xiu smiled and remained calm. He ignored Wang Xuanhu’s mockery.
Instead, Mo Xiu walked step by step to Wang Xuanhu’s side and gently patted his shoulder.
Wang Xuanhu slapped Mo Xiu’s hand away and said, “Stop trying to mystify things. Speak! What the hell are you doing?!”
Mo Xiu’s voice was not too loud or too soft. He used a volume that was just enough for the surrounding crowd to hear him. He said, “Wang Xuanhu, first skill: Burst Sting. A release-type skill. His entire body will be covered in spikes. Furthermore, it increases his speed, strength, and defense by about 20%. Duration: 45 seconds. Cooldown: 30 minutes.”
Wang Xuanhu looked at Mo Xiu in disbelief. Everything Mo Xiu said was right. How… how was this possible?
The surrounding people were in an uproar. Such a detailed introduction of Wang Xuanhu’s skill would definitely affect his future development.
Everyone only had four skills and everyone would try their best to hide their skills.
This was because if two people were to fight, and one didn’t know their opponent’s skill but the opponent knew their skill, their opponent would come up with a strategy based on the characteristics of their skill. Unless one absolutely suppressed their opponent in terms of strength, it was almost impossible to defeat their opponent.
This was a very detailed introduction that even included the cooldown time. This was a heavy blow to Wang Xuanhu.
No school would take a fancy to a person who had the details of their skill fully exposed just after they had awakened their skill.
At this moment, Wang Xuanhu’s entire body was trembling as he said, “You… Even if you can estimate that the skill will improve my attributes, then… How do you know the cooldown time and duration of my skill? You’re talking nonsense, right! You’re talking nonsense!”
Mo Xiu replied with interest, “After the first round ended, the spikes on your body did not disappear. This means that your skill cannot be automatically deactivated. Therefore, during the second round, the period of time between when you release your skill to the end of your skill will be the duration of your skill!”
“What about the cooldown time?”
“Didn’t you say that you wanted to rest for a while? I’ve been watching you. With your desire to fight immediately back then, the time between when the spikes on your body retracted to the time you said you could continue fighting is the cooldown time!”
After hearing Mo Xiu’s analysis, Wang Xuanhu could not stay any longer and left in a hurry.
Mo Xiu had been ambushed and calmly proposed to continue the competition. Then, he had used the basic Baguazhang techniques to fight Wang Xuanhu to a standstill. Finally, he had used such meticulous calculations to predict Wang Xuanhu’s skill.
However, Mo Xiu’s plan to train at the training grounds after school was disrupted. Now that he was injured, he could only go home and rest.
This was also one of the reasons why Mo Xiu was angry. Another reason was that, as Zheng Yi had said, Wang Xuanhu wanted to affect his college entrance examination.
When he got home, there were dishes on the dining table and a piece of paper under the plates.
“I’m working the night shift today. Eat well and don’t miss me!”
Mo Xiu’s mother’s name was Li Yuan. She worked at a small factory. It was not easy for the mother and son to live in this chaotic world. In order to earn more money, her mother often worked overtime at night. Thus, Mo Xiu had not seen her for a few days.
Mo Xiu had witnessed the family situation and his mother’s hard work. This was also the reason why he had been working so hard to learn and train.
After dinner, he lay on the bed and quietly waited for the clock to strike midnight.
As long as the clock struck midnight, Mo Xiu would awaken one of his skills. Thus, he was extremely nervous.
“What exactly will my first skill be? The books say that when it’s my birthday, three skills will appear in my mind. I can choose one of them as my skill. What will mine be?”
Perhaps it was because he was too tired from the battle, or perhaps it was because he was too nervous. Mo Xiu fell asleep.
When it was almost midnight, Li Yuan returned home. After all, it was her son’s birthday at midnight. At the same time, her son was going to awaken his skills.
No matter what, she had to come back to accompany her son.
Seeing that Mo Xiu was already asleep, she sat by the bed to accompany him.
Li Yuan looked at Mo Xiu apologetically.
She had seen Mo Xiu’s hard work all these years. Although she was earning money to support her family, Li Yuan knew that the amount of hard work that Mo Xiu had put in was no less than hers.
Mo Xiu wanted to change his fate and his mother’s fate.
At midnight…
A huge wave of energy crashed into Mo Xiu’s mind, causing him to wake up with a start. After that, his gaze became dull.
During an awakening, the brain would be in a blank state and would not sense anything from the outside world.
Li Yuan became nervous when she saw this. She knew that the awakening had begun.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu nervously looked at the skill pattern in his mind that was floating over from afar.
As the pattern got closer, Mo Xiu began to realize that something was wrong. Why was there only one pattern? Could it be that he couldn’t choose?
The pattern became clear, and Mo Xiu focused his gaze.
“Passive Skill: Flip.”
???
“What is a passive skill?”


a type of Chinese martial art of the Wudang school



                    



Awakening
A passive skill? What was that? It hadn’t been recorded in the books throughout his three years of high school. No one had mentioned it.
When the skill pattern appeared, Mo Xiu was even more confused.
There was only one pattern with the word “Flip” written on it. Even the skill introduction was nowhere to be found.
The books clearly stated that when a person awakened their skills, they would be in a special state. In the outside world, a person would be in a blank state, but in reality, their brain would be operating rapidly, and they would be choosing their skills.
The three subsequent awakenings would be the same. Three skill patterns would appear in one’s mind, and the names and introduction of the skills would be displayed.
However, only one pattern appeared in Mo Xiu’s mind. There was no choice to make, and there was no introduction. This meant that Mo Xiu didn’t know what this skill was used for.
Even in such a situation, Mo Xiu was still very calm. There was no time limit to choosing a skill during an awakening, so Mo Xiao wanted to wait and see if things would take a turn for the better.
Mo Xiu didn’t know how long he had been waiting in this awakening state, where he had no sense of the flow of time. Everything in front of him remained the same. Meanwhile, the ‘Flip’ skill was looking at him coldly.
“I don’t know how much time has passed in the outside world. I can’t drag this on any longer. If my skill is going to be ‘Flip’, then so be it!”
Mo Xiu was helpless and could only force himself to choose this skill.
When he came into contact with the skill pattern, the skill transformed into a golden light and surged into his mind.
Just as Mo Xun wanted to check this skill, he realized that he could not control his body.
In other words, he had yet to escape from this state of awakening. What was going on?
Amidst his confusion, another light appeared before his eyes. As the light approached him, three patterns appeared.
Hm? Was the choice just now fake? Had the awakening just begun?
When the three skill patterns came to a stop, Mo Xiu carefully examined them.
“Skill: Infinite Exploding Flames.”
“Effect: Summons explosive flames.”
“Cooldown: 5 minutes.”
“Skill: God’s Eye.”
“Effect: Checks the approximate skill effect, as well as the detailed cooldown and duration of the target’s skills. It can only be used on one target.”
“Cooldown: 1 hour.”
“Skill: Descent of the Martial God.”
“Effect: Increases all attributes (speed, strength, endurance, etc.) by 100%.”
“Duration: 3 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
Even when an accident happened, he didn’t panic. However, after seeing these three skills, Mo Xiu couldn’t remain calm anymore.
“Hm? Aren’t these skills too powerful?”
After exclaiming in surprise, Mo Xiu fell into deep thought. These three skills were too powerful. Each had their own advantages.
Infinite Bursting Flames had a short cooldown time. Although the effect of the skill did not specify how powerful it was, it should not be too bad. Generally, such explosive skills that could cover a range would have a long cooldown time.
Having a short cooldown meant that he could use multiple deadly skills in a battle.
Meanwhile, Descent of the Martial God was easier to understand. It was used to increase one’s attributes. The 100% increase in all of his attributes was very scary. Usually, buff-type skills that had just been awakened would only improve one attribute, such as speed. Furthermore, the increase in attributes would not be that large.
As for God’s Eye, it was the skill that shocked Mo Xiu the most. He had never heard of a skill that could directly check the skills of others. Just like Wang Hu’s skill, maintaining the secrecy of one’s skills was very important.
If he knew his opponent’s skills before the battle, he would have a higher chance of winning.
After hesitating for a while, Mo Xiu prepared to choose between God’s Eye and Descent of the Martial God.
God’s Eye was simply cheating. Mo Xiu didn’t want to let go of this skill.
On the other hand, Descent of the Martial God could increase his strength in a short period of time. Mo Xiu had been studying combat since he was young. Thus, this skill was very suitable for him.
One of the skills provided him with special privileges, but it would be much help to him in the college entrance examination. Meanwhile, the other skill could help him achieve good results in the college entrance examination.
This was a question of whether to choose a skill that would help him in the present or the future.
After hesitating for a while, Mo Xiu still decided to choose Descent of the Martial God. It would be more helpful.
After his consciousness touched the skill, the skill that contained Descent of the Martial God also turned into golden light and entered his mind.
After making his choice, the patterns of the other two skills didn’t disappear. Mo Xiu furrowed his eyebrows.
What was going on? Why were there so many strange things happening when he awakened his skills?
Could it be that there was something wrong with the skills and he couldn’t choose Descent of the Martial God?
Mo Xiu shook his head and used his consciousness to touch God’s Eye.
This time, before the golden light dissipated, everything before Mo Xiue turned white. Then, he opened his eyes.
This… What had happened? This awakening felt like a dream.
Mo Xiu suddenly sat up and concentrated. Then, two images appeared in his mind.
One of them was Flip, while the other was God’s Eye.
“Hm? What’s going on? Why do I have two skills? Did I also awaken two skills at once? No, according to the records, if there are multiple skills during the first awakening, the entire awakening process will be split into two parts. After choosing the first skill, I will wake up. Then, I will enter the state of awakening again within a day.”
“Little Xiu, are you awake?”
A voice interrupted Mo Xiu’s thoughts. He looked up and saw that it was his mother.
Mo Xiu did not wake up the entire night, and Li Yuan stayed by his side the entire night.
“Have you awakened your skills?”
“Yes!”
“Are the skills okay?”
“They’re not bad.”
“That’s good. Get up and eat. I’ll make you a bowl of longevity noodles.”
His mother didn’t ask any more questions. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu didn’t say anything because he knew his mother believed he could handle everything.
After briefly tidying up, Mo Xiu came to the dining table and looked at the simple bowl of longevity noodles, feeling a little touched.
All these years, his mother had been supporting this family alone, so it was very difficult to earn money.
Once he went to university, he would get a scholarship and do some part-time jobs to earn money.
“Mom, thank you!”
Li Yuan smiled and said, “Rascal, why are you being so polite with your mother?”
Mo Xiu scratched his head and said, “Hehe, thank you very much.”
Not long after his meal, Mo Xiu left. Although he was looking forward to testing his skills, he still had to go to school today. Thus, he couldn’t find a quiet place to study his skills.
When Mo Xiu reached the school gate, he bumped into Zheng Yi. Mo Xiu was a little puzzled. This fellow was always the last to arrive. Why was he here so early today?
“Morning, Zheng Yi. Did the sun rise from the west today? You’re early.”
Zheng Yi said unhappily, “You’re so heartless. I know that it’s your birthday and day of awakening, so I came early to wait for you. Hey! How’s your skill?”
In this era, everyone knew the importance of hiding their skills. Thus, Zheng Yi didn’t directly ask Mo Xiu what his skill was, but rather what it was for.
Mo Xiu paused for a moment before saying, “Not bad, but it won’t be of much help to the college entrance examination.”
“Oh? Does that mean that it’s not a combat skill? Out of 100 points, how many points will you give your own skill?”
“I would give it 95 points.”
Zheng Yi was rather surprised. He knew Mo Xiu well. Although Mo Xiu usually joked around, he was very serious when it came to things. A score of 95 points was not low.
It looked like Mo Xiu’s skill was pretty good. Zheng Yi was genuinely happy for Mo Xiu.
In reality, Mo Xiu did not hide anything. The reason why he gave it a score of 95 instead of 100 was because there were too many strange things during the awakening process. Thus, he was unable to determine the strength of the skill.
Oh right, wouldn’t it be fine if he tried using God’s Eye? He just didn’t know if it would have any effect when he used it.
With this thought in mind, Mo Xiu grabbed Zheng Yi’s arm and dragged him to the path beside the school.
“Hey, hey, hey, Mo Xiu, what are you doing?”
Mo Xiu looked at Zheng Yi seriously and said, “I’m sorry!”
After that, Mo Xiu used God’s Eye on Zheng Yi and a message appeared in Mo Xiu’s mind.
“First Skill: Purple Lightning.”
“Effect: After being released, the entire body will be enveloped by purple lightning. This skill increases speed by 100%. When attacking, there will be a paralyzing effect.”
“Duration: 2 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
He could really read other people’s skills with so much detail. This was incredible.
Mo Xiu suppressed the excitement in his heart and raised his head to look at Zheng Yi. “Was there anything strange about me just now? For example, did I emit any light?”
Zheng Yi said with a puzzled look, “No, why? Why are you asking such strange questions every now and then?”
Mo Xiu said, “Alright, class is starting soon. Let’s go back.”
Zheng Yi nodded and walked back.
However, Mo Xiu suddenly stopped after taking two steps, his eyes filled with shock.
This was because when Mo Xiu looked at the skill in his mind, the skill had changed. The name under the skill pattern was “Descent of the Martial God”.
???
Had his skill changed? Why? Could it be… Flip!!!


                    



I Can Read Through You
Zheng Yi, who was walking in front, was a little angry when he saw Mo Xiu stop in his tracks.
“Mo Xiu, why are you acting so strange today? Let’s go back to class.”
“Oh, I’ll be right there.”
When they returned to the classroom, since the college entrance examination was about to begin, they had to attend a self-study session in the morning. Then, they would go to the training grounds in the afternoon.
Mo Xiu sat in his seat in a daze as he carefully checked his skills.
The passive skill did not change at all. Meanwhile, God’s Eye was gone and had been replaced by Descent of the Martial God.
After thinking about it, Mo Xiu felt that there was a possibility that everything he saw when he awakened was real. He had indeed chosen three skills.
He had one passive skill and two active skills. Under normal circumstances, only one active skill could be seen, and the effect of the passive skill was to switch between the two active skills. However, the trigger conditions were unknown, and the active skills could not be automatically switched.
A passive skill? What exactly was a passive skill?
Mo Xiu suddenly got up and ran out of the classroom to the library.
The third-year students could also choose to study in the library. However, the college entrance examination now emphasized on combat ability and the strength of their skills. Thus, there were typically not many people here.
Throughout the entire morning, Mo Xiu read through many books, but he couldn’t find any records regarding passive skills.
The only skills mentioned that were similar to his passive skill were the skills of beasts.
Beasts did not have four skills like humans. They only had one skill, but it had a high growth rate.
Ever since the meteorite landed in the human world, both humans and animals had mutated. Their physical abilities had increased significantly, and they had developed skills. In addition, the intelligence of animals had increased significantly, and they had been fighting with other creatures for more than ten years.
In the end, both parties signed an agreement to not interfere with each other. Humans lived in the center of the continent while animals lived in the periphery.
Although there would be occasional conflicts, such conflicts were just isolated phenomena. There would not be large-scale wars. This was also the reason why humans were living rather comfortably.
After a fruitless search, Mo Xiu sat on the chair dejectedly. What should he do? Passive skills had never appeared before, so how could he trigger the Flip skill again?
“Hello, student, I noticed that you have been reading many books here. Do you have any doubts?”
Mo Xiu’s thoughts were interrupted by a sudden elderly voice. He looked up and saw that it was the librarian who usually stayed in the library.
“Ah, hello. There are indeed some things that I can’t figure out.”
The old man slowly sat down and took the book from Mo Xiu’s hands. He closed it and placed it under his palm.
“Tell me about it. I’ve been here for ten years and am familiar with every individual here.”
Individual? Shouldn’t they be all books?
Mo Xiu was puzzled, but he still asked his question. “May I ask what types of skills there are?”
The old man slowly said, “Skills are divided into release-type skills, state-type skills, one-time skills and variant-type skills.”
“Oh, what about the larger categories?”
Mo Xiu obviously wouldn’t directly ask if this man knew what a passive skill was. He could only ask bit by bit.
“There are attack-type skills, detection-type skills, confusion-type skills, and special-type skills.”
“What about the even larger categories?”
“There are skills that can grow, and skills that cannot grow.”
“Even larger!”
“You! What exactly do you want to ask?”
Mo Xiu stood up and scratched his head. “Nothing. I was just asking. I’m leaving. Sorry for disturbing you!”
“I can read through you.”
Mo Xiu didn’t understand what the old man meant. He could only smile, nod, and retreat.
“Skills are divided into ordinary skills and innate skills. Innate skills are not only possessed by wild beasts, but also by some humans. For example… The royalty!”
Mo Xiu, who was walking away, paused when he heard this. This old man was definitely not simple.
At this thought, Mo Xiu quickened his pace.
Meanwhile, the old man watched as Mo Xiu left, the corners of his lips curling up as if he had discovered something interesting.
…
After Mo Xiu came out of the library, he had a simple meal before heading to the training grounds. He wanted to test out the Descent of the Martial God skill when there were fewer people in the training grounds.
The innate skill that the old man mentioned might be a passive skill, but how could he be a member of the royal family? If he couldn’t figure it out, he might as well not think about it anymore.
When he arrived at the training grounds, it was unknown if it was because the college entrance examination was approaching or if it was just a coincidence, but it was already crowded at noon.
Since he was already here, Mo Xiu could only carry out his normal training. Furthermore, Descent of the Martial God increased all his attributes by 100%. The higher his base attributes were, the stronger his abilities would be after he used his skill.
When he arrived at the specially-made treadmill, Mo Xiu prepared to train his speed and endurance to the point of exhaustion as usual. Then, he would rest for a period of time before continuing to train his strength.
Mo Xiu had concluded that this method could allow him to stimulate his potential and break through his limits.
However, before Mo Xiu could start training, he saw Zheng Yi running over unhappily.
“I say, Mo Xiu, aren’t you too mean? Why did you run away after attending the self-study session? I’ve been looking everywhere for you but I couldn’t find you.”
Mo Xiu awkwardly said, “I went to the library to look up some information and forgot to tell you.”
Zheng Yi put his hands on his waist and said, “It’s alright. I’m a magnanimous person. I forgive you…”
“Bang!!!”
Before Zheng Yi could finish, there was a loud bang from the ceiling.
There was a huge hole in the alloy ceiling of the training grounds. Then, a three-meter-tall shadow fell from the sky along with the dust.
As the dust settled, everyone present exclaimed.
“Heavens, is… Is this a ferocious beast?”
This was indeed a ferocious beast, a huge creature similar to an eagle. It stood at the center of the training grounds, giving off an invisible pressure.
Mo Xiu frowned and said, “This is a Demonic Eagle. It has two forms and hasn’t entered combat mode. Run!”
Mo Xiu’s voice grew louder and louder. When he said the word ‘run’ at the end, he practically roared.
Upon hearing Mo Xiu’s warning, everyone reacted and immediately ran towards the door.
Mo Xiu had seen this species in a book before. Its name was the Demonic Eagle. It had a violent nature and its skill was transformation.
Demonic Eagles had two forms. The first form was its flight form, where its attack power was slightly lower.
The other was the form after transformation. Its wings would be retracted back into its body and replaced by two strong front limbs. After transformation, the Demonic Eagle’s strength would increase and it would become bloodthirsty.
Even with Mo Xiu’s reminder, everyone still took too long to react. At this moment, the Demonic Eagle’s black wings were gone and were replaced by a pair of blood-red forelimbs.
The Demonic Eagle took a step forward and was as fast as lightning. In an instant, it arrived at the door and blocked everyone’s path.
Everyone panicked and looked at Mo Xiu. However, they didn’t expect Mo Xiu to defeat the Demonic Eagle. They simply looked at Mo Xiu as he had just recognized it.
Mo Xiu lowered his head slightly and threw his jacket to the ground.
“Let’s fight!!!”


                    



A Matter of Life and Death
Mo Xiu wasn’t trying to be a hero, nor was he going back on his word. He had just told everyone to run, and now he was telling them to fight.
Just now, he wanted to take advantage of the fact that the Demonic Eagle had yet to enter its battle form to escape. However, the Demonic Eagle was already blocking the entrance. It seemed like it would not be able to get far away from there. If they tried to escape, it would only cause chaos and cause more damage.
What they needed to do now was to hold the Demonic Eagle back. Such a huge commotion would definitely alert the teachers. They could only resolve this crisis when the teachers arrived.
However, before Mo Xiu could rush over to fight, the Demonic Eagle made its move. With a sweep of its huge arm, it sent the students who had reached the exit flying.
In the end, the Demonic Eagle grabbed one of the girls and wanted to put her into its mouth.
Mo Xiu shouted, “Not good!” Then, he simply activated Descent of the Martial God and charged forward at full speed.
Mo Xiu wasn’t a saint, but if a classmate lost his life before his eyes and he didn’t lend a helping hand, he would still feel bad.
Originally, Mo Xiu’s physique was already astonishing. With the augmentation of his skill, he was as fast as lightning and instantly arrived in front of Demonic Eagle.
What surprised Mo Xiu was that even with his full strength, there were still two people ahead of him.
One of them was Zheng Yi, who was surrounded by purple electric currents. The other was a young man that Mo Xiu didn’t recognize. He wore glasses and was very thin. He didn’t look like someone who could burst out with such speed.
Zheng Yi’s fist was surrounded with purple lightning as he punched the arm of the Demonic Eagle, which was holding onto a student. It was obvious that Demonic Eagle’s arm had slowed down.
As for the bespectacled youth, he was even more exaggerated. The muscles all over his body instantly swelled up. At this moment, one could no longer tell that he was thin and weak. His muscles were even more exaggerated than those of a bodybuilder.
Then, he jumped up high and grabbed onto the Demonic Eagle’s wrist. With a bit of strength, he pulled the Demonic Eagle’s entire arm to the ground.
The Demonic Eagle was clearly surprised that a human could possess such power. However, it only paused for a moment before raising its arm.
After exerting such strength, the bespectacled youth was clearly struggling. Meanwhile, Zheng Yi continued to strike the Demonic Eagle’s arm to reduce the pressure on the bespectacled youth.
However, the two of them only lasted for less than a second as the Demonic Eagle’s strength was too great. The bespectacled youth was already lifted up. Then, the Demonic Eagle’s other arm swung over, ready to deal the bespectacled youth a fatal blow.
It was a matter of life and death! Zheng Yi panicked and threw another punch, shouting, “Mo Xiu!!!”
Zheng Yi naturally saw Mo Xiu rushing over and could only seek help from Mo Xiu.
In reality, Mo Xiu had not been idle during this period of time. Instead, he had taken the opportunity when Demonic Eagle’s attention was completely on Zheng Yi and the bespectacled youth to sneak around to Demonic Eagle’s side.
Just as Demonic Eagle lifted up the bespectacled youth, Mo Xiu moved. He leaped in front of Demonic Eagle and punched out with both fists like a cannonball. His target was the Demonic Eagle’s eyes.
Before the Demonic Eagle could react, Mo Xiu’s two punches landed squarely on its eyes.
“Ao!!!”
The Demonic Eagle retracted its hands to protect its eyes. Only then did Zheng Yi, the bespectacled youth, and the female student who had just been caught escape.
However, the Demonic Eagle was blocking the entrance and no one could escape.
Mo Xiu turned around and was shocked. The people behind him weren’t idle.
Instead, a few people with flying skills were helping to transport those with weaker combat abilities and those who had yet to reach the age of 18 and awaken their skills.
Their exit was the hole that the Demonic Eagle had smashed into the roof of the training grounds.
Those who could come here to train at this time were mostly those who had not awakened or felt that their skills were not ideal after their awakening.
At this moment, they were abnormally united. Everyone knew that Mo Xiu, Zheng Yi, and the bespectacled youth were the strongest people here.
Whether or not they could escape today depended on these three people. Therefore, some people organized themselves into groups. One team went to help the three of them, while the other team quickly transported the people who did not have combat power.
At this moment, Mo Xiu also understood that the situation was more serious than he had imagined. Descent of the Martial God could last for three minutes, while Zheng Yi’s Purple Lightning could last for two minutes.
Mo Xiu did not know what the skill of the bespectacled young man was. It seemed like it was a buff or transformation skill. There should be a time limit to his skill as well.
If the three strongest people wanted to stop the Demonic Eagle, they had to do the opposite of what they were doing now. They had to increase the tempo of their attacks and deal serious damage to the Demonic Eagle within the time limit.
“The two of you, attack the Demonic Eagle immediately and harass it as much as you can without getting hurt.”
When Zheng Yi and the bespectacled youth heard Mo Xiu’s words, they rushed forward without any hesitation.
Mo Xiu wanted to let the two of them stall the Demonic Eagle for a while as he looked for any weapons that could severely injure it.
When Mo Xiu saw how much time he had left, he was shocked again.
Descent of the Martial God had disappeared and God’s Eye appeared again. Could it be that the passive skill was a skill that automatically changed his active skill after he used his active skill?
This thought flashed through his mind. Now was not the time to think about this. Mo Xiu immediately turned around and activated his skill, God’s Eye, on the Demonic Eagle.
“Talent Skill: Enchantment.”
“Skill Effect: Retracts the wings from under one’s armpits and regrows one’s arms. Reduces speed by 50%, increases strength by 200%, and increases defense by 500% (with the exception of the wings under one’s armpits).”
This… This skill was simply abnormal. Not only was it powerful, but it also did not have a cooldown time and could be used at will.
Wait a minute, its defense had increased, except for the wing area under its armpits. This was equivalent to directly revealing the weakness of the Demonic Eagle.
“How awesome!”
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but sigh at how abnormal his skill was. He couldn’t help but blurt out, “How awesome.”
Zheng Yi, who was entangled with the Demonic Eagle, thought that Mo Xiu was praising him when he heard this. He actually grinned widely at Mo Xiu.
Zheng Yi’s expression seemed to say, “You think I’m awesome too, don’t you?”
Mo Xiu was helpless. Zheng Yi’s heart was too big. He could still show off in such a situation.
However, Zheng Yi only showed off for a moment before the purple lightning on his body disappeared. After the skill duration was up, he entered a cooldown state and his combat power was greatly reduced.
They could originally take the opportunity while the Demonic Eagle’s vision had not recovered to barely deal with the Demonic Eagle. Now, all the pressure was on the bespectacled youth.
Just as Mo Xiu was about to rush forward to save Zheng Yi, the people supporting him from the side swarmed forward and charged towards the Demonic Eagle.
Zheng Yi, who was unable to use his skill, also followed them.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu made a prompt decision. He picked up two barbells and charged forward.
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi had activated their skills together. Once Zheng Yi’s skill duration was up, he would only have one minute to prove himself. Thus, he had to hurry.
“Zheng Yi, Glasses, come here.”
Zheng Yi and the bespectacled youth came to Mo Xiu’s side.
Then, Mo Xiu whispered to them.
Zheng Yi did not say a word. Meanwhile, the bespectacled youth said, “It’s feasible, but are you confident that all of your moves will be accurate?”
Mo Xiu nodded seriously and said, “Yes, there’s no time. Let’s go!”
The three of them ran side by side towards the Demonic Eagle. When they were nearby, Zheng Yi suddenly sped up and squatted down in front of Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu’s foot landed on Zheng Yi’s back. It was unclear whether it was due to the strength of the kick or because Zheng Yi was exerting strength, but a loud shout resounded throughout the entire venue.
“Ah! Go! Mo Xiu!”
Zheng Yi used his strength to push Mo Xiu off the ground. Mo Xiu also used his strength and managed to jump over the Demonic Eagle’s head.
The Demonic Eagle naturally wouldn’t let Mo Xiu off. It raised its hands above its head, preparing to slap Mo Xiu to death.
However, Mo Xiu seemed to have expected this. He held the barbells in his hand and looked at the Demonic Eagle quietly.
The Demonic Eagle’s palm was about to close, and Mo Xiu’s skill was about to reach its time limit.
Suddenly, a huge palm appeared above Mo Xiu. With a full force push from the palm, Mo Xiu bounced off the Demonic Eagle’s back like a cannonball.
The one who had launched this attack was the bespectacled youth.
The Demonic Eagle’s hands landed on the space between Mo Xiu and the Demonic Eagle, missing its target.
At this moment, Mo Xiu was falling rapidly with his back facing the Demonic Eagle. He was about to reach the time limit of his skill.
Five…
Four…
Three…
“Pfft!” Mo Xiu stabbed the two barbells into Demonic Eagle’s armpits.
Mo Xiu ran and jumped over the Demonic Eagle’s head. Then, the bespectacled man used his palm to change Mo Xiu’s path. In the end, Mo Xiu stabbed the Demonic Eagle’s vital points. The entire process occurred in one smooth action.
At this moment, Mo Xiu’s movements were extremely strange. With his back facing the Demonic Eagle, he held two barbells and stabbed them into the Demonic Eagle’s body. His entire body seemed to be performing some kind of gymnastics.
The Demonic Eagle sat down on its hind claws, unable to resist anymore.
They had succeeded. He did not have absolute confidence in any of the steps just now. This was a complete gamble. Fortunately, they had won.
Mo Xiu could sense that the Demonic Eagle had lost its ability to fight, but he still held onto the metal rod and hung it on its back.
He let out a long sigh and said, “Hu! We’ve succeeded!”
…
An old man had appeared at the corner of the training grounds. If Mo Xiu saw him, he would definitely be surprised. This was because this old man was the librarian.
The old man looked at Mo Xiu as if he had seen a treasure. He muttered to himself, “What have I discovered?”


                    



Li Yuan
Shortly after the dust settled, the teachers of the school arrived at the scene.
Mo Xiu’s form teacher, Gao Quan, was also the first batch of people to arrive. When he found out what had happened, he was extremely shocked. Three students had actually managed to defeat an adult Demonic Eagle together.
At this moment, Mo Xiu and the other two were enjoying the warm applause from the other students.
Mo Xiu extended his right hand and said to the bespectacled youth, “Hello, my name is Mo Xiu. This is Zheng Yi.”
At this moment, the bespectacled youth had already recovered his thin and frail figure. After adjusting his spectacles, he held Mo Xiu’s hand and said, “I’m Liu Qingyu. I’ve already heard of how powerful you are. From the looks of it, everyone’s evaluation of you is still too low.”
Mo Xiu was stunned for a moment. He had originally thought that Liu Qingyu was an introverted person. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have such skills without any fame.
However, after hearing Liu Qingyu’s generous and appropriate words, he realized that this person was definitely not simple. He was not famous only because he kept a low profile.
Mo Xiu wanted to chat more with Liu Qingyu, but Zheng Yi interrupted them.
“What are the two of you talking about? There’s only one word to summarize this battle. Impressive! Haha, Mo Xiu is really impressive. This battle was freaking enjoyable.”
Mo Xiu sighed helplessly, knowing that any serious topic would be led astray by Zheng Yi.
Liu Qingyu said cooperatively, “It was awesome, awesome!”
Upon seeing the teachers walk over, Liu Qingyu immediately clasped his hands and bade them farewell.
“Goodbye, both of you. I’m in Year 3 Class 2. If you need any help, feel free to look for me. I don’t like being in the limelight, so I’ll take my leave first.”
Mo Xiu was puzzled. Liu Qingyu was really strange.
The group of teachers was led by Gao Quan. Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi were both Gao Quan’s students, so they were very familiar with each other. Although the teachers had many questions, they only asked a few simple questions before leaving.
Their top priority now was to appease his classmates and investigate why Demonic Eagle suddenly appeared in school.
After all, Shun City First High School was not located at the edge of the human residential area, and it was rare for wild beasts to appear here. For it to appear in the campus, things were definitely not that simple.
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi returned to their respective homes. After this battle, they were exhausted.
Actual combat and training were completely different, especially this type of extremely tense battle that expended even more stamina.
The entire process took less than three minutes, but to Mo Xiu, it was even more tiring than training for an entire afternoon.
When Mo Xiu returned home and realized that his mother was still not around, he went straight to her room to lie down.
When he looked at his skill, it had indeed become the Descent of the Martial God skill again. However, it was still on cooldown and couldn’t be used.
Unknowingly, Mo Xiu fell asleep. When he woke up again, he was woken up by his mother.
“Little Xiu, get up and eat. It’s your birthday today. I’ve stewed your favorite mountain chicken.”
Following his mother to the dining table, he looked at the four dishes and soup on the table. Mo Xiu was somewhat moved.
In this era, since one’s birthday and awakening were on the same day, the meaning of birthdays had already faded.
Ordinary families would first take a look at the skills their children had awakened. If the skills were good, they would invite their relatives and friends to celebrate.
However, if the awakened skill was not ideal, some parents might comfort their children, but most parents would be unhappy and even give their children a stern look, let alone celebrate.
The parents could not be completely blamed for this. It was caused by the environment. After all, skills were too important to a person.
However, Li Yuan was different. She would meticulously celebrate every birthday for Mo Xiu. Furthermore, she didn’t care much about his skills.
It was just like when she had seen Mo Xiu awaken in the morning. She had only asked him a simple question, but Mo Xiu had simply replied that his skill was not bad.
After that, his mother never mentioned anything about his awakening or his skills. Perhaps this was his mother’s love and trust for him.
Mo Xiu lowered his head and ate. He didn’t say anything about what had happened today, afraid that his mother would be worried.
This was also Mo Xiu’s old problem. He always reported good news without any bad news.
“Mom, I’m going to Yanjing University. When that time comes, don’t work here anymore. Come with me to Yanjing.”
Her mother picked up a piece of chicken and placed it in Mo Xiu’s bowl. She smiled and said, “I’m getting old and don’t want to be a burden anymore. Go and chase after your goal. I won’t hold you back.”
“Mom, I don’t want you to stay here alone. You’ve taken care of me for 18 years. I’ll take care of you when I get into university.”
Li Yuan knocked Mo Xiu’s head with her chopsticks. This was a common action when he was young, but it had been many years since she had beaten Mo Xiu like this.
“This world isn’t as simple as you think it is. When I was young, I asked you if you wanted to be successful or stay here with your mother for the rest of your life. At that time, your answer had already determined my answer today.”
“Mom…”
“Don’t say anything else! Just come back and visit Mom when you have the chance.”
Mo Xiu looked at his mother’s determined face and didn’t say another word. He clenched his fists tightly. He would never let his mother suffer again. Never!
After dinner, Mo Xiu went out to a desolate mountain near his home.
Mo Xiu had basically understood his own skills, so he was here to verify his ideas.
After looking around to make sure that there was no one around, he activated the Descent of the Martial God skill.
This time, Mo Xiu had been staring at his skill pattern. The moment he used Descent of the Martial God, the passive skill pattern changed for the first time and flashed.
After that, the Descent of the Martial God skill pattern spun one round, and the entire pattern flipped around. The back of the pattern was the God’s Eye skill.
So that was how it was. Mo Xiu finally understood that he indeed had three skills.
God’s Eye and Descent of the Martial God basically occupied the same skill position. The two skills were stuck together with their backs to each other. When one skill was released, it would trigger the passive skill Flip, causing the entire skill to flip to the other skill on the back.
Mo Xiu let out a long sigh. There was no problem with his skills, nor was there any uncertainty.
This way, Mo Xiu, who had two active skills, was a level higher than his peers.
The strength of his skills strengthened Mo Xiu’s determination to become stronger. At that moment, Descent of the Martial God was active. Thus, he started to fight.
After a series of punches, Mo Xiu felt extremely satisfied. On the surface, it seemed like Mo Xiu’s strength had increased by 100% after he activated his skill.
In fact, it was not just that. As Descent of the Martial God provided an improvement in all attributes, including agility, strength, reaction speed, and so on, his overall strength had definitely increased by more than 100%.
After that, Mo Xiu ran at full speed through the forest to train his coordination in this state.
Increasing his attributes was one thing, but whether it could be fully utilized was another. Only when Mo Xiu completely adapted to this amplified state could he unleash the full power of Descent of the Martial God.
This was just like the battle this afternoon, where Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi simultaneously activated their skills and charged towards the Demonic Eagle.
Zheng Yi’s skill only increased his speed by 100%, while Mo Xiu’s skill increased all of his attributes by 100%.
Logically speaking, Mo Xiu should have been faster, but Zheng Yi had reached the Demonic Eagle before Mo Xiu.
This was because this was the first time Mo Xiu had used his skill, and he wasn’t familiar enough with it. Thus, he wasn’t able to unleash its full power.
On the other hand, Zheng Yi’s understanding and proficiency in his skills far exceeded Mo Xiu’s.


                    



Cosmic Tuition Class
The next morning.
Mo Xiu sat in his seat and listened to Zheng Yi brag.
The entire class surrounded the two of them and asked them about yesterday’s incident.
“Brother Zheng, I heard that you guys defeated an adult beast yesterday?”
Zheng Yi sat at the table with his chin high. “Of course. Didn’t you see how strong your Brother Zheng and Brother Mo were? We easily beat up the Demonic Eagle and made it kneel and beg for mercy.”
Mo Xiu covered his head and didn’t want to continue listening. How was it easy? Zheng Yi had reached the time limit of his skill yesterday. If not for everyone’s support, he might still be lying in the hospital.
Zheng Yi’s speech became more and more intense. It could be said that he had been bragging from the beginning to the end. He said that he had a plan the moment the Demonic Eagle appeared, and that he knew what the Demonic Eagle’s next move would be the moment it appeared.
Initially, Mo Xiu had wanted to ignore him, but he couldn’t stop this fellow from patting Mo Xiu and saying, “Am I right, Mo Xiu?”
Mo Xiu could only brace himself and reply, “Yes, yes, yes, you’re right.”
This passionate speech ended with their form teacher Gao Quan entering the classroom.
Just like before, Gao Quan said some words of encouragement to everyone before letting them go for self-study.
Before he left, he even called Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi. Zheng Yi’s attitude after being called out was as though he was saying, “Look, everything I said is true. Even the teachers have to look for me to understand the situation.”
The two of them followed Gao Quan to his office. After Gao Quan sat down, he pointed to the seats behind them and said, “Have a seat.”
“I called you guys here today to tell you guys that we’ve been investigating for the entire night without any progress. We can’t confirm the origin of the Demonic Eagle.”
Mo Xiu nodded. He and Zheng Yi were involved in this matter, so the school had to tell them the truth.
“Also, the school unanimously decided to praise both of you in front of the whole school. They are also trying their best to help you earn extra points for your college entrance examination.”
At the mention of bonus points for the college entrance examination, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi’s eyes lit up. Zheng Yi couldn’t help but ask, “Teacher, how many points can you give us?”
Gao Quan shook his head and said, “I’m not sure yet, but since I’ve already told you about it, you don’t have to worry.”
Mo Xiu was also a little excited. He had originally thought that it was just an accident, and they would at most be praised by the entire school. He hadn’t expected that there would be such a thing as bonus points for the college entrance examination.
Gao Quan continued, “Also, if there’s any progress in the investigation of the Demonic Eagle incident, I’ll let you know.”
The two of them said simultaneously, “Thank you, Teacher.”
Gao Quan waved his hand and said, “You don’t have to thank me. The two of you fought for all of this.”
“Zheng Yi, you can go back first. Mo Xiu, stay behind.”
Both of them stood up at the same time. When they heard Gao Quan asking Mo Xiu to stay, he sat back down.
Mo Xiu didn’t understand what Gao Quan meant. Why did he want only Mo Xiu to stay behind?
After Zheng Yi left, Gao Quan’s serious expression changed. Then, he said playfully, “Mo Xiu, you’re really something. I didn’t expect to be able to come into contact with someone of Elder Tang’s level.”
Mo Xiu was confused. “Elder Tang?”
Gao Quan leaned back in his chair and said, “Alright, stop pretending. It was Elder Tang who asked me to talk to you. He even recommended that you join the Cosmic Tuition Class. Why are you pretending?”
Mo Xiu was even more puzzled. What was going on?
“Teacher Gao, did you find the wrong person? I don’t know Elder Tang at all, and I’ve never heard of any Cosmic Tuition Class. If this involves confidential information, I won’t tell anyone.”
To Mo Xiu, Gao Quan must have looked for the wrong person. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to not understand anything.
Gao Quan fell silent after hearing what Mo Xiu said, as if he was thinking about something.
“Um… Teacher, can I leave now?”
“Don’t go. I didn’t look for the wrong person. Since you don’t know the details, let me give you an introduction.”
Mo Xiu nodded.
“It doesn’t matter if you know Elder Tang or not. This chance to enter the Cosmic Tuition Class is very rare. I know you must not have heard of the Cosmic Tuition Class, but you must have heard of the Shadows.”
Mo Xiu’s eyes lit up. The Shadows were familiar to everyone. They were part of an organization that belonged to the Alliance but was not restricted by the Alliance. They were something many people yearned for.
The Shadows were like secret enforcers. Usually, they were free to choose whether they would accept missions or not. The Shadows would only be gathered when the Alliance needed them to carry out some important missions. Even so, the Shadows could refuse the missions.
This was equivalent to having status and money, but they also had the freedom of time. As long as one did not want to, it was possible not to accept even a single mission.
“I know about the Shadows. What does this Tuition Class have to do with the Shadows?”
“If you graduate from the Cosmic Tuition Class, there is a high chance that you will directly become a Shadow.”
Mo Xiu was shocked. After all, the selection for Shadows was very strict. Only those who entered university could register for the Shadow selection. Furthermore, the minimum requirement to register was to have two skills.
The Cosmic Tuition Class sounded more like a special training camp before the college entrance examination.
“Teacher, I only have one skill. Can I really become Shadow in advance?”
Gao Quan looked deeply at Mo Xiu and said, “Sure, as long as you can graduate from the Tuition Class successfully.”
“Understood.”
“Are you going to participate?”
“Yes!”
Although it was rather baffling, Mo Xiu didn’t want to let go of this opportunity.
“Alright. Give a call to your family and let them know that you are attending the Tuition Class for ten days, starting from tonight. In other words, you will be away until the day before the college entrance examination.”
“Ah? Is it so sudden?”
Even Mo Xiu couldn’t remain calm. Wasn’t this too hasty? Was he going to leave today and only return the day before the college entrance examination?
“Is there a problem?”
“No! No, but… I have a question.”
“What question?”
“Who is Elder Tang? I don’t know him. Why did he recommend that I attend the Cosmic Tuition Class?”
After a moment of silence, Gao Quan said, “Since he doesn’t want you to know, don’t ask. You’ll meet him sooner or later.”
“I got it. I’ll get going now.”
“Okay, sure. By the way, you can’t tell anyone about this, including your family. Tell everyone that you were sent to another city as an exchange student.”
Mo Xiu increasingly felt that this Cosmic Tuition Tlass was not simple. However, as his form teacher, Gao Quan had no need to lie to him.
“Understood…”
After returning to the classroom, it was lunchtime. Zheng Yi asked Mo Xiu and Gao Quan what Gao Quan had told them.
Mo Xiu also told Zheng Yi what Gao Quan said about being an exchange student.
“Impressive, bro. This is the first time I’ve heard of an exchange student. Which city and school are you going to?”
Mo Xiu gave Zheng Yi a knowing look and replied, “Don’t you know which school I’m going to?”
Zheng Yi hesitated for a moment before saying, “Oh… Yes, I know.”
Mo Xiu had already taken a few steps away, but Zheng Yi was still muttering to himself.
“Which school is it?”
Mo Xiu had said this on purpose. With Zheng Yi’s personality, he would definitely pretend to know and only ask Mo Xiu if he couldn’t think of the answer in the future.
What would Mo Xiu do when Zheng Yi reacted? At that time, Mo Xiu would have gone to the Cosmic Tuition Class.
As the training grounds were undergoing maintenance, there was no way to train in the afternoon, so Mo Xiu could go home and pack his luggage.
After splitting up with Zheng Yi, Mo Xiu had just walked out of the school gates when he was stopped by a girl.
“Hello, Senior Mo. May I disturb you?”
“Who are you?”
“Ah! My name is Ye Qian’er. You saved me yesterday. Thanks to you, I only suffered some light injuries.”
Mo Xiu slapped his head. It turned out that she was the girl who was captured by the Demonic Eagle yesterday. It was no wonder that she looked familiar.
“Why are you looking for me?”
Ye Qian’er placed her hands behind her back and lowered her head, not daring to look at Mo Xiu.
Seeing that Ye Qian’er did not respond, Mo Xiu asked again.
“May I know why you’re looking for me?”
When Ye Qian’er heard Mo Xiu’s words, she seemed to have been jolted awake. Her whole body trembled and she stretched out the hand behind her back.
She was holding a paper bag in her hand, and she hurriedly threw it to Mo Xiu.
“Thank you, senior. This is for you.”
Then, she turned around and ran off…


                    



So You Are Elder Tang
Mo Xiu caught the bag that Ye Qian’er had thrown over and smiled awkwardly. What was going on? Was he scary?
Mo Xiu shook his head as he watched Ye Qian’er run away.
On the other side, Ye Qian’er ran behind a tree and hid. Breathing heavily, she used the tree to block her body and looked back.
Then, she covered her face with her hands and squatted down, as if she was too ashamed to face anyone.
“Aiya, how embarrassing. Why am I being so shy when I’m just thanking him?”
…
When Mo Xiu returned home, he cleaned up briefly and packed a few clothes to change into.
He left a note for his mother, informing her that he would not return home for the time being.
Telephone communication was already very convenient, but Mo Xiu still liked to leave a note when communicating with his mother. Perhaps it was because writing it on paper was more realistic.
In the evening, Mo Xiu looked for Gao Quan.
Then, Gao Quan drove Mo Xiu out of the city.
Mo Xiu finally couldn’t help but ask, “Teacher, where are we going? Why are we so far away? We’re almost in no man’s land.”
“Why? Are you afraid that I’ll sell you away?”
“No, no!”
Of course, Mo Xiu wouldn’t suspect anything. Not only did Gao Quan have a high status in the school, even if he wanted to sell his students, he would sell Zheng Yi, that young master. There was no need to sell a poor student like Mo Xiu.
The car traveled until it was completely dark. Mo Xiu was a little hungry. He rummaged through his backpack, but only the paper bag Ye Qian’er gave him seemed to contain food.
He opened it and saw that it was indeed food. It was cookies and looked like it was made by Ye Qian’er. He took out a piece and ate it. It tasted really good.
Gao Quan saw Mo Xiu eating cookies. No matter how he looked at it, the bag looked like it was given by a girl.
“Oh, is that a gift from your girlfriend? I love to eat food that others have made for me.”
As he spoke, he grabbed a cookie and ate it.
“This tastes pretty good. Which lady is this from?”
In Mo Xiu’s memories, Gao Quan had always been a responsible form teacher. Thus, he didn’t expect him to be so casual in private.
“You’re mistaken. The girl who I saved yesterday gave these cookies to me to thank me.”
“Was she Ye Qian’er? She’s a famous beauty. You’re really lucky.”
“Er…”
Mo Xiu almost choked on his words. This was not just casual, but also… disrespectful.
As Gao Quan teased him, the car finally stopped in front of a large courtyard.
Mo Xiu looked at the time. It was already 9 pm, but this didn’t look like a tuition class.
Mo Xiu followed Gao Quan into the courtyard. Two middle-aged men walked towards them.
One of them said, “Is this the person recommended by Elder Tang?”
Gao Quan replied unhappily, “Of course, I’ve already brought him here. How can he be a fake?”
The two middle-aged men chatted with Gao Quan and arranged a room for Mo Xiu.
Even after entering the room and lying on the bed, Mo Xiu was still in disbelief.
Was this simple courtyard the Cosmic Tuition Class that Gao Quan had mentioned? Was this the Tuition Class that would allow one to become a Shadow after graduating?
After a night of silence, Mo Xiu woke up early the next morning to wash up. The water source was the underground water from the well.
He looked more closely at the courtyard and found that there was something odd about it. There was a small circle of rooms with a large and empty field in the middle. The field in the middle was quite large, perhaps even larger than the school field.
Before Mo Xiu could finish washing up, a voice resounded throughout the courtyard.
“Gather in five minutes!”
Mo Xiu looked up and saw two middle-aged men in the middle of the courtyard. Then, he ran over without a word.
He ran to the two of them and stood in front of them. It was too dark last night, so he couldn’t see their faces clearly.
Upon closer inspection, he realized that these two were clearly twins. They looked too similar. The only difference was that one wore glasses while the other did not.
Then, two men ran out from the surrounding houses. One was fat and the other was thin. They looked quite comical when they ran together.
The next person who came out shocked Mo Xiu. She was a woman, a woman Mo Xiu was very familiar with.
She was Mu Qingyi! Why was she here?
After standing in line, the two of them looked at each other and smiled. What a coincidence.
The bespectacled middle-aged man said, “Alright, everyone is here. No one is late. Mo Xiu, step forward!”
Mo Xiu took a step forward upon hearing this.
“You were the first to arrive. From now on, you will be the leader of this team. If the team members make a mistake, you will be punished too.”
When Mo Xiu heard the first half of the sentence, he thought that it was an important task, but when he heard the second half, his expression immediately changed.
Why did it sound like he had to be punished for being the first to report?
“Mo Xiu, did you hear me?”
Mo Xiu quickly replied, “Yes, I got it.”
“Alright, fall back in.”
“Let me introduce myself. My name is Wang Yu. This is my brother, Wang Lei. If you can’t differentiate between the two of us, remember that the one wearing glasses is the younger brother, Wang Yu.”
The four of them were still waiting for Wang Yu’s next order. They did not expect Wang Yu to say something unexpected.
“Okay, you are dismissed. Finish your breakfast before 8 am and come to this classroom. The canteen is the room at the main entrance.”
After saying that, the two brothers returned to their room and left the four of them in the same spot.
What kind of situation was this? One second, it was serious, as if they were going through military training, and the next, they were dismissed as if they were playing around. They didn’t even have a morning exercise!
Seeing that everyone was embarrassed, Mo Xiu took the lead and said, “Everyone, let’s introduce ourselves and get to know one another.”
“I’ll go first. My name is Mo Xiu. I’m a student from Shun City First High School.”
After that, the others started to introduce themselves. The skinny guy, Yue Yuan, and the fatty, Liu Ziyang, were both from Shun City Glory High School.
Mo Xiu had long heard of Glory High School. It was the best elite school in the city. Anyone who could enter that school was not simple.
After a deeper understanding of the situation, Mo Xiu finally understood the nature of this Cosmic Tuition Class. It wasn’t a tuition class at all. It was more like a training camp.
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan’s families had arranged for them to come here to receive training and obtain the qualifications to become Shadows.
After breakfast, they split up. At this moment, Mu Qingyi secretly went to find Mo Xiu.
“Mo Xiu? Why are you here?”
Mo Xiu said, “I wanted to ask you, why are you here?”
Mu Qingyi was a little happy to see Mo Xiu. The previous gathering was organized by Mu Qingyi to bid farewell to her high school friends before going to the Cosmic Tuition Class.
At that time, Mo Xiu did not go to the gathering, and Mu Qingyi was still a bit regretful. However, she did not expect to meet him again here.
Mu Qingyi skipped over to Mo Xiu and said, “I didn’t expect to see you here. Who recommended that you come here?”
Mo Xiu said awkwardly, “I don’t know either. I heard that it was Elder Tang?”
Mu Qingyi widened her eyes and said, “Are you Elder Tang’s disciple? You’re too amazing.”
“No. Actually, I don’t know Old Tang.”
“You don’t know Elder Tang? That’s impossible. With Elder Tang’s status, he wouldn’t recommend you if he didn’t know you. Oh right, he’s usually in our school’s library.”
Mo Xiu came to a sudden realization. It turned out that Elder Tang was the old man in the library who gave him goosebumps. Thinking about the way that old man looked at him, he felt a little nervous.
“So it’s him. We’ve met before. Is he amazing?”
“Of course, he has contributed greatly to the Alliance. During the war…”
Mu Qingyi’s words came to an abrupt halt. She covered her mouth with both hands and stared at Mo Xiu with wide eyes.
“I said something I couldn’t say.”
“It’s okay. I won’t tell anyone.”
“Swear it!”
“I promise I won’t tell anyone.”
“Swear it!”
“I swear that I won’t tell anyone that you, Mu Qingyi, told me about it.”
“You…”


                    



Physique Limit Theory
When Mo Xiu found out that Elder Tang was the old man from the library, he felt like he had been tricked.
After chatting for a while, the four students went to the so-called classroom and sat down. This was an extremely ordinary room.
At the front of the room was a bed and a blackboard. Meanwhile, there were scattered chairs at the back of the classroom.
The few of them quickly tidied up after entering the classroom and arranged the chairs so that the entire classroom did not look as messy.
Just as Mo Xiu was wondering how the teacher would teach with a bed in front of the classroom…
Wang Yu strode into the classroom and sat on the bed. Then, he adjusted his glasses and said, “Not bad, everyone is here.”
Mo Xiu was so shocked that he couldn’t speak. From the name of the Cosmic Training Class, to the classroom and the teacher, everything seemed very casual.
Mo Xiu felt that it was better to stay in school and study. Then, he looked at the other three people and saw that they were all looking at Wang Yu with respect.
Wang Yu coughed and said, “Ahem, let me introduce you to the curriculum of the Cosmic Tuition Class. There are ten days of classes in total. They are divided into the theory classes that I will teach in the morning, and the combat classes that my brother, Wang Lei, will teach in the afternoon.”
“First of all, what is taught in the Tuition Class might not be very useful for your college entrance examination.”
“The main thing is to improve your combat ability. The theory class has nothing to do with the high school curriculum either.”
“Do you have any questions? If not, I’ll start teaching.”
Seeing that no one asked any questions, Wang Yu continued, “Okay, today we will talk about basic knowledge regarding skills.”
Mo Xiu didn’t understand. He had just said that he wasn’t going to talk about high school knowledge. Why was he talking about the basic knowledge regarding skills?
“All of you know the randomness of skill awakening. In that case, do you know what is stable about skill awakening?”
Mo Xiu shook his head, indicating that he wasn’t sure. Meanwhile, the fatty Liu Ziyang, said proudly, “I know. Skills can be inherited.”
Wang Yu added, “That’s right. Skills do not appear randomly. They are inherited. In other words, your parents’ skills are likely to be inherited by you.”
“This is not the only thing that is stable about skills. Skills will also be limited to a general direction based on each person’s physique. I call this the Physique Limit Theory.”
“Physiques are divided into many types. The broadest categories are the warrior physique, the assassin physique, the mage physique, and the assistant investigative physique. Of course, there are also some special categories, but they are relatively rare.”
“For those who have a warrior physique, their awakened skills will mostly consist of basic offensive and defensive skills.”
“For those with an assassin physique, they will mostly awaken agility-type, concealment-type, or high explosion-type skills.”
“As for those with a mage physique, their skills are more inclined towards elemental damage.”
“And so on and so forth. Everyone has their own physique, and the choice of their skills is limited to this range.”
Mo Xiu’s expression was serious. This was not basic knowledge regarding skills. If this theory that he had never heard of before was true, it would cause a sensation among the people. However, why had he never heard of it?
Thus, Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, I have a question. Why haven’t I heard of this theory before?”
Wang Yu adjusted his glasses and said, “It’s strange if you’ve heard it before, because I developed this theory myself.”
Mo Xiu wasn’t the only one who was stunned. When the others heard Wang Yu’s words, they were all dumbfounded. Wasn’t this too much of a joke? He just talked about the theory that he had come up himself just like that!
The skinny Yue Yuan asked, “Teacher, what is the accuracy of your theory?”
Wang Yu did not answer Yue Yuan’s question. Instead, he said directly, “Mo Xiu has a warrior physique, Liu Ziyang has an assassin physique, and Yue Yuan has a mage physique. I can’t determine Mu Qingyi’s physique. Think about what I’ve said, okay?”
Everyone fell silent. Mo Xiu focused his attention on his skill. The active skill was Descent of the Martial God. According to Wang Yu’s theory, it was indeed suitable for someone with a warrior physique.
Seeing that no one said anything, Wang Yu continued, “Let me introduce myself again. I am an intelligence agent from the Shadow Headquarters. My first skill is X-Ray Vision. Don’t misunderstand. This skill allows me to see your basic attributes. My second skill is Integration. I can use this skill to integrate big data into categories. My third skill is Rapid Number Analysis, while my fourth skill is Confidentiality.”
“I have a data-based physique, which means I’m an out-and-out knowledge worker. Many people know about my skills, so there’s no need to keep them a secret. All my theories have some basis.”
Mo Xiu was shocked. These skills weren’t strong, but when combined together with Shadow’s powerful intelligence system, they were simply too powerful.
To exaggerate, the person who was lecturing him was Shadow’s central computer.
Mo Xiu never thought that such a big shot would actually come to lecture him. He had even questioned Wang Yu just now.
After that, Wang Yu talked about a lot of skill knowledge that Mo Xiu had never heard of before. The four of them also picked up a piece of paper and a pen to record the information.
Mo Xiu once again looked forward to the Cosmic Tuition Class. What Wang Yu said might not have any effect on the college entrance examination, but it was very important for his future development.
If he used this knowledge well, it could change the outcome of a battle, or even the direction of a battle.
The lecture lasted the entire morning. Mo Xiu did not relax as he listened to Wang Yu and took notes.
After the entire lesson, he felt extremely content. This was not just a lesson, neither did it simply deepen his understanding of skills. It was an improvement of his entire understanding of the world.
Furthermore, this lesson, which was extremely important to Mo Xiu, was taught by the teacher sitting on the bed in such an ordinary courtyard and a simple classroom.
Perhaps it was because they had been taught differently since they were young, but Mu Qingyi and the other two did not have such deep feelings. They might have been influenced by their family since they were young. Thus, they more or less had some knowledge about skills.
However, from a young age, all of Mo Xiu’s knowledge came from school textbooks, causing Mo Xiu to reflect on Wang Yu’s teachings all afternoon.
There was a combat class in the afternoon. The four of them stood neatly in the middle of the courtyard.
Wang Lei slowly walked towards them and said, “We will start the combat class now. You must understand the importance of the combat class. In ten days’ time, there will be no test for the theory class, only actual combat. So all of you better keep your spirits up.”
“Yes!”
The four of them shouted together.
“Alright, let’s start the lesson now. Today’s lesson content is to fight me. All of you, come at me together.”
Mo Xiu and the others looked at each other. What was going on? Why was he so direct?
Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, aren’t we going to jog to warm up?”
Wang Lei said unhappily, “When you meet an enemy, will they give you time to warm up? Also, I’m not here to train your basic skills. Hurry up and start!”
The four of them had no choice but to brace themselves. Mo Xiu was somewhat vexed. He didn’t even know what his teammates’ skills were like. How could he fight?
As the team leader, Mo Xiu could only take the initiative to attack. His entire body flashed with golden light as he activated Descent of the Martial God and punched Wang Lei’s face.
However, Wang Lei didn’t even move. Instead, his entire body was instantly covered in flames. Even his face was covered in flames.
Mo Xiu’s punch landed solidly on Wang Lei’s face, but Wang Lei did not move at all. On the contrary, Mo Xiu had to take two steps back before he could stabilize himself.
Looking at the burn marks on his hands, he looked at Wang Lei in shock. Even when he used his skill, he could not break through Wang Lei’s defense.
How could they fight this battle???


                    



Combat Class
Mo Xiu wasn’t sure if Wang Yu would discover God’s Eye, so he didn’t dare to use it rashly.
It was just like how his entire body would flash with a golden light when he activated Descent of the Martial God. If he could not see the effect of Wang Yu’s skills when he activated God’s Eyes, that meant that he had been exposed.
Mu Qingyi and the other two saw that Mo Xiu had no intention of continuing to fight after being defeated. Thus, they were all stunned on the spot, not knowing what to do.
Currently, Wang Lei’s entire body was engulfed in flames, making it impossible to see his expression clearly. However, his next action let everyone know that he was angry.
With two large strides, Wang Lei passed by Mo Xiu and arrived before the other three people.
He punched the fatty Liu Ziyang. However, the moment his fist came into contact with Liu Ziyang’s body, Liu Ziyang’s entire body turned illusory.
Wang Lei’s punch actually missed. An afterimage of Liu Ziyang was left behind in his original spot, and he completely disappeared.
Wang Lei immediately turned around and punched again!
The next scene was rather strange. A black shadow appeared behind Wang Lei. Then, the black shadow gradually solidified. When the entire black shadow appeared, Wang Lei’s punch landed on the figure.
That was right! This figure was Liu Ziyang. The skill that Liu Ziyang used just now was similar to the Flash. He left behind an afterimage in the distance and instantly appeared behind Wang Lei.
However, he did not expect Wang Lei to see through him. The strength of this punch was not light, and it directly sent Liu Ziyang flying.
Wang Lei did not stop. He delivered a kick towards Yue Yuan, who immediately retreated upon seeing this scene.
Wang Lei chased after him, but when Wang Lei took a step forward, a circle appeared beneath his feet and a burst of light erupted.
After that, Wang Lei stopped moving. Yue Yuan shouted, “Quick, attack now!”
When Mo Xiu, Liu Ziyang, and Mu Qingyi heard this, they attacked together. Mo Xiu was the closest to Wang Lei, and he directly punched Wang Lei’s back with all his strength.
Meanwhile, the fatty Li Ziyang was not slow either. He took out a dagger from somewhere and stabbed it at Wang Lei’s right arm.
Mu Qingyi stood where she was and threw out a flying dagger that headed straight for Wang Lei’s face.
Wang Lei was attacked from three sides. The three of them reacted extremely quickly and attacked in less than a second.
Wang Lei only paused for a second. After regaining his mobility, he grabbed Liu Ziyang’s wrist and threw him behind him, hitting Mo Xiu.
Then, his left hand went to grab Mu Qingyi’s flying dagger. However, the dagger unexpectedly passed through Wang Lei’s palm and headed straight for his face.
Pa!
The dagger hit Wang Lei but did not cause any damage. Like Mo Xiu’s attack at the start, it did not break Wang Lei’s defense.
After that, the four of them no longer had any strength to resist and were beaten up by Wang Lei. Other than Mu Qingyi who was slightly better off, the other three could be said to be covered in injuries.
Wang Lei retracted his skill and said, “You guys will have your second challenge in three hours.”
Even Mo Xiu was starting to feel despair. How was he supposed to fight this person? He couldn’t even break through his defense, but he had to challenge him a second time in three hours.
Mo Xiu could only gather them together to discuss their battle plan for the next challenge.
“In the battle just now, we didn’t know each other’s skills, so we were a little flustered. In order to better cooperate, we should first learn about each other’s skills.”
“I’ll go first. My skill is called Descent of the Martial God. It can increase all of my attributes.”
Even if Mo Xiu did not mention how much his attributes would increase after activating this skill, Mu Qingyi and the other two were still slightly surprised. They had never heard of a skill that could increase all attributes.
Mu Qingyi was the second to speak. “My technique is Spatial Folding, which can allow me to transport objects. The flying knife just now could pass through Teacher Wang Lei’s palm because I actually used Spatial Folding. Unfortunately, my attack power is too weak, and I couldn’t cause any harm to Teacher Wang Lei.”
Liu Ziyang continued, “My skill is called Afterimage. All of you have seen the effect. It leaves behind an afterimage and allows me to disappear. One second later, I will appear at any spot within a one-meter radius from my original position.”
Yue Yuan said, “My skill is Five Elements Formation. Metal is used to strengthen my attacks, wood is used to stun, water is used to heal, fire is used to damage, and earth is used to strengthen my defense. I can set up a formation on any spot on the ground, but I cannot activate it. Instead, it will activate automatically after two seconds. I used the Wood Formation to temporarily control Teacher Wang Lei just now.”
No one hid the effects of their skill. There was no need to hide it either. After all, their skill would definitely be known in the future battles.
What really needed to be hidden was the duration of the skill, its cooldown time, and other important information. This was because it was easy for others to exploit this information.
Logically speaking, the skills of these few people were variable and they could formulate many strategies with them. However, under Wang Lei’s absolute defense, no one had any good ideas.
During the second challenge, no one had any fighting spirit. When they were faced with an undefeatable opponent, it was a hopeless situation.
As a result, the challenge ended very quickly. The four of them were mostly harassing him. Mo Xiu didn’t even use any skills.
In the end, the four of them were beaten up again and laid on the ground.
Wang Lei’s mood was dampened as he said, “Today’s combat class is over. Tomorrow, you will continue challenging me.”
The four of them helped each other to sit up. Mo Xiu and the others suspected that this combat class was not meant to train them. Instead, Wang Lei simply wanted to torture noobs like them.
At night…
After the four of them had their meal, Yue Yuan used the water formation in the Five Elements Formation to heal everyone.
After that, they went back to their own rooms to rest. After all, they had been beaten up for an entire afternoon and were all very tired.
After returning to his room, Mo Xiu began to summarize what he had learned today. At this moment, his phone rang.
It was a message from Zheng Yi.
“Mo Xiu, you’re such a jerk. You told me that you were going to become an exchange student, but you didn’t say that you would leave so soon. Which school did you go to?”
Mo Xiu replied.
“There are only ten days left until the college entrance examination. Of course I’ll leave immediately as an exchange student.”
“Oh, okay. Which school is it?”
“It’s a school you’d never think of.”
…
On the other side of the courtyard, a heated discussion was taking place in a room.
Wang Lei said to an old man, “Elder Tang, Mo Xiu’s skills are indeed rare. His skill might be able to improve all his attributes, but it’s not enough for you to make an exception and send him to the Cosmic Tuition Class.”
At this moment, Elder Tang was lying on his side on the bed and said angrily, “What do you know? Let me tell you, this kid is not simple. Maybe he has more than one skill. Wang Yu, look at that kid’s attributes today and see if there are any abnormalities.”
Wang Yu thought for a moment. Then, he pushed his glasses up and said, “The basic attributes of his body are not bad. His skills belong to the warrior category. There are no abnormalities.”
“From tomorrow onwards, I’ll give you a mission. Activate your skills to observe Mo Xiu throughout the day.”
…
The next morning, in the classroom.
“The main topic today is about upgrading skills.”
“Before that, let’s talk about what happened yesterday. Did you notice that Wang Lei asked you to rest for three hours before fighting again?”
The four of them nodded.
“In that case, how did Wang Lei determine that your skills could complete their cooldown in three hours?”
That was right. How did Wang Lei know that the cooldown time for all four skills was within three hours?
“The reason is very simple. According to big data analysis, unless the skill is some large-scale killing skill, the cooldown time will be within three hours. This is something that will be covered in university courses. You guys should understand it first.”
“Let’s get back to the main topic. There are two ways to upgrade your skills. One is to train, and the other is to eat.”


                    



We Still Want to Fight
“There are two ways to upgrade your skills. One is to train, and the other is to eat.”
“Training refers to training your own skills. Meanwhile, eating refers to eating heavenly treasures. I shouldn’t need to explain too much as you should all know this.”
“Let’s talk about the importance of upgrading your skills and my personal understanding of the situation.”
Mo Xiu understood that Wang Yu’s personal understanding could basically be trusted. However, it was not publicly recognized and printed into textbooks.
“You fellows should have noticed by now. Yesterday, Wang Lei had only used one skill. However, when he fought against you all, it was basically a crushing defeat. That is because his skill level is far above yours.”
Mo Xiu raised his hand and asked, “Teacher, I would like to ask if the skill levels only differ by one level, will there be a huge difference in actual combat?”
Wang Yu gestured for Mo Xiu to put his hand down.
“There is a very large difference. If we ignore the increase in the strength of the skill, the difference of one level is very likely to reduce the cooldown time by half. Can you understand this concept?”
Mo Xiu understood. In a life and death battle, the cooldown time was related to life and death. It was just like when he fought the Demonic Eagle previously. If his skill had entered its cooldown time, the consequences would have been unimaginable.
“In that case, what level is Teacher Wang Lei’s skill at? Even if there’s a difference, it can’t be that big, right?”
After Liu Ziyang asked this question, he realized that he had been a little rude.
Wang Yu didn’t mind and replied, “His skill is at Level-4.”
“Let’s move on. First, let’s talk about training. This is very metaphysical. Some people use their skills every day for eight or ten years, but they might not even be able to level up by one level. Some people might level up their skills after using them a few times. I’ve concluded that training alone is useless. It’s more important to understand your own skills.”
“Then, let’s talk about eating. After ‘The Beginning’ came into being, humans gained four skills, animals gained talent skills, and plants became heavenly treasures. As a result, almost all plants now have an effect, not to mention the herbs that have become priceless treasures.”
“There are many types of herbs. Some of them can directly evolve skills. For example, the Spirit Ring that you are most familiar with can directly upgrade skills from Level-1 to Level-2.”
Mo Xiu was no stranger to these things. There was a herb store in Shun City. He had once entered it and was shocked by the astronomical prices inside.
His mother’s monthly salary was 5,000 yuan, while an ordinary body-strengthening herb cost 50,000 yuan. This was almost his mother’s annual salary.
Hence, Mo Xiu had never thought about herbs. He could only work harder than others in exchange for better physical fitness.
During this lesson, Wang Yu explained a lot about his understanding of skill levels. This was the second time Mo Xiu had attended Wang Yu’s lesson, and he was still shocked and benefited greatly from it.
At noon, the four of them quickly went to the field to discuss their strategy after lunch. This was because they would be beaten up again in the afternoon.
Time flew by and it was already afternoon. Just like yesterday, Wang Lei walked leisurely to the front of the crowd.
“Be…”
Pa!
Before Wang Lei could finish speaking, Mo Xiu had already attacked. His right arm swept out and struck Wang Lei’s right arm.
This time, Mo Xiu did not use any skills. This was because after the first battle yesterday, his skill had been switched to God’s Eye. In the second battle, he did not use any skills.
Thus, if Mo Xiu wanted to use Descent of the Martial God, he could only use God’s Eye once to reverse his skills.
He couldn’t care too much about it now. He hadn’t been discovered even after using God’s Eye twice, so there shouldn’t be any problems.
The moment he hit Wang Lei, Mo Xiu activated his skill, God’s Eye.
“First Skill: Inferno Armor (Can be activated).”
“Skill Effect: Covers the user in flames. Increases defense by 300% and attack by 500% (Additional burn effect).”
“Duration: 30 minutes.”
“Cooldown: One hour.”
He could only see one skill. However, it was impossible for Wang Lei to only have one skill. This meant that there was still room for Mo Xiu to upgrade God’s Eye. Currently, he could only see one skill.
His passive skill, Flip, flashed and his active skill became Descent of the Martial God. Then, Mo Xiu immediately used his skill.
Another punch was thrown out. At this moment, Wang Lei reacted and immediately activated Inferno Armor.
Mo Xiu’s punch landed on the flames, causing Wang Lei’s feet to retreat slightly.
This time, the way Wang Lei looked at Mo Xiu changed. Mo Xiu threw another punch at Wang Lei. Wang Lei did not take it head on but dodged to the side.
Mo Xiu didn’t have any secret moves. It was just that he didn’t use his full strength when he saw Wang Lei covered in flames yesterday to prevent himself from getting injured.
However, today, the first thing he did was to fight with all his might regardless of whether he was injured or not.
While Mo Xiu and Wang Lei were exchanging blows, the other three were not idle either. Mu Qingyi found a good angle to throw flying daggers. Although they could not break through Wang Lei’s defense, they could at least cause some interference.
Sure enough, as Mo Xiu expected, Mu Qingyi’s daggers only made Wang Lei dodge slightly. They did not have any substantial effect.
At the same time, Liu Ziyang went behind Wang Lei and prepared to launch a sneak attack. Wang Lei swung his hand back and hit an afterimage. Liu Ziyang had activated his skill.
Wang Lei thought that Liu Ziyang would appear beside him and attack him from both sides with Mo Xiu. Thus, he held back when attacking Mo Xiu.
However, when Liu Ziyang appeared again, he was still behind Wang Lei. He only retreated by a meter.
Only then did Wang Lei realize that he had been tricked. He immediately attacked Mo Xiu.
However, it was too late. A golden light flashed beneath Mo Xiu’s feet. Yue Yuan’s metal array had already been activated, increasing Mo Xiu’s attack power.
Mo Xiu felt that his strength had increased by about 20%. This was an increase of 20% after using Descent of the Martial God. Thus, the increase was quite impressive.
However, fighting against Wang Lei was still very strenuous. In terms of actual combat experience, there was still a huge gap between them, let alone the difference in strength.
Mo Xiu took a step back as Wang Lei took a step forward and stood at Mo Xiu’s original position.
Then, something unexpected happened. Two beams of light shot out from beneath Wang Lei’s feet. It was Yue Yuan’s fire array and wood array. The fire array attacked Wang Lei first.
This time, the attack only caused Wang Lei to pause for a moment, and did not cause any damage. However, the wood array that was triggered immediately caused Wang Lei to freeze in place.
Mo Xiu’s legs bent, and he twisted his waist into a terrifying angle to accumulate power. Then, he punched out.
The Bow Fist was the most powerful attack that Mo Xiu knew. Whether or not they would succeed in this challenge depended on this move.
“Bang!!!”
This punch landed on Wang Lei’s lower abdomen, causing him to take a step back, but it was only a single step.
Then, Wang Lei stabilized his body. Even if the four of them rushed forward, they would not have the chance to fight back.
The opportunity had already appeared, but they were still unable to defeat Wang Lei. The disparity between them was simply too great.
After knocking all four of them to the ground, Wang Lei clapped his hands and said, “Not bad, not bad. You actually came up with such a feasible plan. You are still using Mo Xiu as the main attacker. However, their teamwork is clearly better than yesterday.”
“Mu Qingyi and Liu Ziyang’s attacks were all fake. The goal was to let Yue Yuan enhance Mo Xiu’s strength and set up a trap for me. There was a very clever point. Yue Yuan placed three array formations under Mo Xiu’s feet consecutively. After he finished enhancing Mo Xiu’s strength, he triggered the other two array formations one second after the other, allowing me to step on them without any doubt.”
“Not a bad strategy. Who designed the strategy?”
The other three looked at Mo Xiu.
Wang Lei said, “You’re a pretty good leader.”
Mo Xiu said directly, “Teacher, we still want to fight!”


                    



The First Lesson
“We still want to fight!”
Not only did Mo Xiu say this, but Mu Qingyi, Yue Yuan, and Liu Ziyang also looked at Wang Lei with battle intent in their eyes.
Wang Lei smiled and said, “Not bad. The first lesson is over.”
Mo Xiu and the others were puzzled. The first lesson was over?
Wang Lei’s voice sounded again.
“The first lesson is to become unyielding. Yesterday, you gave up on the second challenge, but today, you took the initiative to challenge me. You are clearly facing an invincible enemy, but you made different choices.”
“When facing enemies who are many times stronger than you, choosing to not give up is the first lesson. During the great war, when humans faced the powerful Beast Emperors whose skills have no cooldown, they were even more desperate than you. However, that generation did not give up. In order to protect their home and family, they chose to fight.”
“That battle caused rivers of blood to flow and corpses to cover the ground. That battle was the greatest calamity in human history. However, it was also the most glorious battle for mankind. That battle protected the homeland of mankind. There was hope left in that battle.”
“Although I’m not your enemy, I want to teach you that when you have nowhere to retreat on the battlefield, you should bring out your fighting spirit. So what if the enemy is strong? When people stimulate their potential, it’s enough to create miracles, right?”
Wang Lei’s words made Mo Xiu and the other three feel emotional. Although they hadn’t personally witnessed that war, the only reason they could live peacefully now was because of that war.
Thus, Mo Xiu was no stranger to that war. Wang Lei was right. When facing an enemy, one had to maintain their fighting spirit.
“Alright, we’ll rest for the rest of the day. The individual battles will begin tomorrow.”
Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, what does the individual battle mean?”
“That means that the four of you will fight each other in a one-on-one battle.”
Mo Xiu and the others were stunned. Was there such a thing?
After the combat class ended, Yue Yuan healed everyone and left. Tomorrow was the individual battle, so everyone had to be prepared.
Mo Xiu was no exception. After returning to his room, he organized his notes and analyzed how he should fight the others.
After dinner, Mo Xiu walked out of the courtyard alone and started punching a large rock.
Having been here for two days without any basic training or boxing, Mo Xiu felt that it was best not to fall behind.
However, before he could finish his set of punches, he heard bell-like laughter behind him.
“Hehehe, Mo Xiu, aren’t you working too hard?”
Mo Xiu turned around. Who else could it be but Mu Qingyi?
“Same to you. I’m just a poor kid who’s trying very hard to make a name for myself. It’s rare and precious for a young lady like you to work so hard.”
Upon hearing Mo Xiu’s words, Mu Qingyi suddenly lowered her head in sadness.
Mo Xiu did not know Mu Qingyi very well, and had never seen her like this.
When they were in school, both of them would train until the school closed. They would leave together many times, but they were not that close.
The two of them simply walked together and greeted each other briefly. When they walked out of the school gate, Mu Qingyi would be picked up by the car that had been waiting at the gate for a long time.
However, even so, Mu Qingyi was the girl Mo Xiu had the closest relationship with in high school.
Mu Qingyi did not speak, and Mo Xiu did not know what to do. He did not know if he should say anything or leave her like this.
Mu Qingyi jumped onto the big rock and sat on it without caring if the rock was dirty or not.
The rock was rather tall. As a result, when Mu Qingyi sat on the edge of the rock, her feet did not touch the ground. Her feet swung in the air just like that.
Then, she turned around and smiled brightly. “Shall we sit for a while?”
Mo Xiu was not infatuated, but he was still mesmerized by the elegant Mu Qingyi before him.
“What’s wrong? Is a man like you afraid of a little girl like me?”
Mo Xiu regained his senses and walked straight to Mu Qingyi’s side to sit down.
“Of course I’m afraid of you. Which man isn’t afraid of a woman, let alone a beautiful woman like you?”
Mu Qingyi giggled.
“Hahaha, I didn’t expect a blockhead like you to be so eloquent.”
Mo Xiu smiled and looked ahead without saying anything. He was sitting under the moonlight, with a light breeze blowing through the air and a beauty beside him. Who wouldn’t yearn for such a comfortable life?
Just like that, the two of them sat there quietly, neither speaking nor appearing awkward. It was as if the two of them were supposed to be watching the night scenery.
“It’s very comfortable being with you.”
The two of them spoke at the same time and smiled at each other.
Mu Qingyi brushed her hair that was blown down by the breeze and said, “I’m not trying hard because I want to, but it’s because I don’t want to go home.”
“Oh.”
Mo Xiu acknowledged and did not say anything else. This was because Mo Xiu knew that what Mu Qingyi needed the most right now was someone to listen to her.
“My parents wanted me to learn all sorts of knowledge related to skills. They hired specialized teachers to teach me actual combat. They also wanted me to make friends with people that they wanted me to make friends with. Every day, I didn’t have the time to think about certain things or do certain things.”
“Oh.”
“I’m under strict orders from them every day at school. I’m not allowed to make personal friends. I have to go home after school and engage in social engagement during meals. I don’t have a minute that I can control.”
“Oh.”
“Slowly, I felt like I was no longer who I am. Everything about me has been arranged. Maybe that knowledge is important. Maybe I’ll use what my teacher taught me in the future. Maybe the people I make friends with are amazing. But I want to be who I am. I want to make friends at school and go out for a meal after school.”
“Oh.”
“What I wanted was that simple, but I couldn’t get it, so I started training hard. I didn’t go home after school, and I trained until school closed because I felt that I could only break free of these when I was training alone. Only then could I think about some things quietly.”
“Oh.”
“I want to slow down, make life slow down, and enjoy every bit of it.”
“Oh.”
“Mo Xiu.”
“Yes, I’m listening.”
“Do you think I’m wrong? Am I wrong in this powerful era?”
“You can say that you’re wrong. You can also say that this world is wrong.”
“Then who do you think is wrong?”
“This world is wrong!”
Mu Qingyi covered her mouth and laughed lightly. “Hehehe, then what should we do if this world is wrong?”
Mo Xiu looked at Mu Qingyi seriously and said, “Then, we should change this world!”
Mu Qingyi was a little moved when she heard Mo Xiu’s words. She knew that what Mo Xiu said was impossible, and she also knew that he was only saying this to comfort her.
However, Mu Qingyi was still very grateful to Mo Xiu. He had said the words in her heart for the first time. She had even obtained approval from him.
Mu Qingyi leaned towards Mo Xiu.
“Mo Xiu, Mu Qingyi, you guys are here too!”
At some point in time, Liu Ziyang came to the courtyard and saw the two of them.
Mu Qingyi had originally wanted to lean against Mo Xiu’s head, but she immediately pulled her body back. She sat up straight and lowered her head to wipe her tears.
“Mo Xiu, it’s getting late. Go back and rest. It’s been a pleasant day. Thank you.”
Mo Xiu jumped off the rock and said, “I appreciate it too.”
Mu Qingyi was comforted, but so was Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu had been tense all these years, and he had never relaxed.
Just now, he had felt an unprecedented sense of relief. The phrase “change the world” was not a joke. At that moment, Mo Xiu really wanted to change the world.
The two of them walked side by side. When they walked past Liu Ziyang, they pretended that he didn’t exist and walked straight back to their room.
Liu Ziyang scratched his head and muttered, “What’s wrong with these two people? Don’t tell me that they’re sleepwalking?”


                    



The Current State of Humanity
In the teachers’ room in the courtyard…
Wang Yu frowned and said, “Elder Tang, Mo Xiu is indeed a little strange.”
Elder Tang, who was lying on the bed, immediately sat up when he heard this.
“Tell me, tell me!”
“In class this morning, when I used my X-Ray Vision to observe Mo Xiu, I discovered that his skill type was actually more of a detection-type skill. However, when he fought with Wang Lei in the afternoon, I could clearly see that when Mo Xiu used his skill, he was more of a warrior for a moment before returning to a detection-type skill.”
Elder Tang stroked his beard as he lowered his head and said, “Interesting, interesting. Back in school, when I saw that he was familiar with the Demonic Eagle’s weakness, I knew that he wasn’t simple. He might have two skills.”
Wang Yu added, “But this doesn’t mean anything. My X-Ray Vision isn’t that accurate when determining the type of a skill. When I look at Wang Lei, there are times when his skill seems like an assassin-type skill.”
Old Tang nodded and said, “It’s okay. Five it a try tomorrow. You can say this tomorrow…”
The next morning.
“Today, I want to talk about the current state of humanity.”
“You might want to ask, do we still need to talk about the current state of humanity? It’s like this now, because your generation hasn’t come into contact with the previous world.”
“This continent used to be Asia. During the war, the three superpowers formed an alliance, which is the current Human Alliance.”
“After the war, humans and wild beasts signed a contract to be exempted from war. Humans live in the central area of the continent, while wild beasts live on the periphery.”
“The high-tech weapons used by humans have basically disappeared. The reason for their disappearance is that they have limited killing power against wild beasts, but they are very harmful to humans. Thus, they were sealed to prevent civil war from happening.”
Liu Ziyang asked, “Teacher, I heard that we humans used to have a weapon called a nuclear bomb that could render an island lifeless. Is it useless against wild beasts?”
“It works, but it does more harm than good. In the early days of the war, humans used nuclear bombs. However, damage would only be caused at the center of the explosion. Meanwhile, the radiation generated by the explosion would cause the beasts to evolve a second time.”
“There’s another reason, and that is riot. After the war, there were a lot of riots. In order to quell the riots, all weapons were banned.”
Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, humans have better inland resources compared to the beasts. Why didn’t we expand outwards all these years?”
Wang Yu replied, “Humans have abundant resources, but we are essentially sealed off.”
“You may not know this, but there are a total of five continents on Earth. Before the war, the five continents were interconnected. But now, humans have not been able to leave the territory of the Alliance.”
“There’s another reason why I said that we have been sealed off. It’s because there’s no news. You might ask, everyone has a cell phone now, and there is also a lot of news on the Internet. Why is there no news?”
“This is because the news from the other four continents has been cut off. Thus, we have no way of knowing what is happening outside the territory of the Alliance. We don’t even know if the other continents still exist.”
Mo Xiu frowned and asked, “Teacher, can our cell phone signals be blocked? Also, I read that the aerospace industry was developing well before the war. Humans have many artificial satellites too. Can’t we know what’s happening outside?”
Wang Yu smiled bitterly and said, “The strongest people on this planet are not humans or beasts, but the terrifying Sea Race.”
Mo Xiu was familiar with the Sea Race. According to the textbooks, the origin of all the meteorites was in the hands of the Sea Race.
“A large part of the reason the beasts reconciled with us was because the Sea Race was too dangerous.”
“Do you know how big the Pacific Ocean is?”
The four of them shook their heads.
“The Pacific Ocean occupies a third of the Earth. Furthermore, before the war, humans only explored less than five percent of the Pacific Ocean. At that point, we didn’t know what kind of horrible creatures existed in the deep sea. Now, we’re even more afraid to imagine how terrifying those deep-sea creatures would become after being exposed to radiation.”
“The Sea Race destroyed our artificial satellites and blocked our communication signals with their ultrasonic waves. This is the tyrannical method of the Sea Race.”
“Students, don’t be deceived by the peace you see in front of you. This is the result of the hard work of our predecessors. Peace will not last forever. This world is too big, so big that we cannot imagine it.”
Mo Xiu admired Wang Yu from the bottom of his heart. Every lesson provided him with a new understanding of the world.
If his explanation of skills over the past two days could improve Mo Xiu’s understanding, then his explanation of the human situation today widened Mo Xiu’s horizons.
There was very little to talk about today. There was only a bit of content, but there were many questions. The four of them kept asking Wang Yu to explain what the world was like.
Mo Xiu looked towards Mu Qingyi. Yesterday, he had told this woman that he wanted to change the world. Was he too naive?
It was unknown when Mu Qingyi had looked towards Mo Xiu as well. The corners of her lips curled up into a sweet smile.
How wonderful was that? At this moment, Mo Xiu actually felt that it wasn’t impossible to change the world. This was for the sake of his family and friends, so that they could live a stable life, and for the sake of maintaining such a beautiful life.
…
In the afternoon, in the courtyard.
Wang Lei and Wang Yu took out two chairs and sat on them.
Wang Yu said, “In the future, I will watch the battles every day. I will explain to you the rules of today’s individual battle.”
“You will split into two groups. Wang Lei will choose your groups for the individual battle. There is only one condition to decide victory — when either side loses consciousness or admits defeat.”
The corners of Mo Xiu’s mouth twitched. Wasn’t this rule too simple and crude? There were no restrictions, and the conditions for victory were so cruel.
Wang Lei looked at the four of them and said, “Next is the grouping. The first group will be Liu Ziyang against Yue Yuan, and the second group will be Mo Xiu against Mu Qingyi.”
Mo Xiu frowned. After making the calculations last night, he obtained the results. Mu Qingyi was the hardest to deal with.
Mu Qingyi’s attack power was insufficient, but that was when she was attacking Wang Lei. If she were to fight against Mo Xiu and the other two, the power of her flying daggers would not be small.
Coupled with her ever-changing Spatial Folding technique, she was definitely the most difficult to deal with among them.
“First group, get ready!”
Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi retreated to the side to watch the battle. Then, Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan entered the arena, and the two pulled away from each other.
“Get ready… Begin!”
An array appeared beneath Yue Yuan’s feet. The yellow color meant that it was an earth array. Yue Yuan first increased his own defense.
Liu Ziyang said to Wang Lei and Wang Yu unhappily, “Teachers, he cheated. He released his skills before the competition started.”
Yue Yuan’s skill would automatically activate two seconds after it was used. Everyone knew this. The fact that he had enhanced his attributes right after the start of the battle meant that Yue Yuan had released his skill in advance.
Wang Yu shrugged and said, “Didn’t you hear my rules? There are no restrictions. It doesn’t matter even if he dug a trap last night.”
Liu Ziyang looked at the two teachers with his mouth agape. Yue Yuan would not let go of this opportunity. While Liu Ziyang’s attention was not on him, he ran over and started a melee battle.
Liu Ziyang saw that Yue Yuan not only acted shamelessly but also launched a sneak attack. He gritted his teeth in anger and dodged Yue Yuan’s attack.
Mo Xiu had never understood how Liu Ziyang, who was so fat, had the physique of an assassin.
Furthermore, judging from the usual battles, he wasn’t slow either. He might even be faster than Mo Xiu, when Mo Xiu did not activate his skills.
Melee combat wasn’t their forte, but Liu Ziyang still had the advantage of speed.
He struck Yue Yuan many times. However, with the support of the array, Yue Yuan did not suffer any serious injuries.
Neither of them wanted to use their skills first. They both knew that whoever used their skills first would lose.
Just like that, this battle became a protracted battle…


                    



The Terrifying Mu Qingyi
Unknowingly, the two of them had been fighting for more than 20 minutes, but there was still no winner.
In terms of endurance, Yue Yuan was better. After all, Liu Ziyang was too heavy.
Slowly, Liu Ziyang stopped dodging and moving like he did in the beginning. Instead, his footsteps became slower and slower. In the end, he barely moved and relied on the flexibility of his hands to hold on.
When Liu Ziyang stopped moving, Yue Yuan knew that his chance had come.
Suddenly, an array appeared under Liu Ziyang’s feet with a flash of fire. It was a fire array!
The moment the fire array erupted, Liu Ziyang turned into a shadow and appeared on Yue Yuan’s left in the next second.
Liu Ziyang held a dagger and felt that victory was in sight. However, unexpectedly, three consecutive rays of light appeared under his feet.
The first was the wood array, which controlled Liu Ziyang. The next two were fire arrays, which dealtz two waves of damage to Liu Ziyang.
Liu Ziyang was already exhausted. Thus, the damage from the two fire arrays caused him to lose his combat ability.
Liu Ziyang simply laid on the ground and shouted, “I admit defeat.”
Wang Yu announced the results.
“Yue Yuan is the winner!”
Liu Ziyang forced himself to sit up and said, “I don’t understand how you knew that I would appear there and set up the array beforehand.”
Yue Yuan said, “As an array master, I’m proficient in setting up traps. You didn’t have any stamina then. When I released the fire array, you would definitely use your skill.”
“The key is where you will appear again after using the skill. If your stamina is insufficient, you will definitely not let go of the opportunity after using the skill.”
“There are three places you can go, namely behind me and on both sides of me. However, you knew that I would be most wary of my back, while my right is where my dominant hand is. Thus, I gambled that you would appear on my left. One second after I placed the first fire array, you appeared. At that time, I set up three array formations on my left in succession.”
Liu Ziyang pouted and said, “How f*cking sinister. He’s even more sinister than an assassin like me.”
Yue Yuan’s skill was more suitable in a team setting. He didn’t have any advantage in the individual battle, but actually used schemes to win.
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but take another look at Yue Yuan. In the previous battle with Wang Lei, it had always been Mo Xiu who had arranged the battle tactics. He didn’t expect Yue Yuan to have such strong analytical abilities.
Although Mo Xiu did not know how many times Yue Yuan could set up the array, he guessed that there was a limit to how many times he could set it up.
In reality, after Yue Yuan activated his skill, no matter what kind of array he used, he could only set up five arrays before entering a state of cooldown.
Although Liu Ziyang did not say it explicitly, everyone could tell that Liu Ziyang’s speed would increase after he released his afterimage. Therefore, Yue Yuan could only gamble this time.
While everyone was still reminiscing about this battle, Wang Yu had already announced the next battle.
Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi arrived at the scene. At this moment, Mo Xiu’s skill was still God’s Eye. Thus, he immediately used it on Mu Qingyi.
“First Skill: Spatial Folding.”
“Skill Effect: (1) Flash: Affects the user. Allows the user to teleport. (2) Object Control: Affects objects. Can cause objects to move twice in three seconds.
“Cooldown: Five seconds (When Object Control is activated, the second movement of an object will not be subject to cooldown).”
For the first time, Mo Xiu had doubts about God’s Eye. It was already terrifying enough that she could teleport, but the cooldown time was only five seconds?
In other words, if Mo Xiao wanted to win, he could only dodge Mu Qingyi’s two teleporting daggers and then defeat her within five seconds.
“Get ready… Begin!”
Mo Xiu did not hesitate and instantly activated Descent of the Martial God. Then, he closed the distance between him and Mu Qingyi at full speed.
Mo Xiu understood that Mu Qingyi used long-range attacks. Thus, the shorter the distance between the two, the greater his chance of victory.
Mu Qingyi stood where she was. She took out a flying dagger from her waist with her right hand and threw it out lightly.
The moment the flying dagger left her hand, it burst through the air at a shocking speed. Mo Xiu knew that the flying dagger was definitely not as simple as it seemed.
Mu Qingyi must have used some sort of special method to exert force when she was throwing the dagger. The dagger looked very light, but in reality, it was moving very quickly.
The flying dagger headed straight for Mo Xiu’s forehead. Mo Xiu originally did not want to dodge, but Mu Qingyi would definitely change the direction of the flying dagger.
However, as the flying dagger approached him, Mo Xiu had no choice but to slow down and dodge.
As Mo Xiu slowed down, the flying dagger disappeared. Mo Xiu didn’t dare to advance rashly and could only search for the flying dagger.
Then, Mo Xiu turned around and realized that the flying dagger was flying towards him from behind.
Mo Xiu frowned. Why did she move the flying dagger so far away? She should have let the flying dagger appear closer to him so that he would be caught off guard.
Mo Xiu stared at the flying dagger. When the flying dagger approached him, he dodged to the side and prepared to grab it with his hands.
However, the flying dagger disappeared once again. This time, it only moved a short distance away from its original position and appeared right in front of Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu couldn’t dodge in time and could only lie down, barely dodging the attack.
At this moment, Mo Xiu was lying on the ground, looking extremely pathetic.
Mu Qingyi’s skill was too troublesome. If Mo Xiu did not know her skill, he might have already been injured.
Mo Xiu, who stood up, suddenly thought of something and looked towards Mu Qingyi.
Mo Xiu thought to himself, “Oh no, I’ve been tricked!” When Mu Qingyi activated Object Control and used it for the first time, the skill would enter a cooldown period. At this point, more than five seconds had passed. This meant that her skill had been refreshed and could be used again.
So that was the case. Mo Xiu was enlightened. She had moved the flying dagger further away just now to buy more time to activate the second displacement.
Before Mo Xiu could prepare himself, Mu Qingyi threw out a second flying dagger.
Mo Xiu already knew Mu Qingyi’s strategy. By utilizing the three second interval between the two displacements, he could almost use his skills indefinitely.
Mo Xiu would no longer give Mu Qingyi the chance to exhaust him and stall for time.
Ignoring the incoming flying daggers, he directly ran towards Mu Qingyi.
This time, when the flying dagger approached Mo Xiu, Mo Xiu did not slow down. He only tilted his head and the flying dagger went right past his face.
Mo Xiu silently counted down in his heart as the flying dagger disappeared and began to move. He started to calculate the cooldown time for Mu Qingyi’s skill.
Five…
This time, the flying dagger appeared behind Mo Xiu, but it wasn’t that far away. It was just a short distance away.
Mo Xiu glanced back and continued accelerating, preparing to race against the flying dagger.
Four…
Mo Xiu was not as fast as the flying dagger. The flying dagger approached him.
Then, Mo Xiu did something that no one expected. He quickly rolled on the ground to reduce his speed as much as possible while dodging the flying dagger.
Three…
The flying dagger disappeared once more and moved again. Right now, Mo Xiu was only a step away from My Qingyi.
Mu Qingyi was currently controlling the flying dagger to perform a second displacement. Thus, she was unable to divert her attention to dodge.
Two…
Mu Qingyi was within reach, but at that moment, the flying dagger had also appeared in front of Mo Xiu’s chest.
In Mu Qingyi’s opinion, it did not matter even if she could not avoid Mo Xiu’s attack. After all, this time, the flying dagger was aimed at Mo Xiu’s heart. Thus, Mo Xiu would definitely dodge it.
One…
As the flying knife flew past, Mo Xiu’s fist flew towards Mu Qingyi and stopped a centimeter away from her face. The wind from his fist blew Mu Qingyi’s hair away.
After a second of silence, Mu Qingyi said, “I lost.”
Mo Xiu had indeed dodged the flying dagger, but he had dodged it in a very strange manner.
He crossed his legs and his entire body was tilted sideways, like a crab.
The flying dagger brushed past Mo Xiu’s chest and cut open his clothes.
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “You held back. Otherwise, the outcome would have been hard to predict.”
Mu Qingyi had indeed held back during the last displacement, giving Mo Xiu time to dodge.
Mo Xiu knew that even if he did not hold back, he would still win. However, he would be severely injured.
Off the battlefield, Wang Lei and Wang Yu looked at each other in shock.
How did he manage to dodge the two extreme attacks? How did he manage to move sideways like a crab?
This was unbelievable. Right now, both of them only had one thought in their minds.
Mo Xiu was a natural warrior…


                    



Natural Warrior
This battle was deliberately arranged by Wang Lei and Wang Yi. After all, Mu Qingyi and Mo Xiu were the closest in terms of their individual strength.
Mu Qingyi would slightly restrain Mo Xiu, who did not have any long-range attacks. According to their deductions, Mu Qingyi would win with a slight advantage.
However, the outcome of this battle wasn’t just unexpected. During the battle, Mo Xiu’s decisiveness and extreme maneuvering were equally astonishing.
For a moment, there was silence.
“Mo Xiu wins! Today’s combat class ends here.”
Wang Lei’s voice broke the silence. Then, Mo Xiu and the rest headed to their own rooms.
Wang Lei said, “Wang Yu, what is your recent research project?”
Wang Yu adjusted his glasses and stared intently at Mo Xiu’s back.
“Recently, I’ve been researching the conditions and other patterns involved in the awakening of two skills.”
Their voices weren’t soft, and Mo Xiu heard their conversation clearly.
When he heard about the other forms involved in the awakening of two skills, his heart tightened. Could it be that his possession of two skills had been discovered? After all, this was his greatest secret.
Mo Xiu suppressed his emotions and returned to his room.
Wang Lei and Wang Lei also returned to their room.
The moment they entered their room, Wang Yu said, “Elder Tang, Mo Xiu did not react to what I said.”
Elder Tang stroked his beard and said, “I saw it. This child is not simple. Regardless of whether he has a second skill or not, he is a rare talent.”
At this moment, Wang Lei interjected, “Mo Xiu’s improvisation in the battle just now was too shocking. Even I wouldn’t be able to react in that extreme situation.”
Elder Tang nodded and said, “Yes, Mo Xiu’s strength does not solely come from his hard work. He is a genius. He’s born to be a warrior.”
…
Mo Xiu, who had returned to his room, sat down on the bed in a panic.
“Have I been discovered? Does God’s Eye really have a trigger effect that I don’t know about?”
After some serious thought, Mo Xiu slowly calmed down.
If he was really discovered, there was no need for Wang Yu to test him. He could simply talk to Mo Xiu.
His conversation with Wang Lei was either a coincidence or an attempt at probing.
It was very likely that he was being probed. If anyone was probing him, then it must be Elder Tang.
Elder Tang must have other motives for giving him such a great opportunity and bringing him to the Cosmic Tuition Class for no reason.
“That’s not right. If the Wang brothers said that it was arranged by Elder Tang, then Elder Tang is…”
…
Wang Lei, Wang Yu, and Elder Tang were talking when someone suddenly knocked on the door.
Knock, knock, knock!
Wang Yu frowned. Who could it be at this time?
“Who is it?”
“I am Mo Xiu, and I would like to ask you some questions. Is it convenient for you, Teacher?”
Wang Yu looked at Elder Tang, who did not say anything. Then, he stood up and walked out of the small door.
Wang Yu opened the door and Mo Xiu simply squeezed in.
“Teacher, I have some questions that I can’t figure out. I would like to ask you.”
Wang Yu gestured for Mo Xiu to sit down before speaking any further.
Mo Xiu observed the room. It was very large and had four beds. There were also tables and chairs.
Wang Yu also sat down and said, “If you have any questions, just ask.”
After Mo Xiu sat down, he said respectfully, “Why is there a difference in the strength of people’s skills? Previously, you said that everyone’s skills have their uses. However, I’ve seen many useless skills, such as increasing your strength by 5% or understanding the language of pheasants.”
Wang Yu replied, “Not everyone can get into a university, but they can have strong abilities. Some people’s skills are more suitable for production. It might be useless to increase their strength by 5% in battle, but it might be very useful in labor. It’s precisely because of these ordinary and selfless people that we can have a better training environment.”
Mo Xiu looked enlightened and said, “Teacher, I have other questions…”
After that, Mo Xiu asked a bunch of irrelevant questions before pretending that he had benefited greatly.
As soon as Mo Xiu left, Elder Tang came in from the back door and sat at the seat Mo Xiu had been sitting at.
“Hahaha, Mo Xiu is interesting. I was the one probing him, but now he’s probing us.”
Wang Yu nodded and said, “Elder Tang, this child, Mo Xiu, is not simple. He must have noticed something. The moment he entered, he observed the layout of the room.”
“When he asked his questions just now, although he did it very discreetly, I could still tell that he was carefully observing every detail in the room. After asking a few questions, he would take a look at other locations.”
At the side, Wang Lei also said, “I could see it too. He clearly saw through our attempt at probing and came specifically to find us.”
Not only did Mo Xiu’s actions not make Elder Tang angry, Elder Tang even smiled smugly.
“Hahaha, this little fellow is interesting. Since I’ve been discovered, I’ll leave.”
Wang Yu asked, “Elder Tang, do you need us to continue testing Mo Xiu after you leave?”
“There’s no need. Your mission has changed. Not only must you not probe him, you must also help him protect his own secrets.”
Wang Lei and Wang Yu looked at each other. What was the meaning of this? Didn’t Elder Tang get Mo Xiu into the Cosmic Tuition Class to find out Mo Xiu’s secret?
Then, Elder Tang’s next sentence completely shocked the two of them.
“You can say that Mo Xiu is my disciple to outsiders. Hahaha, I finally have a successor.”
Mo Xiu did not know what happened after that. After returning to his room, he felt that his guess was correct.
Elder Tang was at the Cosmic Tuition Class. Furthermore, he was staying in the teachers’ room.
Mo Xiu had taken a closer look at the room earlier and found that there were only Wang Lei and Wang Yu in the room. However, there were obvious signs of habitation on three beds, which meant that one more person was staying there.
Mo Xiu was still preparing for the battle of wits and courage with Elder Tang in the future. Little did he know that Elder Tang had already left the Cosmic Tuition Class.
…
The next morning was also the fourth day since Mo Xiu arrived.
Just like the past few days, Wang Yu arrived at the classroom on time.
“The original plan was to give you a detailed explanation of wild beasts today, but after much consideration, I decided not to. You don’t need this knowledge now, and telling you will only increase the pressure on you.”
“Today’s last lesson has no content. It’s simply a question and answer session. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. As long as it’s something that I know, I will tell you anything that I understand.”
Although there was no theory class today, the entire morning was not wasted. Everyone kept asking questions.
In particular, Mo Xiu had the most questions. Mo Xiu knew that he had the least knowledge and didn’t want to waste this opportunity. Therefore, he would ask any questions he had.
After class, Mo Xiu asked, “Teacher, you said today is the last lesson, so what should we do in the morning after today?”
Wang Yu smiled mischievously and said, “I told you on the first day that the primary task of the tuition class is to improve your combat ability. From tomorrow onwards, you will attend the combat class for the entire day.”
They were a little troubled. It was not that they did not want to take the combat class. After all, the combat class was very beneficial to everyone, but it also consumed a lot of energy.
A few days ago, the combat class in the afternoon had made everyone tired. In the future, the combat class would last a whole day. It seemed like everyone would have a hard time.
In the afternoon, the four of them stood together and waited for Wang Lei and Wang Yu’s orders.
The two of them sat on the chairs and whispered to each other.
Liu Ziyang might not be convinced of his defeat yesterday. Thus, he volunteered to say, “Teacher, who am I going to fight today?”
Wang Lei said unhappily, “Who are you going to fight? Did I say that there will be individual battles today?”


                    



The Second Lesson
???
Mo Xiu was also a little confused. The first individual battle had just taken place yesterday. Logically speaking, everyone should fight against each other once.
However, Mo Xiu had forgotten that common sense did not exist after coming to the Cosmic Tuition Class.
Wang Lei continued, “You guys are very outstanding. The second lesson is over.”
“The second lesson is to familiarize yourself with your skills. From yesterday’s match, all of you have a certain personal understanding of your skills. Today, we will be having a team battle.”
A team battle? The four of them sighed at how Wang Lei and Wang Yu had so many tricks up their sleeves. Why did they come up with another team battle?
Next, Wang Yu began to explain the rules.
“Let’s add something fun to the team battle. There’s only one rule this time — snatch the flag!”
“Snatch the flag?”
Usually, there would be some group battles in university. However, the rules of the competition would be that a team would achieve victory when no members of the opposing team were on the field. They had never heard of team battles or snatching the flag.
Wang Yu continued, “That’s right, the rules are…”
“Firstly, each team will have a small flag. The team members will decide who they place the flag on. When the member with the flag on them goes out of bounds, the opposing team will win.”
“Secondly, if the person that goes out of bounds doesn’t have a flag on them, they will enter the waiting area and be revived in one minute.”
“Thirdly, if you are knocked down by the opponent, you will be eliminated.”
Wang Lei used a pile of chairs to form a circle and created an opening in the circle. Then, he said, “This is the revival area. As for the groups, Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang will form one team, while Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan will form the other team.”
After that, he handed the two palm-sized flags to the two teams. The moment the four of them saw the flags, they understood that the key to victory was to hide the flags and not let the opponents know who held them.
After that, Wang Yu gave each team half an hour to discuss their tactics.
Mo Xiu could still use God’s Eye once. He didn’t choose to use it on Yue Yuan, but on Liu Ziyang instead.
Mo Xiu basically knew Yue Yuan’s skills. Furthermore, at times like this, understanding his teammates’ skills was more important.
“First Skill: Afterimage.”
“Skill Effect: When the user is attacked, the user turns into an afterimage. After one second, the user can choose to appear anywhere within a one-meter radius of their original position. After triggering the skill, the user’s first critical hit (attack power is doubled) will increase by 50%.”
“Duration: One minute (User’s speed enhances state).”
“Cooldown: 2 hours.”
Unexpectedly, the fatty Liu Ziyang typically did not seem clever, but he had hidden most of his skills.
When he introduced the skill, Liu Ziyang did not say that his speed would increase after releasing the skill, nor did he mention anything about critical hits.
After what had happened yesterday, Mo Xiu wasn’t as careful when using the God’s Eye.
The discovery of Elder Tang’s presence was also beneficial. At least it proved that Elder Tang, Wang Lei, and Wang Yu had no evidence to prove that he had a second skill. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have probed him yesterday.
Hence, in the future, Mo Xiu would be able to use God’s Eyes openly. Even someone like Wang Yu would not be able to see through it. No one in this world would be able to.
Half an hour later, the four of them entered the arena.
Wang Lei and Wang Yu took out a table and started munching on melon seeds. They didn’t look like teachers at all.
“Begin!”
At the start of the competition, the four of them did not use any skills and entered the probing stage.
Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang were the first to move. The two of them moved apart.
This was because Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan’s skills were very suitable for engaging in teamwork.
If the combination of Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang was like adding one and one to produce two, then the result of Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan teaming up was more than two.
Thus, Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang separated at the start as they wanted Mu Qingyi and Liu Ziyang to split up and deal with them. They wanted to form two groups, with each member of the group fighting each other one-on-one.
Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang were not too far away from each other. If Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan chose to attack one person at the same time, they could quickly provide support to each other.
Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang slowly approached Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan from both sides.
Meanwhile, Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan two didn’t seem to notice Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang. Instead, they remained indifferent.
Just as Mo Xiu felt that something was wrong, Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan moved at the same time.
They attacked Liu Ziyang at an extremely fast speed, as if they had discussed it beforehand.
Mo Xiu knew that things were not looking good. His entire body flashed with golden light as he activated Descent of the Martial God and rushed to provide support.
However, he was still a step too late. Mu Qingyi quickly used her flying dagger to block Liu Ziyang’s escape path. Meanwhile, Yue Yuan had set up an array in advance.
The ground below Liu Ziyang’s feet flashed. After the array was triggered, he was frozen.
Next, Mu Qingyi used the back of her flying dagger to hit Liu Ziyang’s shoulder, causing him to fall to the ground.
In the end, Mo Xiu’s speed could not compare to that of the flying dagger. He could only watch as Liu Ziyang was eliminated.
It wasn’t that Liu Ziyang couldn’t dodge. Instead, he didn’t want to use his skills so easily.
Perhaps it was because everything happened too suddenly. Wang Yu only reacted after a second and said, “Liu Ziyang is out of bounds. The competition continues.”
The competition continued. This meant that the flag wasn’t on Liu Ziyang, but on Mo Xiu.
Liu Ziyang immediately came to the revival area. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu also jumped back to pull away from Mu Qingyi.
It was now two against one. Mo Xiu didn’t have the confidence to defeat the two of them, so he wanted to stall for time until Liu Ziyang revived.
However, Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan did something unexpected.
The two of them did not choose to seize the moment to attack. Instead, they stood at the entrance of the revival area.
Even Mo Xiu couldn’t help but sigh.
“F*ck, are you guys trying to collect the corpse?”
Yue Yuan said, “Why? Did the rules say that we can’t guard the corpse?”
Mo Xiu didn’t have the confidence to defeat the two of them. Neither did they have the confidence to defeat Mo Xiu within a minute.
It was better to guard the revival area. Once Liu Ziyang came out, they would defeat him. As long as they could drag it out until the time limit of Mo Xiu’s skill was up, they could naturally win easily.
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but say, “Yue Yuan, aren’t you too shameless?”
Yue Yuan looked towards Mu Qingyi, who grinned and said, “Mo Xiu, this was my idea.”
Mo Xiu said awkwardly, “Isn’t that a little despicable?”
As soon as these words came out, Yue Yuan was unhappy. If it was his idea, it would be shameless. However, if it was Mu Qingyi’s idea, then it was a little despicable. Why was this the case?
Yue Yuan pouted and said, “Mo Xiu, your double standards are too much.”
Mo Xiu also felt that his words were inappropriate and decided not to explain.
However, the problem Mo Xiu was facing now was not small. It was as if Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan were sitting at ease in a fishing boat despite the storms.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu was in a dilemma. If he attacked now, it would be difficult for him to win against two opponents. However, if he didn’t attack now, they would be able to stall for time.
Time passed. Neither side made a move. For a moment, the battlefield was in a deadlock.
Wang Lei asked Wang Yu who was beside him, “Shouldn’t we let them snatch the flag and let them compete normally? This is obviously a pure battle of wits.”
Wang Yu chewed on the melon seeds in his hand and looked at the arena seriously.
“Brother, your actual combat ability is very strong. What you lack is the ability to set up traps. Just watch, the show is about to begin. Watch carefully. It might end in the blink of an eye.”
Mo Xiu calculated the amount of time that had passed. It was almost time for Liu Ziyang to revive. He couldn’t delay any longer.
Step by step, he walked towards Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan.
When Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan saw that Mo Xiu had moved, they also perked up, knowing that the time for the decisive battle had arrived.
“Time’s up. Liu Ziyang has been revived!”


                    



A Fake Move
“Time’s up. Liu Ziyang has been revived!”
When Liu Ziyang heard that he had been revived, he did not walk out immediately. Instead, he paused for a second to prevent Yue Yuan from setting up an array.
Sure enough, with a flash from the ground, an array was triggered. Liu Ziyang successfully dodged it.
However, Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan were really too close. The moment Liu Ziyang came out, the two of them did not use any more skills and directly attacked him.
At this moment, Mo Xiu also took the opportunity to arrive in front of the three of them. Meanwhile, when Liu Ziyang saw that the two of them were attacking, he immediately used his skill, Afterimage.
Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan looked left and right. They thought that Liu Ziyang would appear near the two of them so that he could attack at the same time as Mo Xiu.
However, they didn’t expect Liu Ziyang to appear behind Mo Xiu. Then, Mo Xiu took out his flag and passed it to Liu Ziyang.
Yue Yuan shouted, “Not good!” He stepped forward to interfere, but Liu Ziyang had already run far away.
Currently, Liu Ziyang was holding the flag in the distance, while Mo Xiu faced Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan alone.
The situation had been reversed. Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan did not expect that Mo Xiu would choose to help Liu Ziyang escape and face the two of them alone.
The two of them were also clear that even though Mo Xiu was unlikely to defeat both of them, it was not a problem for him to eliminate Mu Qingyi in a one-on-one battle.
If only Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang were left to fight, Yue Yuan had already used the array twice, while Liu Ziyang was still very energetic. Thus, Yue Yuan’s chances of winning were not high.
Yue Yuan decisively released two array formations around Mo Xiu and grabbed him.
“Mu Qingyi, go!”
Mu Qingyi ran forward, while Mo Xiu broke free from Yue Yuan and dodged two array formations as he chased after Mu Qingyi.
When Mu Qingyi saw that Mo Xiu did not choose to eliminate Yue Yuan first and was instead heading towards her, she immediately activated her skill and moved the flag into Yue Yuan’s hands.
Yue Yuan, who received the flag, stopped and hid it behind his back.
Right now, Mo Xiu was about to catch Mu Qingyi, but when he saw that Yue Yuan did not chase after him, he immediately turned around and changed directions.
Mu Qingyi also saw Mo Xiu’s actions and immediately activated the second displacement. She kept the small flag in her hand and turned around to continue attacking Liu Ziyang.
At this moment, Mu Qingyi heard two voices.
“Watch your back!”
“Sorry!”
The first shout was from Yue Yuan, and it was very loud. The second was from Mo Xiu behind Mu Qingyi, and his voice was very soft.
Mu Qingyi turned around abruptly, but she was still too slow.
Mo Xiu pushed Mu Qingyi’s shoulders with his right hand, his legs wrapped around Mu Qingyi’s body as he quickly placed Mu Qingyi on the ground.
Although Mu Qingyi was not weak, Mo Xiu’s speed and strength were much greater than hers thanks to his skill, Descent of the Martial God.
At this moment, Wang Yu stood up and announced, “Mu Qingyi has been eliminated. The competition has ended.”
Mu Qingyi quickly stood up and stared at Mo Xiu.
His gaze seemed to be saying, “You clearly went back to deal with Yue Yuan. Why were you behind me?”
In reality, Mo Xiu had only pretended and acted as if wanted to attack Yue Yuan. In reality, he had merely turned around and returned.
Furthermore, the key to their victory lay in this feint.
Wang Lei sighed and said, “It was indeed exciting. This kid, Mo Xiu, always brings us surprises. Wang Yu, did you guess this would be the outcome?”
Wang Yu shook his head and said, “No. I just knew that the outcome would be decided soon, but I didn’t expect it to be determined so soon.”
Wang Yu stood up and said to the audience, “Mo Xiu, tell me, how did you win?”
“Actually, I just made a fake move to make Mu Qingyi think that I went back to attack Yue Yuan.”
Mu Qingyi pouted and said with a puzzled expression, “I know that, but how did you know that the flag was with me?”
Mu Qingyi and Yue Yuan were somewhat unhappy that they had lost just like that. In their eyes, Mo Xiu had made the right bet just now by choosing Mu Qingyi out of the two of them. If he had made the wrong bet, it would be hard to predict who would win.
Mo Xiu explained, “It’s very simple. I only thought about it from another perspective. What would I do if I were Mu Qingyi?”
“I would hold the flag. Thanks to the Spatial Folding skill, I would be able to teleport the flag to my teammate the moment it falls to the ground. This way, nothing would go wrong.”
“That’s why the flag was definitely in Mu Qingyi’s hands at the start. After confirming this point, the rest were all improvised.”
“When I faced the two of you alone, Mu Qingyi went to chase after Liu Ziyang, while Yue Yuan stayed behind to pester me. This shows that Yue Yuan was not afraid of being eliminated. It also means that the small flag was still in Mu Qingyi’s hands.”
“Next, I went to chase after Mu Qingyi. Yue Yuan stopped after a few steps, when I was about to attack Mu Qingyi. Even so, Mu Qingyi did not use any skills to counterattack, so there was only one possibility.”
The few of them listened attentively.
“That meant that Mu Qingyi had already used her skill, so she can’t use her skill anymore. That’s why I judged that Mu Qingyi had shifted the small flag to Yue Yuan’s body.”
Mu Qingyi asked again, “Since you knew that the flag was with Yue Yuan now, why didn’t you really attack him? Why did you use a fake move to trick me? Could it be that…”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “That’s right. The last time we fought, I knew that you had two skills, so I purposely made a fake move to let you take back the flag.”
Mu Qingyi rolled her eyes. “How cunning!”
Wang Yu came to the center of the arena and said, “In this team battle, we wanted you guys to combine strategies with actual combat. In the beginning, Mo Xiu’s team placed too much emphasis on actual combat, while Mu Qingyi’s team placed too much emphasis on strategy. However, the two members in Mo Xiu’s team combined both elements well towards the end. Meanwhile, Mu Qingyi’s team still focused on strategy, so they lost.”
Wang Lei looked at Wang Yu in surprise. Wasn’t this nonsense? How had Mo Xiu combined strategy into his actions?
Could it be that letting Liu Ziyang take the flag and watching the show by the side was his scheme? The key to victory in this battle was Mo Xiu’s ability to adapt on the spot.
When Wang Yu saw the look in Wang Lei’s eyes, he immediately gave him a look, telling him that the students were all here, so he shouldn’t undermine him.
Wang Lei added, “This is the third lesson on combinations. You have learned to combine strategy and actual combat, and to combine the skills of your teammates.”
Wang Yu continued, “Alright, that’s all for today. Everyone has their flaws in this battle. Go back and summarize what you have learned.”
…
In the evening, on a rock outside the courtyard…
Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi sat there to chat.
Ever since that conversation, the two of them had a tacit understanding. They would sit here every night for a while.
There were times when they chatted, while there were other times when they sat quietly.
“Mo Xiu, can you summarize the inadequacies of today’s battle? I’ll learn from you too.”
“I don’t think my team had any tactics. Instead, we wanted to win by fighting. That’s my weakness.”
“What about mine? What mistakes did I make today?”
“Do you want the truth, or do you want lies?”
“Tell me the lies first!”
“You were simply flawless. If I didn’t guess correctly at the last moment, you guys would have won.”
“Hahaha, what about the truth?”
“Your methods were very lousy.”
“Hmph! Why were they lousy?”
“Under such rules, your skill is practically a divine weapon. However, you were desperate to display this advantage, so you didn’t show your true strength.”
“Yes. Although the lie sounds good, I still like to hear the truth.”
The two of them looked at the moon in silence.
Mu Qingyi suddenly felt a little sad. She lowered her head and said, “Mo Xiu, the college entrance examination is coming up soon. Which university are you planning to enter?”
“I’m going to Yanjing University. What about you?”
“I might go somewhere far away. Will we meet again?”
“Of course, as long as you want to!”


                    



The Crazy Wang Xuanhu
At the training grounds of Shun City First High School.
The day before yesterday, the entire school held their final mock exam before the college entrance examination.
In the previous mock exam, since some students had yet to awaken their skills, there was no skill assessment.
The last mock examination was the only test that included the skill assessment. In other words, the results of this test would be very similar to the results of the college entrance examination.
Every student placed great importance on this exam. They would not hide their abilities.
Today was the day for the results to be released. The school rankings were posted on the noticeboard in front of the field.
This announcement caused a sensation in the entire school.
In the past, the top two students in every mock exam were Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi. For the entire year, no one in the Year 3 batch had been able to do anything.
This time, the first two names were unfamiliar.
Wag Xuanhu was in first place, with a total score of 910 points.
Meanwhile, Liu Qingyu was in second place, with a total score of 893 points.
The maximum score for the college entrance examination was 1,000 points. In the history of the school, there were very few people who scored more than 900 points. Thus, the results of these two people were a little exaggerated.
Although Wang Xuanhu was among the top five of Year 3 Class 1 and had gotten third place many times, he had never entered the top ten in the entire school.
Liu Qing Yu was even more exaggerated. He had never entered the top hundred before.
Thus, the sudden rise of these two people caused quite a stir in the school.
As for the disappearance of Mu Qingyi and Mo Xiu, there were also some rumors.
The rumors about Mu Qingyi were more uniform. After all, everyone knew that Mu Qingyi’s family background was very good.
It was rumored that Mu Qingyi had been arranged by her family to transfer to a better high school for her final sprint.
Meanwhile, there were many varied rumors about Mo Xiu’s disappearance.
However, there were two types of rumors. One was from Mo Xiu’s best friend, Zheng Yi. Mo Xiu was arranged to be an exchange student by the school and was currently at another school.
However, there were many loopholes in this rumor. Firstly, the school had never heard of sending exchange students to other schools before. Secondly, even Zheng Yi could not say which school Mo Xiu was currently in.
Most people thought that Zheng Yi was trying to cover for Mo Xiu. Something might have happened to Mo Xiu.
The second rumor was spread by someone else. Mo Xiu had caused trouble outside and offended a big shot. Now, he was crippled and didn’t dare to show his face.
A good deed goes unnoticed, but a scandal spreads quickly. Furthermore, the rumors became more real and detailed over time. In the end, even the process of Mo Xiu being beaten up was described in detail. Some even said that they had seen this scene with their own eyes.
Rumors about Mo Xiu quickly spread to Ye Qian’er.
Ye Qian’er had been sad for a long time because of this. How could her benefactor encounter such a terrible thing?
Because of this, Ye Qian’er deliberately looked for Zheng Yi to ask about Mo Xiu.
Zheng Yi was also very annoyed. When the rumors spread, there was no way he could explain himself. He took out the message he sent to Mo Xiu two days ago and showed it to others, but others said that Mo Xiu was acting with him.
Zheng Yi repeatedly assured Ye Qian’er that Mo Xiu would be fine and would definitely return before the college entrance examination before persuading her to leave.
After Ye Qian’er returned, she explained Mo Xiu’s situation to her class. However, no one listened to her and thought that she was infatuated. They even imagined how Mo Xiu’s return would be like.
Some people were sad, but others were happy. Meanwhile, Wang Xuanhu was the most comfortable person these days.
Wang Xuanhu had a hard time a while ago. When the news of him being taught a lesson by Mo Xiu spread, he no longer had the airs of a young master. The detailed data regarding his skill would even affect his college entrance examination.
He only managed to make a comeback after the results were out. Thus, he felt extremely comfortable now.
Wang Xuanhu’s results were real. The reason why his strength had advanced by leaps and bounds was because his father had found a Spirit Ring for him.
Spirit Rings could directly raise the level of a skill to Level-2. The price of a Spirit Ring could be said to be astronomical. Furthermore, no matter how expensive this item was sold for, there would definitely be people who would buy it. Therefore, the supply would not meet the demand.
Wang Xuanhu’s father had spent almost all of his family fortune to buy this Spirit Ring. After consuming the Spirit Ring, Wang Xuanhu’s skill was upgraded to Level-2. He could even be ranked among the top in other major cities, let alone Shun City.
Now that his results had improved and the impact on his college entrance examination had been resolved, he was overjoyed to hear that Mo Xiu was crippled.
However, Wang Xuanhu was not satisfied. On that day at the training grounds, Mo Xiu had embarrassed him in front of so many people. How could he just let it pass?
However, now that he couldn’t find Mo Xiu for revenge, Wang Xuanhu could only target Zheng Yi.
The next day, at the training grounds of Shun City First High School…
Hundreds of people gathered in the training grounds. They were all attracted by today’s duel.
It was a duel between Zheng Yi, who had previously fought the Demonic Eagle, and Wang Xuanhu, the new king.
Wang Xuanhu had challenged Zheng Yi yesterday. With Zheng Yi’s personality, he naturally would not refuse.
The battle was not as intense as everyone had imagined. The entire process took less than five minutes.
Wang Xuanhu had crushed Zheng Yi.
Zheng Yi lay on the ground and gritted his teeth. “I admit defeat.”
The difference in skill levels was too great. Although Zheng Yi’s skill was very strong, Wang Xuanhu’s original skill was not weak. Coupled with the fact that Wang Xuanhu’s skill was one level higher than Zheng Yi’s, he easily defeated Zheng Yi.
Wang Xuanhu walked over and extended his right hand.
Zheng Yi thought that Wang Xuanhu wanted to help him up. He had just extended his hand when Wang Xuanhu retracted it.
After that, he kicked Zheng Yi’s hand ruthlessly. Zheng Yi was caught off guard. Then, Wang Xuanhu used all his strength, and Zheng Yi rolled on the ground in pain.
“Ah!!! Damn it, bastard.”
Wang Xuanhu kicked him again.
“Who are you talking about? I didn’t hear you clearly.”
Zheng Yi was sweating profusely from the pain. He gritted his teeth and said, “Just you wait!”
“Yo, Eldest Young Master Zheng, why can’t you beat him yourself? Are you looking for revenge?”
Zheng Yi trembled and did not speak anymore. The surrounding spectators also felt that Wang Xuanhu had gone overboard.
One of them came out and said, “Wang Xuanhu, you’ve already won. There’s no need for this, right?”
Wang Xuanhu widened his eyes and roared, “What? Do you have a problem with that? Do you want to come down and spar?”
For a moment, no one dared to speak up for Zheng Yi.
Wang Xuanhu still felt unsatisfied and wanted to kick Zheng Yi again.
“Wait, sparring has always stopped when victory is determined. Why are you forcing him to retaliate like this?”
When Wang Xuanhu heard this, he turned around and saw a thin man wearing glasses squeezing out from the crowd.
Wang Xuanhu said impatiently, “Who are you? Do you also want to exchange a few moves?”
“My name is Liu Qingyu. I’m willing to spar with you.”
“Liu Qingyu?”
Wang Xuanhu recalled that Liu Qingyu was ranked second in the mock exam. He was also on good terms with Mo Xiu.
“Alright, aren’t you willing to stand out? We’ll fight again tomorrow at this time.”
“Sure!”
Wang Xuanhu glared at Liu Qingyu. Then, the crowd immediately made way for him and left.
Liu Qingyu quickly helped Zheng Yi up and asked, “How are you? Are your injuries serious?”
Zheng Yi looked at his right hand and sighed. “Sigh, I’m afraid it’s a little serious.”
Liu Qingyu immediately sent Zheng Yi to the hospital. The test results were not ideal. His right wrist was fractured.
“Zheng Yi, the college entrance examination is coming up soon. I’m afraid that your hand will affect the examination. I have medicine at home that can treat it, but the process is rather painful.”
Zheng Yi’s face was pale. He waved his left hand and said, “I know what medicine you’re talking about. I have it at home. I’ve used it before, so I know how painful it is. This damned Wang Xuanhu.”
Liu Qingyu shook his head and sighed.
Zheng Yi continued, “As for you, what are your chances of winning against Wang Xuanhu?”
“Less than 10%!”


                    



Final Assessment
It was early in the morning. It was also the tenth day since Mo Xiu arrived at the Cosmic Tuition Class.
On the fourth day, after the group battle, Wang Lei set up the final test, which was to injure him.
This made the four of them very vexed. If they couldn’t even break through Wang Lei’s defenses, how could they injure him?
Over the past few days, Wang Lei and Wang Yu did not come up with any new tricks. They allowed the four of them to practice freely. Whenever they wanted to challenge Wang Lei, they would fight him.
The four of them had fought with Wang Lei quite a few times, but the results were just as tragic. Every time, they were beaten until they could not fight back.
Over the last two days, the four of them behaved abnormally and no longer challenged Wang Lei. Instead, they started fighting on their own, which surprised Wang Lei.
There was something that made Mo Xiu feel strange over the past few days.
Zheng Yi sent a message five days ago saying that the school was spreading rumors about him, but Mo Xiu told Zheng Yi not to mind them.
Given Zheng Yi’s personality, he would definitely not let the matter rest. However, he had not received any news from him for the past few days.
Last night, Mo Xiu asked Zheng Yi whether anything happened at school.
Zheng Yi only replied with two words, “It’s nothing.”
Mo Xiu’s instincts told him that Zheng Yi would definitely be fine. If not, Zheng Yi would not have acted so abnormally. He might as well return after today’s assessment and see what happened then.
The assessment began at 9 am.
Other than Wang Lei and Wang Yu, there was another person Mo Xiu was familiar with.
It was Elder Tang.
Mo Xiu was still wondering why Elder Tang had not made any moves for the past few days. This time, he actually took the initiative to appear.
Unlike Mo Xiu, Mu Qingyi, Liu Ziyang, and Yue Yuan all looked very serious when they saw Elder Tang appear.
Elder Tang sat down and said, “Don’t worry about me. I’m just here to take a look. You guys just have to perform normally.”
The last time Mu Qingyi had introduced Elder Tang, she had stopped mid-sentence. He must have participated in a great battle. Thus, it seemed like Elder Tang’s identity was not ordinary.
Wang Lei walked to the center of the arena and said, “Kids, whether or not you can become a Shadow depends on your performance this time.”
The four of them entered the arena. Then, Mo Xiu stood at the front and said, “Can we begin?”
Wang Lei spread out his hands and said, “The rules are the same as before. I will only use one skill. If you injure me, you win. Let’s begin.”
Mo Xiu activated Descent of the Martial God. Then, three rays of light rose from beneath his feet. The three metal arrays stacked on top of Mo Xiu’s body. As a result, his attack power was rather impressive.
Wang Lei narrowed his eyes. He obviously did not expect Yue Yuan’s skill to be used in such a way. He had stacked arrays to increase Mo Xiu’s attack power.
If that was the case, with Mo Xiu’s current attack power, a full-power strike should be able to injure him.
Wang Lei no longer stood still like before. Instead, he took the initiative to attack Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu used Baguazhang. Although it was only a basic martial art technique, it had relatively fewer weaknesses and was quite invasive.
As for Wang Lei’s moves, they didn’t involve any actual moves. Instead, it was a typical military style of fighting. Every move was aimed at Mo Xiu’s weak point. Furthermore, he simplified his movements as much as possible without any unnecessary movements.
Even if Mo Xiu had an attack boost, he would still be at a disadvantage after two moves.
At this moment, Mu Qingyi started to throw flying daggers to disturb Wang Lei. Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang wandered around, looking for an opportunity to attack Wang Lei from time to time. As for Yue Yuan, he took the opportunity to set up another array.
This was a tactic that they used frequently before, so they were very familiar with it.
Wang Lei said, “It’s still the same. How boring. Can you come up with something new?”
Seeing that they still had the same routine, Wang Lei gradually relaxed. He wanted to play with them for a while. Then, when he was done playing with them, he would deal with them together.
Just as Wang Lei was relaxing, he suddenly realized that Mo Xiu’s attacking style had changed. It was no longer Baguazhang. Instead, every move was firm and unyielding. Why did it seem like…
“Good boy. Are you using me for practice?”
Wang Lei finally reacted. Wasn’t the move Mo Xiu used his own attack?
He had actually learned his opponent’s techniques at such a critical moment to become stronger. Even an expert of Wang Lei’s level felt a chill in his heart.
Wang Lei immediately changed his mind. He didn’t want to drag this on any longer and wanted to end the battle as soon as possible.
Mo Xiu was too much of a variable. He wasn’t a threat now, but it didn’t mean that he would think of a move to injure him in the next second.
Wang Lei began to attack ferociously, and Mo Xiu immediately felt the pressure multiply.
“Liu Ziyang, help me!”
When Liu Ziyang heard this, he immediately charged forward. He held his dagger and attacked Wang Lei a few times.
However, Wang Lei wanted to get rid of Mo Xiu. Liu Ziyang couldn’t break through his defense anyway, so Wang Lei simply ignored him.
As a result, the battle became a battle between Wang Lei and Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu struggled to hold on, while Liu Ziyang chased after Wang Lei but to no avail.
Suddenly, Mo Xiu staggered and was punched by Wang Lei. After taking a step back, Mo Xiu actually punched Liu Ziyang.
Wang Lei thought that Mo Xiu had gone mad. He had even beaten up the members of his own team. He didn’t care about anything else and continued to attack.
However, Liu Ziyang’s Afterimage was triggered by Mo Xiu’s attack. In the next second, he appeared behind Wang Lei.
Two golden lights flashed, and two metal arrays were activated on Liu Ziyang.
At this moment, Wang Lei realized that he had been tricked. Mo Xiu had purposely hit Liu Ziyang just now. This way, he could trigger Liu Ziyang’s Afterimage. Previously, when he staggered, he had probably sent a signal to Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang.
During the battle a few days ago, Wang Lei also knew that Liu Ziyang’s first attack after activating Afterimage would result in a critical hit. Now, with the support of the metal array, his attack power could not be underestimated.
He wanted to turn around and defend himself, but he was held back by Mo Xiu. Wang Lei understood that this was their killer move.
It had to be said that the older one was, the more experience they would have. Wang Lei did not turn around. Instead, he swung his right leg backwards with all his might.
Although he did not kick Liu Ziyang away, he had also used most of his strength. Liu Ziyang’s dagger did not cause any damage.
Seeing that he didn’t succeed, Mo Xiu let go of him. Meanwhile, Wang Lei turned around and kicked Liu Ziyang far away.
Right at this time, Mu Qingyi, who no one noticed, threw out three flying daggers.
Two of the flying daggers moved in midair and appeared in front of Wang Lei, completely blocking his line of sight. Thus, Wang Lei could only take a step back.
The last flying dagger flew towards Mo Xiu, who caught it.
Since Wang Lei took a step back, this gave Mo Xiu enough space to exert force.
All his attributes had been increased by 100%. The increase in speed could increase his attack power. Meanwhile, the increase in his toughness and endurance could increase the amount of force exerted. As for the increase in defense, it could allow him to use their full strength without any worries.
The strength that emerged from his feet on the ground reached his waist. Then, the strength in his waist reached his arms.
“Shua!!!”
Mo Xiu attacked with the dagger.
Blood dripped from Wang Lei’s arm.
They had succeeded!
Together, the four of them made the impossible possible.
“We’ve succeeded!!!”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan hugged each other to celebrate. Mu Qingyi also started to spin around excitedly.
Elder Tang and Wang Yu sighed as well. These four people had improved so much in these ten days.
Meanwhile, Wang Lei retracted his armor and started clapping.
“You little guys are pretty impressive. Everything that happened before was fake. You were all hiding this final move.”
“Everyone has improved. Yue Yuan used five metal arrays to increase Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang’s attack power. Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang used Mo Xiu’s attack to activate Afterimage and almost injured me.”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were grinning from ear to ear.
“Mu Qingyi had the two flying daggers move at the same time to block my line of sight. She used her skill for this. Lastly, Mo Xiu was too steady.”
Everyone looked at Mo Xiu because everyone knew that Mo Xiu was the greatest contributor.
However, Mo Xiu stood rooted to the spot, as if he hadn’t moved since Wang Lei was injured.
Actually, Mo Xiu had been in a state of shock the entire time. What shocked him wasn’t Wang Lei.
Instead, just as he used his understanding of Descent of the Martial God to injure Wang Lei with all his power, a golden light flashed in his mind.
His skill had been upgraded…


                    



Skill Upgrade
His skill had been upgraded.
“Skill: God’s Eye 2.”
“Skill Effect: Can check all the skills of two targets.”
“Cooldown: 20 minutes.”
While Mo Xiu was sighing at the power of his skill, he also had doubts. He had a deeper understanding of Descent of the Martial God, so why did God’s Eye upgrade?
Mo Xiu hurriedly turned around and used his skills on Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang. He did not use it on Wang Lei and Wang Yu. This was still out of caution.
After the skill was released, it became Descent of the Martial God. When Mo Xiu saw the skill introduction, he was stunned.
“Skill: Descent of the Martial God 2.”
“Skill Effect: Increases all attributes by 300%.”
“Duration: 10 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 1 hour.”
Both skills had been upgraded, and it was a huge upgrade.
Mo Xiu was stunned for a long time and couldn’t control himself. His skills had been upgraded through training. However, why was it that when his understanding of a skill increased, both skills upgraded?
Mo Xiu looked at the dim skill pattern of his passive skill, Flip. Could it be because these two skills occupied the same skill position?
Wasn’t this so-called passive skill too powerful?
“Mo Xiu! Mo Xiu!”
Mo Xiu returned to his senses and saw Mu Qingyi patting his shoulder.
“Mo Xiu, what’s wrong?”
Mo Xiu said in embarrassment, “I was too excited and lost focus. I’m sorry.”
Then, he said to Wang Lei, “Teacher, have we passed?”
Wang Lei said, “You passed, you passed. You guys are really something to be able to injure me in a fight.”
It was unknown when Elder Tang had left, but Wang Yu was the only one sitting in the chairs.
Then, Wang Yu stood up and said, “Alright, you’ve passed. Take a rest and have lunch. I’ll tell you about joining the Shadow organization in the afternoon.”
Mo Xiu didn’t return to his room. Instead, he went to an empty spot outside the courtyard by himself.
Compared to joining the Shadow organization, the upgrade of his skills made Mo Xiu even more excited.
After all, strengthening oneself was the foundation of everything.
Mo Xiu released his skill, eager to test the power of Descent of the Martial God.
When the 300% increase in attributes took effect on Mo Xiu’s body, he finally understood why this skill was called Descent of the Martial God.
At this moment, Mo Xiu felt like he was a martial god. His entire body was filled with power.
With a punch, the sound of rushing wind could be heard.
If the current Mo Xiu were to fight Wang Lei, who had only used one skill, he might not win, but it would be no problem for him to injure Wang Lei.
Suddenly, a black shadow appeared. This black shadow gave Mo Xiu a very dangerous feeling.
Without another word, Mo Xiu threw a punch. It was as if this punch had landed on a piece of cotton. A sense of powerlessness was produced before a surge of energy surged over, forcing Mo Xiu to take several steps back.
“Not bad. I knew you were acting weird just now. It turns out that your skill has been upgraded, and the degree of this upgrade is not small. The skill should have increased all of your attributes by 300%, right?”
Mo Xiu looked over. This person was Elder Tang, who had just disappeared.
Mo Xiu immediately put up his guard. He still didn’t know if Elder Tang was a friend or a foe.
Elder Tang laughed out loud. “Don’t worry, you don’t have the strength to make me take action yet.”
Mo Xiu said, “Elder Tang, I’m very grateful for the opportunity to come to the Cosmic Tuition Class, but…”
“But you don’t know what my motive is, do you?”
Mo Xiu nodded.
Elder Tang continued, “When you’re old, you have to find some fun. Otherwise, it’ll be too boring. My interest is to understand everyone who enters the library, and this interest has continued for many years.”
“Then can you understand me?”
“No. You’re special and have a lot of secrets. However, I’ve changed my mind now. I’m not going to understand you anymore.”
Mo Xiu was alarmed again. What did he mean? Was he trying to silence him?
“Hahaha, I want to take you in as my disciple. How about it?”
“Take me in as your disciple? Is there anything special about me?”
“The starting point and growth rate of your skill is very strong. When Wang Yu taught you about the theories, there was something that he didn’t mention.”
“What was it?”
“Skills are relatively fair. Usually, the easier it is to upgrade a skill, the smaller the increase in the skill after upgrading. This means that the skill has a low growth rate. Meanwhile, if it is difficult to upgrade a skill, there will usually be a large increase after the skill is upgraded.”
Mo Xiu understood what Elder Tang meant. Descent of the Martial God was very strong at the beginning and had a high growth rate.
“I understand.”
“Furthermore, the starting point and the growth rate of your skill are not bad. More importantly, you are very similar to me when I was young.”
Elder Tang spoke casually, but his heart was in turmoil.
Putting aside whether Mo Xiu had a second skill, just this skill alone was enough to make Elder Tang want to take him in as a disciple.
His Level-1 skill increased all of his attributes by 100%. This was already very scary. When his skill increased to Level-2, it actually increased all of his attributes by 300%.
One had to know that Wang Lei’s skill, Inferno Armor, could only increase his attack power by 500% and increase his defense by 300% at Level-4.
Mo Xiu’s Level-2 skill was almost comparable to Wang Lei’s Level-4 skill. What kind of concept was that? It could no longer be described as a genius. He was practically a monster.
Mo Xiu said, “In that case, what benefits do I get if you accept me as your disciple?”
Elder Tang widened his eyes and said, “Rascal, I’m taking you in as my disciple, and you’re asking me for benefits?”
Mo Xiu spread his hands and said, “You were the one who looked for me and wanted to take me as your disciple. I’m not the one who wanted to take you as my master. Even if you want to take me as your master, there should still be a welcome gift.”
Elder Tang was furious. He threw a box on the ground and left.
“Brat, I’ve already prepared the gift. I’ll contact you later.”
Actually, Mo Xiu wasn’t asking for a gift. He was testing Elder Tang to see how true his words were.
From Elder Tang’s reaction, it seemed like he really meant no harm.
Mo Xiu picked up the box and opened it to find a black dagger inside.
He took it out and played with it for a moment. He discovered that apart from being unusually sharp, there was nothing special about it.
This time, Mo Xiu didn’t understand. Although he didn’t know Elder Tang’s true identity, he was still a big shot.
His skills were suitable for heavy weapons or long weapons like swords and sabers. It was impossible for Elder Tang to not notice this. Why did he give him a dagger?
Mo Xiu could not understand what was going on. He kept the dagger and returned to the courtyard.
Mu Qingyi, Liu Ziyang, and Yue Yuan were at the door.
Liu Ziyang saw Mo Xiu and immediately said, “Aiya, Mo Xiu, where did you go? We were looking for you.”
Mo Xiu was puzzled. “Why were you looking for me? It’s not class time yet.”
Mu Qingyi laughed lightly and said, “We’re looking for you to have lunch together. Let’s have a farewell meal!”
They went to the canteen and sat down.
Mo Xiu said, “Since we’re about to split up, let’s find a way to contact each other. Also, where are you guys going to university?”
The few of them were not weak. They could probably choose from a wide range of schools.
Liu Ziyang said, “I’m going to Yanjing University. Boss Mo Xiu, aren’t you going there too? Take care of me when the time comes.”
Mo Xiu smiled. “Do you need me to take care of you?”
Yue Yuan said, “I should be staying in Shun City. Although Shun City’s university might be a little lacking, my family is here. I have to stay.”
They nodded and looked at Mu Qingyi.
“I might go to Beijing or the northern part of the Alliance.”
The northern part of the Alliance was too far away from Shun City and Beijing. Only then did Mo Xiu understand why Mu Qingyi had said she would go to a far place.


                    



Shadow
In Shun City First High School, in the classroom of Year 3 Class 1…
Zheng Yi sat in his seat with a frown.
If Mo Xiu was here right now, he would definitely be shocked. After all, Zheng Yi had never been in such a state before.
The past few days had been tough for Zheng Yi. Although his right hand had been treated with medicine, he still felt a slight pain.
The duel between Liu Qingyu and Wang Xuanhu was very exciting, but Liu Qingyu still lost in the end.
Wang Xuanhu had also suffered a little in that battle. These days, he had vented almost all his resentment on Zheng Yi.
He continuously provoked and challenged Zheng Yi.
Zheng Yi calmed down a little after getting injured. He did not want to affect his college entrance examination results because of a moment of pique.
Even though he had been called trash and a coward, he had endured it until now.
Zheng Yi leaned back in his chair and sighed. “Ah, Mo Xiu, do you know how tough it has been for me while you were away?”
Although he said this, Zheng Yi was stubborn deep down. He didn’t want Mo Xiu to know about his current situation. He didn’t want Mo Xiu to destroy his original plan for him.
Ye Qian’er also suffered. After all, not many people believed Ye Qian’er’s words.
The source of her news, Zheng Yi, had been bullied by Wang Xuanhu. Thus, the students were also mocking Ye Qian’er.
…
At the courtyard of the Cosmic Tuition Class…
In the classroom.
Wang Yu wrote a word on the blackboard.
The word was “Shadow”.
“Do you know who the Shadows are?”
“The Shadows make up a department of the Alliance that eliminates internal strife. They specialize in punishing people who use their skills to cause harm to society.”
“You might ask, isn’t that the mission of the law-enforcement team? Then let me ask you, if anyone in the law-enforcement team breaks the law, who will punish them?”
Only then did Mo Xiu realize that the Shadows had such a responsibility. He had always thought that Shadows was the most free department.
“The Shadows belong to the Alliance but are relatively free. Unless the Alliance is in danger, the members can choose not to carry out any missions.”
“I’ll tell you what to take note of next.”
“One, the Shadow’s only external symbol is this medal. Your name and number are engraved on the back of the medal. I suggest you carry it with you.”
Wang Yu held a shiny black medal in his hand.
“Secondly, the Shadow’s name might be misleading, but I have to tell you that Shadows are not a secret organization. You can reveal your identity and fight for your rights.”
“Thirdly, there is a hierarchical system among the Shadows. The Shadows are ranked from Level-1 to Level-10. When carrying out the same mission, the low-leveled Shadows will have to listen to the commands of the high-level Shadows.”
“Fourthly, you will download a software. You can accept missions using the software. You will receive cash and points as rewards after completing missions. You can increase your level by accumulating points.”
“That’s all. You can take your time to understand the rest. The medal production will take some time. Meanwhile, you can download the software to your phones. When the medal production is complete, someone will contact you.”
“I almost forgot the most important thing. The management of Shadows is relatively free, but there is a bottom line. If someone causes harm to society or uses their identity as a Shadow to commit crimes, someone will punish them.”
The four of them downloaded the software.
The software was strange. There was no option of creating an account.
There was only a line of words and an input bar.
“Please fill in your personal information.”
Mo Xiu entered his personal information as requested and accessed the software.
The software was simple. There were only two large panels, one for the mission and one for his profile.
Mo Xiu opened his profile and read what was written on it.
“Name: Mo Xiu.”
“Level: 1.”
“Current Points: 0.”
“Remaining Cash: 0.”
After looking through the software, Mo Xiu realized that there was actually nothing. The purpose of this software was to accept missions.
In the evening, the four of them packed their luggage and prepared to leave.
When they walked out of the courtyard, everyone had a car to pick them up.
Gao Quan was waiting for Mo Xiu. Then, the four of them parted after a simple farewell.
Mu Qingyi smiled and said to Mo Xiu, “See you at the college entrance examination.”
After Mo Xiu got into the car, Gao Quan asked, “How is it? Is it done?”
Mo Xiu nodded and said, “Yes, I passed the test. Didn’t you know?”
“How would I know? I’m not a member of the Shadows.”
Along the way, Mo Xiu asked Gao Quan many times if anything had happened at school. Gao Quan did not respond.
The more this was the case, the more uneasy Mo Xiu felt. What could have happened at school?
Tomorrow was a school holiday, and the day after tomorrow was the day of the college entrance examination. Even if something were to happen, he would not know, so he could only ask Zheng Yi.
The journey home was always long. After some time, Mo Xiu reached home.
The moment he entered, he saw his mother busying herself at the table. Mo Xiu had sent a message in advance, so Li Yuan had prepared a table full of dishes.
However, Mo Xiu didn’t come back after a long time, so the dishes were reheated over and over again.
The moment Mo Xiu opened the door, Li Yuan took Mo Xiu’s luggage and welcomed him in.
“Xiao Xiu, how did you do outside?”
Mo Xiu grabbed the luggage and said, “Pretty good. I’ve learned a lot.”
“That’s good, that’s good!”
Mo Xiu sighed. His mother had always been like this. She didn’t ask too many questions and silently gave her all.
After dinner, Mo Xiu returned to his room to lie down and sent a message to Zheng Yi.
“I’m back. Shall we meet tomorrow?”
After a long while, Zheng Yi replied.
“I’m going to train in seclusion to prepare for the college entrance examination.”
Mo Xiu did not reply. If there was anything, they would talk when they meet.
Actually, this message was sent after careful consideration by Zheng Yi, even though it was unlikely that the word ‘deliberate’ would apply to Zheng Yi.
Zheng Yi did not want to affect Mo Xiu’s college entrance examination, so he said that.
The next day, Mo Xiu did not undergo any training and spent the entire day trying to relax.
He helped his mother with the chores and went out to buy groceries. When he came back, he clumsily cooked a meal.
After dinner, her mother commented on Mo Xiu’s food.
“This child is worth teaching!”
Mo Xiu didn’t know if what he did was good or bad.
After dinner, Mo Xiu lay on the bed and browsed through the Shadow software.
“Grade-D investigation mission. Investigate the mysterious factory. Reward: 100 points and 50,000 yuan.”
“Grade-C annihilation mission. Annihilate the group of Black Foxes. Reward: 1,500 points and 800,000 yuan.”
“Grade-B capture mission. Capture a fugitive. Reward: 5,000 points and three million yuan.”
…
“Grade-SSS bounty mission. Obtain the Black Dragon Eye. Reward: 10 million points and 10 billion yuan.”
Previously, he didn’t take a closer look at the missions. However, when he took a closer look, there were minor missions that involved finding items, and major missions that involved killing Beast Emperors. There were all kinds of missions.
The rewards were also very generous. Mo Xiu decided to take on some missions after the college entrance examination.
On one hand, it was to supplement the family’s income so that his mother would not have to work overtime every day for a meager salary.
On the other hand, he needed to save up some money to buy herbs. Mo Xiu had heard that university was different from high school. It was useless to just work hard. Only with sufficient resources could one successfully grow.
Mo Xiu had no connections or money to enter the university. He could only use his identity as a Shadow to obtain resources.
Although he had a cheap master, he didn’t even know where his master was now. He didn’t even have a way to contact him, so he had to rely on himself for everything.
When Mo Xiu thought about his cheap master Edler Tang, Mo Xiu took out the black dagger.
At first, he played with it in his hand, but later, he started to punch with the dagger. He found it quite convenient to use it.
“That old man is really stingy. He said he would give me a gift, but in the end, he gave me a weapon that doesn’t suit me.”
“Bang!!!”
Mo Xiu stared at the shattered glass and the black dagger outside the window, speechless.
The dagger had extended!!!


                    



College Entrance Examination (1)
Early in the morning, it was the day of the college entrance examination. Mo Xiu woke up early to pack up.
He had originally wanted to sleep yesterday, but he later discovered that the black dagger could actually be extended. In the end, he studied it until very late before sleeping.
After Mo Xiu’s research, he discovered that the black dagger was extremely magical.
As long as he held the handle tightly, it would extend. The greater the force, the longer the dagger would be.
Yesterday, it was precisely because he was careless that he exerted force on the handle and allowed the dagger to pierce through the glass.
Mo Xiu packed up his things and left.
He wanted to ask Zheng Yi to leave with him, but he did not reply to his messages. Furthermore, he did not see Zheng Yi at school.
However, he saw Mu Qingyi at the school gate. She was currently surrounded by a group of people.
She seemed to be in a difficult position as she looked around. When she saw Mo Xiu, it was as if she had seen her savior. She squeezed through the crowd and ran towards Mo Xiu.
Everyone was stunned when they saw that it was Mo Xiu.
Wasn’t Mo Xiu crippled? How could he still take the college entrance examination?
The group of people who were originally enthusiastic towards Mu Qingyi all moved far away.
Firstly, they had heard that Mo Xiu had offended an important figure and didn’t want to have anything to do with Mo Xiu to avoid implicating himself.
Furthermore, Wang Xuanhu could be said to be at the peak of his career at school.
During this period of time, everyone related to Mo Xiu had been dealt with by Wang Xuanhu. Thus, no one dared to talk to Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu saw that everyone was looking at him strangely and asked Mu Qingyi softly.
“Qingyi, what is going on?”
The relationship between the two of them had advanced by leaps and bounds in the Cosmic Tuition Class. Although they did not have any romantic feelings towards each other, they had already reached the stage where they knew each other well. Therefore, Mu Qingyi did not find it strange for Mo Xiu to ask her that.
“I don’t know either. I was surrounded by these people the moment I arrived at school. They kept asking me where I had been during this period of time, and why I came back for the college entrance examination?”
Then, Mo Xiu thought of the rumors about him that Zheng Yi had told him about. Perhaps these people believed those rumors and didn’t dare to interact with him.
The two of them went separate ways after entering the school building. Mo Xiu was in the third examination hall while Mu Qingyi was in the seventh examination hall.
The college entrance examination only lasted for a day, and was split into the morning and afternoon session. The written examination and the physical examination were in the morning, while the skill examination was in the afternoon.
An hour or so after the exam, the results would be out.
After that, the major schools would pick people based on their scores and high school records.
About three days later, the students would be informed that they had been accepted by the schools. They would then select the schools that they wanted to go to.
Firstly, the written examination tested the theoretical knowledge in the textbooks. It was the simplest of the subjects, and with a little effort, one would not score too badly.
The perfect score was 200 points. In normal mock exams, there were countless people who could score full marks.
Mo Xiu also finished this examination relatively easily. The first few multiple-choice questions and cloze questions were all basic questions.
The only difficult question was the last short-answer question.
After being taught by Wang Yu in the Cosmic Tuition Class, Mo Xiu had no problems answering.
Now, Mo Xiu’s understanding of skills was much higher than most people.
He finished answering the questions in less than an hour. The rest of the time was spent checking and handing in the papers.
After leaving the examination hall, Mo Xiu took out his phone and sent a message to Zheng Yi.
“Where did you go? Why didn’t I see you? Reply me once you see this message.”
After waiting for a long time, it was almost time for the next exam. However, Zheng Yi did not reply.
Mo Xiu could only go to the training grounds for the physical examination.
The physical examination was divided into three categories: the strength test, the speed test, and an actual combat test. Skills could not be used.
The total score was 400 points. The strength test and speed test were out of 150 points each. Meanwhile, the actual combat test had a total score of 100.
This was because high school students didn’t have much actual combat experience. Furthermore, they could slowly improve after entering university. Thus, the physical examination mainly tested their foundation.
At this moment, the training grounds were divided into fifty rooms. During the test, each room would have three teachers.
One was responsible for recording, one was responsible for supervising, and one was responsible for ensuring fairness.
Mo Xiu’s number was not at the front. Thus, he waited for a long time before entering the room.
“Mo Xiu, right? Put your hands above your head for inspection.”
The teacher in charge of fairness took two instruments and swept them over Mo Xiu.
One instrument checked if there were any foreign objects on his body, while the other instrument checked if there were any drugs that enhanced his body within the past 24 hours.
Before the college entrance examination, every form teacher would repeatedly emphasize that if the students wanted to use medicinal herbs to strengthen their body, they had to consume it early. Otherwise, they would not be able to pass the physical examination.
Even so, every year, many people would retire from the college entrance examination because they could not pass this check.
“You have passed the inspection. We can conduct the physical examination.”
Mo Xiu came to the strength testing area first. There was a huge sandbag that was fixed in place.
Taking a deep breath, he steadied his step. He gathered all his strength from the ground, consolidated it at his waist, and exerted more force in his upper body. Then, all the strength was consolidated in his arm, and finally his fist.
Bang!
A loud sound shook the three teachers. How could there be such a loud sound?
When they looked at the data, they saw that the power of his punch was 387.12 kilograms.
The three teachers were in disbelief. Was he even human?
After that, the three teachers unanimously believed that there was a problem with the instrument. They were unable to achieve such results, let alone a high school student. It was really unbelievable.
After checking that there were no problems with the instrument, the three teachers asked Mo Xiu to do another test.
The power of his punch was 388.01 kilograms.
It was even higher than last time. The strength test had a perfect score of 235 kilograms. Thus, this result was simply too shocking.
To ensure accuracy, the three teachers brought Mo Xiu to another room for another test.
The power of his punch was 388.75 kilograms.
The results were getting higher and higher. No matter how much the three teachers did not believe the results, they had to admit this fact.
This student named Mo Xiu was a monster.
Actually, Mo Xiu’s fist strength wasn’t that exaggerated. The reason why it had increased so much was because Mo Xiu had just understood how to maximize the strength of his fist.
After that, the speed test was conducted.
Mo Xiu ran 100 meters in 6.12 seconds.
Although it was not as exaggerated as his results in the strength test, it was still much better than the perfect score of 7 seconds.
The final combat test was a battle between students.
The doors of the two rooms opened, and a student walked into the room where Mo Xiu was being tested.
Mo Xiu didn’t know this person, but this person knew Mo Xiu.
This person’s name was Fang Jie. He was ordinary in school and did not have any outstanding qualities. At this moment, he was dejected because he did not perform well in the strength test.
When he saw Mo Xiu, his spirits were lifted. He had heard that Mo Xiu had already been crippled. This was equivalent to picking up a huge bargain.
The scores in the actual combat test were not determined by victory or defeat. Instead, the six teachers present would determine their scores at the same time. Then, the average score would be taken.
However, winning the battle would more or less give the victor some bonus points.
Fang Jie walked into the arena and said provocatively, “Come on, I know you. I’ll show mercy.”
The three teachers who came with Fang Jie were still alright, but the three who had just tested Mo Xiu were stunned.
How much did he drink? Where did his confidence come from? He knew who Mo Xiu was, yet this student still provoked him.
One of the teachers had just verified that Mo Xiu’s strength test results had broken the college entrance examination record.
Did this student want to show mercy against such a monster?
Even if Mo Xiu didn’t have any actual combat experience, just the pressure from his strength would be enough to kill Fang Jie.
Following Mo Xiu’s entrance, the teacher announced the start of the battle.
Fang Jie advanced quickly and launched a punch.
Mo Xiu took a step back unhurriedly. Then, he raised his right hand above his head and pressed down on Fang Jie’s head, exerting a little force.
Dong!
Fang Jie fell to the ground with his face on the ground. Mo Xiu turned around to look at the teacher, implying that he was wondering why the competition had not ended yet.
Several teachers went forward to check the situation.
Fang Jie’s mouth was agape and his eyes were blank. He had clearly lost consciousness.


                    



College Entrance Examination (2)
“Mo Xiu wins. The physical test has ended. Um… The examinees can leave now.”
When Mo Xiu walked out of the room, the six teachers were discussing.
After the exam in the morning, he still could not find Zheng Yi during lunch break, so he could only find a restaurant to eat at.
It was soon afternoon. The skill assessment in the afternoon could be said to be the most important part of the college entrance examination.
The total score was 400. This alone could show its importance.
Not only that, many universities would prioritize checking the scores of the skill assessment when they looked at the examination results.
Due to the importance of one’s score in the skill assessment, there would always be students with high scores who were not accepted by their ideal schools in the past years.
This was because both their written test and physical test scores were very high. Only the skill test was a burden.
The venue of the skill assessment was in the science and technology classroom. It was specially used for testing skills.
It was usually open, but students had to pay a fee to use the room. Furthermore, the price wasn’t something Mo Xiu could afford, so Mo Xiu had never entered the room.
Mo Xiu took the admission ticket and entered the science and technology classroom. Then, the staff led Mo Xiu into one of the rooms.
After observing the room, he realized that it was a sealed space with only one door, which was closed after entering.
Three of the walls were made of metal, while the last wall was made of glass. He could vaguely see two people sitting behind the glass.
Mo Xiu was about to take a closer look when he heard a voice.
The voice came from the loudspeaker on the roof of the room.
“Examinee, please wear the glasses and prepare for the exam.”
Mo Xiu looked around and saw a box in the corner.
When he opened the box and took a look, he found that it was more like a helmet than a pair of glasses. Mo Xiu took it out and put it on his head.
After putting it on, the helmet automatically locked and wrapped around Mo Xiu’s head.
The helmet didn’t affect his vision, and Mo Xiu could clearly see everything around him.
“Examinee, please raise your right hand. You will enter the assessment in three seconds.”
Mo Xiu followed the instructions and raised his right hand. Then, he heard the countdown.
“Three.”
“Two.”
“One.”
“The assessment begins.”
After the assessment began, the glass wall gradually disappeared and became an iron wall.
After that, two men in black appeared in the room. One of them had the word ‘friend’ written on it, while the other had the word ‘enemy’ written on it.
Mo Xiu immediately understood. One of them was his teammate, while the other was his enemy.
Without hesitation, he activated Descent of the Martial God to provide him with support.
When Mo Xiu reached the battleground between the two of them, the enemy suddenly injured his teammate with a punch and jumped back.
Mo Xiu reached out to pull his teammate up. However, when he touched his teammate, his teammate disappeared.
When he raised his head to look at the enemy, his enemy actually disappeared as well. Mo Xiu looked around but didn’t find any traces of the man in black.
Suddenly, the man in black appeared in front of Mo Xiu and punched him.
Mo Xiu immediately responded, but when he hit the man in black, it felt like he was hitting a steel plate.
No matter how Mo Xiu attacked, he could not defeat the man in black. As time passed, Mo Xiu realized that the strength of the man in black was increasing.
In the end, the black-clothed man’s strength increased to the point where Mo Xiu was unable to fight back. He threw a punch at Mo Xiu’s head.
“The assessment is over.”
Following the sound of the computer, the man in black disappeared and the glass wall appeared again.
Mo Xiu took off his helmet and put it back in the box, waiting for further instructions.
Mo Xiu roughly understood the mechanism of the skill assessment. In the beginning, when the two men in black fought, they wanted to test the candidate’s auxiliary skills. If they had an auxiliary skill, they could use it on their teammates.
After that, when his teammate was injured and fell to the ground, they were testing the healing skills of the examinees. One could treat their teammate if they had healing skills.
After that, the enemy disappeared. This was to test the detection skills of the examinees.
The final battle was to test the limits of their combat skills.
Mo Xiu did not hide his strength during the exam. Instead, he went all out to fight.
Hiding a secret was indeed very important, Mo Xiu felt that it was enough to hide God’s Eye.
If he had to hide the Descent of the Martial God, it would be too cowardly.
However, Mo Xiu was very curious if this detection system could detect God’s Eye.
After five minutes, the teacher said, “The assessment is over. Please leave.”
Mo Xiu walked out of the science and technology classroom and strolled around the field alone.
“Mo Xiu, you’re here!”
Mo Xiu saw that it was Mu Qingyi and walked over with a smile.
“Yes, yes. I just finished the exam and I’m waiting for the results. How did you do?”
Mu Qingyi said, “Not bad. What about you? There shouldn’t be any problems, right?”
“I didn’t face any problems. Everything is going smoothly. By the way, which school are you going to?”
Mu Qingyi said hesitantly, “Actually… I’m going to the Federal Academy.”
Mo Xiu was a little surprised. The three major colleges in the Alliance were Yanjing University, the Federal Academy, and the Academy of Faith.
These three schools corresponded to the three pre-war powers.
Although humans belonged to the Alliance now, they would not be able to get into the Federal Academy by taking the college entrance examination in Shun City.
Firstly, it was because of the distance. Furthermore, the living habits of both regions were somewhat different.
“Was it arranged by your family?”
Mu Qingyi had long said that everything was arranged by her parents, and she had no right to make any decisions.
Mu Qingyi nodded lightly and said, “Yes, we might not meet again in the future.”
“You can’t decide everything for yourself, but I can decide mine. I’ll look for you in the future.”
“Really?”
“Really.”
…
An hour later, the results were announced. Everyone’s results were posted on the field’s noticeboard and sent to their phones.
When Mo Xiu received the message, he immediately went home. This was because his score was 1,000.
He had obtained full marks. As far as Mo Xiu knew, in all these years of college entrance examinations, less than ten people had obtained full marks.
If he stayed at school, he might be pestered by the reporters, so he could only go home.
“First place: Mo Xiu. Results: 1,000 points.”
“Second place: Mu Qingyi. Results: 981 points.”
“Third place: Liu Qingyu. Results: 923 points.”
“Fourth place: Zheng Yi. Results: 901 points.”
“Fifth place: Wang Xuanhu. Result: 898 points.”
After seeing the rankings, Wang Xuanhu was the most furious. He originally thought that he would definitely win first place in Shuncheng High School.
Putting aside the fact that Liu Qingyu and Zheng Yi were ahead of him, Mo Xiu actually scored full marks.
Now, Wang Xuanhu only had one thought. Mo Xiu had cheated. He had to find Mo Xiu and make him reveal his true colors.
Meanwhile, Ye Qian’er, who was in a daze at home, received more than ten messages in a row.
Ye Qian’er was a little confused. Ever since she insisted that nothing had happened to Mo Xiu, she had been ostracized. Why would so many people suddenly contact her?
After reading the messages, Ye Qian’er hurriedly put on her clothes and ran to school.
This was because those messages were from her classmates. They were apologizing to Ye Qian’er.
Most of the messages said, “Qian’er, I’ve wrongly accused you. I didn’t mean to badmouth Senior Mo. Can you put in a good word for me and introduce me to him?”
Some other messages said, “Mo Xiu is too fierce. From now on, Mo Xiu will be my idol.”
When Ye Qian’er arrived at the field, she almost cried when she saw the ranking.
It wasn’t because Mo Xiu did well, but because it proved that Mo Xiu was fine.
For so many days, no matter how bad the rumors were, Mo Xiu did not respond. Even Zheng Yi had gotten in trouble.
Ye Qian’er thought that something had really happened to Mo Xiu.
However, it now seemed that Mo Xiu was fine. That was great.


                    



So That’s The Case
The next morning, Mo Xiu got up to look for Zheng Yi.
The moment he stepped out, a group of reporters surrounded him.
“Mo Xiu, as the top scholar of the college entrance examination, what do you have to say?”
Someone squeezed up from behind and said, “What kind of standards are those? You’re a new reporter, right? Mo Xiu, you scored full marks this time. Many people are questioning whether you cheated or not.”
“Mo Xiu, there are people speculating that you are from a prestigious family. Why are you staying here?”
Mo Xiu shut the door without a word, not wanting to listen to the chatter from the reporters.
Outside the door, people kept saying, “Mo Xiu, even if you’re the top scholar of the college entrance examination, you can’t be so rude.”
“Yeah, you’re so arrogant. I’m going to write an article to condemn you.”
Annoyed, Mo Xiu jumped out of his room window.
After Mo Xiu returned home yesterday, he had a simple celebration with his mother before going to bed.
He did not know that news of him getting full marks had spread like wildfire.
After a night of fermenting, too many people were alarmed.
In just one night, the principals of the various colleges, the higher-ups of the various powers, and this group of reporters had investigated all of Mo Xiu’s information. A student who scored full marks was actually living in a dilapidated neighborhood.
This allowed the reporters to unleash their imaginations and make all sorts of conjectures. Hence, they came early in the morning to stop Mo Xiu.
After Mo Xiu jumped out, he immediately called Zheng Yi, but no one picked up.
…
At the training grounds of Shun City First High School…
The training grounds, which should have been empty during the holidays, was now packed with people.
This was because there was an important match today. It was the second battle between Zheng Yi and Wang Xuanhu.
This battle was arranged by Wang Xuanhu because Zheng Yi was ranked ahead of him in the college entrance examination.
Zheng Yi agreed immediately. Actually, even if Wang Xuanhu did not look for him, he would look for Wang Xuanhu.
Zheng Yi was never one to swallow his pride. Previously, he had no choice but to endure for the sake of the college entrance examination.
After the college entrance examination ended, Zheng Yi could no longer tolerate it and wanted to settle scores with Wang Xuanhu immediately.
Hence, for the past few days, Mo Xiu had been looking for Zheng Yi, but Zheng Yi had not replied.
He only wanted to tell Mo Xiu what had happened after he had settled everything with Wang Xuanhu.
Wang Xuanhu said, “I really didn’t expect that a good-for-nothing like you would dare to agree to my challenge after hiding from me for so many days.”
Zheng Yi pursed his lips and said, “The reason for your challenge this time is probably because you didn’t do well in the college entrance examination, right?”
“You… If you hadn’t cheated, I would have been first.”
Zheng Yi laughed out loud. “How interesting. Are you saying that the four people in front of you cheated? You really dare to say that. Who can cheat during the college entrance examination?”
Wang Xuanhu was a little embarrassed. He had gotten fifth place this time partly because he did not expect Zheng Yi and Liu Qingyu to perform so well, and partly because of Mu Qingyi and Mo Xiu’s sudden return.
In addition, after Wang Xuanhu’s strength increased greatly, he became a little arrogant, causing him to neglect his training and revision. As a result, a lot of points were deducted from the written test and the physical test.
He had thought that victory was within his grasp, and that he would be able to brag about it everywhere he went. Now that he had been slapped in the face, how could he not feel hatred?
“You loser, I’m going to beat you up today. As for Mo Xiu, after I beat you up, he will be next. Don’t think that no one will suspect that he cheated and scored full marks. If I expose him, I will be a hero.”
Zheng Yi said, “Pfft, you aren’t even fit to carry Mo Xiu’s shoes. What hero are you? Don’t think I don’t know how your skill leveled up?”
Wang Xuanhu said indifferently, “So what if you know? If you have the ability, why don’t you upgrade your skill too? Don’t talk so much nonsense. I’ll definitely cripple you today.”
Zheng Yi became serious. Regardless, Wang Xuanhu’s strength was still above Zheng Yi’s.
The two of them entered the arena and got into a fight.
The entire audience held their breaths in silence.
“So that’s the case!!!”
A voice cut through the silence. It was not loud, but everyone could hear the anger in it.
The crowd opened up a path and a figure slowly walked over.
It was a figure that was very familiar to the two of them — Mo Xiu.
Zheng Yi first shouted, “Mo Xiu, this is my duel with him. It has nothing to do with you.”
Then, Mo Xiu said expressionlessly, “Do you think it’s very nice of you to take over everything?”
“Mo Xiu, I…”
Mo Xiu waved his hand and said, “Everything started because of me. I’ll settle it. Leave it to me.”
Zheng Yi wanted to continue, but in the end, he did not.
Meanwhile, Wang Xuanhu said disdainfully, “Stop acting like you’re brothers. It doesn’t matter who comes. Mo Xiu, you came at the right time. Today, I’ll let you know what true talent is. A piece of trash like you will have your reputation ruined from today onwards.”
Mo Xiu walked towards Wang Xuanhu step by step.
He spoke as he walked. His voice was neither loud nor soft, but every word he said was powerful.
“Some people don’t feel pain as long as they’re not beaten to death. Don’t you agree? Wang Xuanhu!”
Wang Xuanhu felt that his idea of victory was shaken at this moment.
Mo Xiu didn’t roar loudly. One couldn’t even tell what his emotions were, but he gave off a very strong sense of oppression.
“Cut the crap and start.”
Mo Xiu said, “Come at me!!!”
Then, he activated God’s Eye.
“Skill: Thorns 2.”
“Skill Effect: Spikes will be produced all over the body (The spikes can be fired. The strength of the shot depends on the base strength of the user). Increases defense by 150%, and increases strength and speed by 100% respectively.”
“Duration: 3 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 15 minutes.”
Mo Xiu had to admit that Zheng Yi’s loss to Wang Xuanhu made sense. After all, Wang Xuanhu’s skill was relatively strong.
Wang Xuanhu attacked Mo Xiu.
Then, Mo Xiu made a surprising move. He did not fight or use his skills. Instead, he took off his shirt.
His strong muscles were exposed, causing many girls to scream.
Meanwhile, Wang Xuanhu said angrily, “You’re still acting a pretentious prick!”
With a flash of golden light, Mo Xiu activated Descent of the Martial God.
“Today, I’ll show you the difference between us.”
Wang Xuanhu threw a punch at Mo Xiu. There were spikes on his fist, but Mo Xiu unexpectedly did not dodge.
Instead, a fist met Wang Xuanhu’s fist head-on.
Wang Xuanhu was forced back two steps. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu only had a small wound on his fist.
“How… How could your skill be so strong? Weren’t you crippled?”
After the first move, Wang Xuanhu knew that he was no match for Mo Xiu.
Wang Xuanhu still remembered Mo Xiu’s superb Baguazhang in the previous competition.
Wang Xuanhu knew that his chances of winning were slim when his skill did not provide him with an advantage.
Mo Xiu did not speak and walked straight to Wang Xuanhu.
“Even if your skill is strong, my defense is not something you can defeat. At the worst, I’ll defeat you… Ah!”
Before he could finish speaking, Mo Xiu punched Wang Xuanhu’s face again. Wang Xuanhu staggered and almost fell to the ground.
“Damn you…”
Bang!
“I…”
Bang!
“Mo Xiu!!! I…”
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Mo Xiu did not use any moves and just punched Wang Xuanhu.
Every punch was firm and without reservation.
Along the way, Wang Xuanhu tried to retaliate, but it eventually was futile under Mo Xiu’s relentless punches.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu’s punches were faster and faster. He struck Wang Xuanhu with pure strength, as if he was venting his emotions.
Meanwhile, Wang Xuanhu was standing at the beginning. Then, he sat down, before he lay down. He achieved all three forms of being beaten up.
Only then did the crowd understand why Mo Xiu had taken off his clothes.
This was because Mo Xiu was afraid of dirtying his clothes…


                    



Have You Vented Your Anger?
“Mo Xiu…”
Bang! Bang! Bang!
“I…”
Bang! Bang! Bang!
“Admit… Admit…”
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Wang Xuanhu wanted to admit defeat. However, at this moment, Mo Xiu’s eyes were red from fighting. He did not give Wang Xuanhu a chance to speak.
This battle could no longer be called a battle. Instead, it was a one-sided beating.
In the end, Mo Xiu’s fist stopped because Wang Xuanhu had lost consciousness.
Then, Mo Xiu stepped on Wang Xuanhu’s hand.
“Ah!!!”
Wang Xuanhu woke up from the pain and looked at Mo Xiu in horror.
“Mo Xiu, I was wrong. Stop hitting me. You’re not trash, I’m trash, alright?”
Mo Xiu squatted down and whispered into Wang Xuanhu’s ear, “There won’t be a next time, got it?”
Wang Xuanhu immediately replied, “I know, I know. I won’t provoke you again… Ah! Mo Xiu!”
Mo Xiu punched him again and shattered Wang Xuanhu’s right arm.
Wang Hu could no longer shout as he simply fainted.
Meanwhile, a commotion broke out in the crowd outside the arena. Mo Xiu usually appeared rather amiable. Thus, they didn’t expect him to be so ruthless.
Then, Mo Xiu stood up and walked towards Zheng Yi. “Have you vented your anger?”
Zheng Yi looked at Mo Xiu silently.
Mo Xiu turned around and was about to return to Wang Xuanhu and deliver a few more punches when Zheng Yi grabbed Mo Xiu.
“Enough, Mo Xiu. If you continue, he will die.”
Mo Xiu turned around and asked Zheng Yi the same question.
“Let me ask you, have you vented your anger?”
Zheng Yi returned to his normal self and said, “Barely. I originally wanted to humiliate him, but after I thought about it. Forget it. There’s no need to lower myself to the level of a dog.”
Zheng Yi did not say it out loud, but he was extremely touched.
The first time Wang Xuanhu attacked Mo Xiu, Mo Xiu calmly taught him a lesson.
However, he was clearly enraged this time. From the first sentence he said after arriving here, to every punch he threw at Wang Xuanhu, one could clearly see Mo Xiu’s anger.
Zheng Yi knew that Mo Xiu was doing all this for him. He was touched, but there was no need to say it out loud.
As for Mo Xiu, how could he not be moved? After all, Zheng Yi had been bearing too much responsibility these past few days. He didn’t even want to tell Mo Xiu about this.
The two of them looked at each other for a long time before laughing out loud.
“Hahaha, hahaha.”
The two of them laughed and left. The crowd was stunned when they saw the commotion.
What was going on? Mo Xiu had been extremely ferocious a moment ago, but now he was laughing and leaving?
Zheng Yi laughed out loud to express his grievances for the past few days.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu was laughing from the bottom of his heart. In the three years of high school, he had not only obtained strength, but also a trustworthy brother.
The two of them ignored the gazes of others and left just like that.
Then, they arrived at a small restaurant and started chatting as if they hadn’t seen each other for a long time.
“Mo Xiu, where did you go? You’re definitely not an exchange student, right? Did you go for special training somewhere? You scored full marks for the entrance examination too.”
Mo Xiu said, “I can’t tell you where I went. I promised others that I would keep it a secret. It can also be said to be a form of special training, and I improved a lot. As for you, sigh. It’s been hard on you.”
Zheng Yi shook his head and said, “Let’s not talk about it. This is the only time in my life that I’ve been vexed. I’ll treat it as an experience. Oh right, I originally wanted to settle this matter myself. Anyway, how did someone who has such poor news sources like you know that I was there?”
“It was Mu Qingyi who told me everything.”
When Zheng Yi heard Mo Xiu mention Mu Qingyi, his expression became strange.
“The two of you disappeared together. Have you won her over? How impressive. You’ve done all the awesome things in the world.”
Mo Xiu said, “Don’t speak nonsense. There is nothing between Qingyi and me.”
“Hahaha, you even called her Qingyi. Are you sure that there’s nothing? Do you think that I am a fool?”
“Aiya…”
Mo Xiu decided not to explain.
Then, Zheng Yi suddenly became serious. “When it comes to women, I have to mention someone.”
“Who is it?”
“It’s Ye Qian’er. When she heard the rumors about you, she came to look for me. I told her that you were fine. After that, she went back and stopped the rumors. At that time, she also suffered a lot of disdain from others.”
Mo Xiu turned around and said, “Got it. I’ll thank her when I have the chance.”
Zheng Yi added, “There’s also Liu Qingyu. If not for him, I might have lost half my life. One day, I’ll treat him to a meal. You have to come…”
While the two were eating and chatting, the news of Mo Xiu beating up Wang Xuanhu spread.
News regarding Mo Xiu appeared on various websites. Some said that this incident proved that Mo Xiu’s college entrance examination results were real. Meanwhile, others said that not only was Mo Xiu arrogant and rude, but even beat up his classmate.
However, no matter what news it was, in less than half a day, all the news regarding Mo Xiu were taken down.
No one knew the reason. Even the higher-ups of the various websites did not talk about it.
In the Shun City Shadow Headquarters…
Two people were discussing intensely in the office.
“Wang Yu, it’s not good to block news regarding Mo Xiu on such a large scale. He has endured hardships for so many years and finally made a name for himself. Can’t he show off?”
Wang Yu adjusted his glasses and said, “Brother, did you forget what Elder Tang told you?”
Wang Lei thought for a moment and said, “He told us to remember to keep Mo Xiu’s secret.”
“That’s right. We don’t have to care if Mo Xiu leaves Shun City, but he’s in Shun City now. If anything happens, we won’t be able to bear the consequences.”
“But…”
“No but’s. You were the one who nurtured Mo Xiu. Don’t you know his personality? Would he care about such a trivial reputation?”
Wang Lei sighed and said, “That’s true. I just feel that this child has a tough life and should enjoy everything that he has worked hard for.”
Wang Yu said angrily, “Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been able to achieve great things. Your vision is too narrow… Hey, don’t beat me up.”
…
At night, Mo Xiu scrolled through the Shadow software in his room.
He wanted to see if there were any suitable missions to take on. After all, Mo Xiu didn’t want to waste this holiday.
There were only 15 days of vacation after the college entrance examination. Thus, Mo Xiu wanted to use this time to accumulate more wealth.
Pa!
The glass window that had just been replaced was shattered. Mo Xiu immediately got down to check. Who had provoked this window?
However, when he saw what was thrown in from outside, Mo Xiu no longer had any intention of feeling sorry for the window.
It was a shiny black medal. Wasn’t this the Shadow medal?
Mo Xiu picked it up. Then, he saw that there was indeed a name and number engraved on the back.
“Mo Xiu, 13267.”
Now that he had a medal, it would be easier for him to accept missions.
Wang Yu said that the medal was the only symbol of the Shadows. With the medal, it would be easier to carry out missions.
Mo Xiu looked for a plank to block the window.
As he did so, he mumbled, “Must the Shadows use this kind of entrance? Why can’t they just use the main entrance? Do they have to knock on the window?”
Mo Xiu lay back on the bed and continued reading through the missions.
After searching for a long time, he finally found a suitable mission. The location was in Shun City, the difficulty was suitable, and the rewards were generous.
“Investigation Mission: Underground Arena.”
“Difficulty Level: C.”
“Mission Details: Recently, an underground arena appeared in Shun City. They have been using illegal means to organize gambling and gain benefits. The mission objective is to find out who the mastermind is.”
“Reward: 2,000 points, and 800,000 yuan.”
Mo Xiu sent a message.
“Shall we take on a mission?”
Liu Ziyang said, “No problem, Boss.”
Yue Yuan replied, “Okay.”
After a long time…
Mu Qingyi replied, “Okay.”


                    



Underground Arena
In a small park in Shun City.
The four of them sat side by side on a bench.
Mo Xiu said, “This is a mission that I’m preparing to accept. What do you guys think? If it’s possible, we can take on this mission together. I think that multiple people can complete it.”
Mu Qingyi and Liu Ziyang both expressed that they had no problem with the mission after reading it.
However, Yue Yuan frowned and said, “My family has some influence in Shun City, so I’ve heard of this arena. The law enforcement team has gone through many encirclements and suppression, but the success rate is very low. Even if they succeed, they will continue holding gambling sessions the next day.”
Mo Xiu said, “Yue Yuan, just say what you want to say.”
Yue Yuan looked at Mo Xiu and said, “The organizer is definitely not simple. He might have some foundation in Shun City and even planted spies in the law enforcement team.”
Mu Qingyi interrupted, “Is it very troublesome?”
Yue Yuan said, “It’s a little troublesome. If I’m not wrong, the difficulty of this mission should not be just Rank-C. The person behind the arena must be extremely careful.”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “I’ve thought of that too, but I’ve seen almost all the missions in Shun City and this is the most suitable one. This mission is indeed quite difficult, but what if we fight our way into the arena?”
Yue Yuan said, “Tell me more.”
Mo Xiu pointed at himself and said, “Do you guys think I look like I engage in illegal boxing?”
Liu Ziyang widened his eyes and said, “Boss, stop fooling around. You’re the top scholar of the college entrance examination. Although there’s no news of you now, who can’t find out about this?”
Meanwhile, Yue Yuan’s eyes lit up as he said, “Interesting. You’re the top scorer in the college entrance examination, but you’re from a poor family. You didn’t expose yourself for no reason after the college entrance examination and couldn’t benefit from the news. Thus, the possibility of you being suspected is very small. This plan is very interesting.”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “That’s right.”
Mu Qingyi objected, “I don’t agree. This is too dangerous.”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan looked at Mu Qingyi strangely. Was she feeling sorry for Mo Xiu? How many experts engaged in illegal boxing? After all, experts had their ways of making money. With Mo Xiu’s strength, he would definitely have no problems fitting in.
Mu Qingyi said angrily, “You’ve misunderstood what I said. I’m saying that Mo Xiu won’t be suspected, but we will be. When the time comes, only Mo Xiu will be able to infiltrate the arena, while the three of us can only provide support. If we’re discovered to be spies, it’ll be too dangerous.”
Only after Mu Qingyi said this did they react. That was right! It was indeed very dangerous for Mo Xiu to enter the enemy’s territory alone.
Mo Xiu said, “We can give it a try. I will give you guys an order based on the information I have.”
The three of them thought about how calm and mature Mo Xiu was. They felt that if they accepted this mission, this was the only way to succeed.
Mo Xiu looked at them and said seriously, “How is it? Is it decided?”
“Okay!” Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan agreed immediately.
Mu Qingyi also agreed unwillingly.
Mo Xiu said to Yue Yuan, “Yue Yuan, your family is a local tyrant. Can you help me find a contact?”
“A contact?”
“Yes, we just need to get in touch with the middle and lower levels of the arena. We have to make sure that they don’t get suspicious.”
Yue Yuan pondered for a moment before saying, “No problem, I’ll get it done right away.”
Yue Yuan was an impatient person. After receiving the order, he immediately went to do it.
Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang pointed at himself and said, “Boss, what can I do?”
Mo Xiu thought about it and said, “You can contact the law enforcement team.”
Liu Ziyang asked, “The law enforcement team? What exactly should I do?”
Mo Xiu said, “Go to the law enforcement team and find two to three people who are relatively reliable. Tell them that they are currently on a mission and need their cooperation. Don’t tell them what exaclty we are doing and maintain communication with them. Once I have any news, inform them immediately.”
Liu Ziyang thought for a while and gave him a thumbs up. “Boss, you’re really something!”
Initially, Liu Ziyang wanted to chat for a while more, but when he saw Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi exchanging glances, he instantly understood.
“Boss, I’ll do it now. I’ll let you know when I’m ready.”
Before he left, he gave Mo Xiu a knowing look.
Then, only Mu Qingyi and Mo Xiu were left. Mu Qingyi smiled at Mo Xiu.
“What about my mission?”
Mo Xiu said, “I thought you wouldn’t come this time. Why did your family agree to let you do your own thing?”
Mu Qingyi glanced at the direction Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang had left in.
“It’s because of the two of them. My father said that the two of them were worth befriending. That’s why he let me go out.”
“Oh? Then can I ask you out in their name?”
“Huh?”
Mu Qingyi did not expect Mo Xiu to suddenly speak so explicitly and was slightly flustered.
“Stop fooling around. Let’s be serious. Did you not assign me a mission because you thought that I wouldn’t come?”
“Haha, on the contrary, your mission is the most important.”
Mu Qingyi asked doubtfully, “What’s my mission?”
“Help me, and… protect me!”
…
That afternoon, Mo Xiu came to a bar. As it was still early, there were not many people in the bar.
Mo Xiu ordered a lot of wine and drank alone.
“Young man, why are you drinking so much in broad daylight?”
Mo Xiu looked up. It was a man in his thirties. He walked to his table and sat down.
“Who are you? I don’t need you to care.”
The man didn’t get angry. Instead, he smiled and said, “I’m the boss of this shop. Everyone calls me Hei Zi. If there’s anything you don’t like, just tell me. It’ll be better if you tell me.”
Mo Xiu said shakily, “Let me tell you, I’m the top scholar of this year’s college entrance examination. However, I offended someone and the news was blocked. I should be earning money every day, but there’s nothing now. How f*cking unlucky!”
When Hei Zi heard Mo Xiu’s words, he immediately perked up and whispered, “Are you really the top scorer of the college entrance examination?”
Mo Xiu rolled his eyes and said, “Go away, go away. If you don’t believe me, why are you still talking to me?”
Hei Zi immediately pulled Mo Xiu and said, “Hey, brother, I don’t mean anything else. I just feel that the top scholar is too amazing. I have a job that can allow you to earn money. Are you willing to do it?”
Mo Xiu said casually, “What job is it? I won’t do it if you don’t offer me enough money!”
“Hey, be quiet. It will definitely provide a lot of money, so much that you can’t imagine the amount.”
Mo Xiu asked suspiciously, “What job is it? How much can I earn? I’ll be leaving Shun City after school starts.”
Hei Zi looked around and whispered, “It’s illegal boxing. With just one holiday, you can probably earn millions.”
Mo Xiu’s eyes lit up, but he didn’t say anything.
Hei Zi continued, “Don’t worry, we’re very good at keeping it a secret. It won’t be known by your university. You can consider it first. If you want to do it, come here tonight at 9.30 pm.”
Mo Xiu stood up and said, “Alright. Give me the bill!”
Hei Zi hurriedly refused and said, “Hey, Little Brother, you’re treating me like an outsider. I’ll treat you today, and you can come again next time.”
Mo Xiu staggered out of the bar and hailed a cab.
The moment he entered the cab, he took out his phone and sent Yue Yuan a message.
“Everything went smoothly!”
In reality, Hei Zi was Yue Yuan’s contact. Yue Yuan had spoken to him beforehand.
Everything that happened just now was a show that the two of them put on together, just in case.
After all, the boss behind the arena had eyes everywhere. Thus, they could not leave anything suspicious behind.
At this moment, Liu Ziyang also sent a message: “Boss, the matter has been settled. We will follow the arrangements.”
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu had arranged for Liu Ziyang to contact the law enforcement team so that he would have a shield. Regardless of whether he was captured or failed the mission, he could ensure his safety.
Now that everything was arranged, they were just waiting for the big fish to take the bait.


                    



Bulldozer
Mo Xiu instructed a few people not to contact him and to wait for his news. The secret code was “ant”.
At nine in the evening, Mo Xiu came to the bar on time to find Hei Zi.
Hei Zi welcomed Mo Xiu warmly when he saw Mo Xiu.
“Dude, I knew you’d be here. I asked around. Your name is Mo Xiu, right?”
Mo Xiu said, “That’s right. Where is the place you mentioned? Bring me there.”
The two of them didn’t say much. Hei Zi drove Mo Xiu to the city center and finally stopped in front of a high-end hotel.
Mo Xiu didn’t expect that they would choose this place as the location of the arena. It was no wonder that the law enforcement team always returned empty-handed.
Hei Zi brought Mo Xiu to the rooftop. The rooftop was very big, and loud noises could be heard when they came up.
There were cheers, music, and screams mixed together.
Mo Xiu followed Hei Zi to a room at the edge of the rooftop.
Mo Xiu said, “Hei Zi, didn’t you say you would bring me to a boxing match?”
“Yes, but the selection of contestants here is very strict. You need to meet the people who are managing the situation.”
Mo Xiu said disdainfully, “Why do I have to go for an interview? I’m leaving then.”
Hei Zi pulled Mo Xiu and said, “Brother, we’re already here. Let’s go in and take a look.”
When they entered the room, there was only one office table. There was a person sitting and another person standing there.
Hei Zi went up and said respectfully, “Boss Fang, I brought you a contestant. Can you take a look?”
Boss Fang glanced at Mo Xiu and said, “Hei Zi, are you kidding me? This is a student, right?”
“Hey, Boss Fang, he’s indeed a student, but he’s not a simple student. He’s the top scorer of this year’s college entrance examination.”
Boss Fang sized up Mo Xiu again. The top scorer of the college entrance examination was indeed a gimmick.
“You may leave. I’ll have a private chat with this young man.”
Hei Zi walked out of the room, leaving Mo Xiu standing alone.
Mo Xiu asked, “Why? Aren’t you going to invite me to sit down?”
Boss Fang smiled apologetically and said, “Haha, little brother, I’m sorry for neglecting you. Please take a seat!”
Then, he gave a signal to his subordinate, who nodded and left.
Boss Fang said, “What’s your name? Are you really the top scholar of the college entrance examination?”
Mo Xiu turned his head and didn’t look at Boss Fang. Instead, he placed one foot on the chair.
“Yes!”
“Hmm, then why do you want to engage in illegal boxing?”
Mo Xiu glanced at Boss Fang and said, “Rubbish. I want to earn money.”
Boss Fang asked again, “You’re the top scholar of the college entrance examination. Why can’t you earn money? Why are you here?”
Mo Xiu said impatiently, “Why are you so wishy-washy? I offended someone and can’t appear on the news. Without fame, I can’t earn money. Also, I like to beat people up. I like to beat people until they can’t fight back.”
Boss Fang looked at Mo Xiu as if he was an arrogant brat.
After a while, Boss Fang’s subordinate returned with a stack of documents.
Mo Xiu knew without looking that the documents contained his information.
Boss Fang flipped through the documents seriously and nodded from time to time.
Then, Mo Xiu said, “Boss Fang, are you going to tell me if I’ve been hired or not? Can I go to the arena and practice boxing now?”
Boss Fang sized up Mo Xiu once again and said, “Alright, Mo Xiu, you can come here to practice. Come here tomorrow at 9 pm. I’ll arrange a good opponent for you.”
Mo Xiu stood up and walked out. As he walked, he said, “How boring. I thought I could go to the arena today. See you tomorrow!”
After Mo Xiu walked out of the room, one of Boss Fang’s subordinates asked, “Boss, I don’t quite understand. The information clearly says that Mo Xiu is very hardworking and calm, but his performance just now was very suspicious.”
Boss Fang picked up the documents again and said, “If his performance was normal, I wouldn’t have allowed him to practice boxing. This is what I like more.”
“Why?”
“Sometimes, a small matter is enough to drive people crazy, such as when the hard work that they have put in for a long time was not rewarded, or when they think that they are finally going to make a name for themselves but were hit in the head. Mo Xiu is such a person.”
His subordinate frowned in confusion.
Boss Fang laughed and said, “You’re good at everything, but you’re not good at reading people. The information says that Mo Xiu has been working hard since he was young, and his results have always been outstanding. It means that he has always been working hard for the college entrance examination, but he hasn’t received any returns after the examination.”
“If you had worked hard for 18 years and suddenly relaxed after achieving your goal, but didn’t get anything in return, what would you do? From the way he beat up his classmates after the college entrance examination, you can tell that he has a suppressive and violent tendency in his heart. Such a person who has lost his mind is the easiest to control.”
The subordinate was enlightened. He raised his thumb and said, “Boss, that’s great. That’s really great.”
…
Mo Xiu didn’t go home after leaving the hotel. Instead, he found a nearby bar and played for the entire night.
This was because Mo Xiu knew that the arena would definitely investigate him in secret at this time. Thus, he couldn’t give himself away.
It was impossible for Boss Fang to be the mastermind. He might not even be able to see the actual boss, so he couldn’t rush things.
The next morning, Mo Xiu brought a woman with heavy makeup out of the bar and entered a hotel.
In reality, Mo Xiu pretended to sleep the moment they entered the room and only came out at night.
Boss Fang sat in his office and asked his subordinate, “What has Mo Xiu been doing all day today?”
His subordinate replied, “He had a drink at the bar last night and brought a girl back to a hotel in the morning. This has lasted until now. Boss, you are too godly. Mo Xiu is already dispirited.”
Boss Fang said proudly, “You should learn from this. I’ll arrange for Mo Xiu to fight with Bulldozer tonight!”
His subordinate said in surprise, “Boss, Bulldozer has already achieved ten consecutive victories. Shouldn’t Mo Xiu start fighting other newcomers first?”
“That’s the plan. Just wait for the show to start.”
At 11 pm, Mo Xiu sat backstage, preparing for his first illegal boxing match.
Mo Xiu had watched a few matches from backstage. The scene was very cruel. As long as one went on stage, there were no rules and any dirty tricks could be used.
Even if one party lost consciousness, the other party would not stop. The crueler the scene, the more excited the audience would be.
This went against Mo Xiu’s beliefs. Why was there such a place?
However, after thinking about it, it made sense. The martial artists here were generally very weak. When he compared them to the competitors outside, they were like heaven and earth.
They could only use cruel competition methods to attract the audience and attract a lot of attention. Then, they could start gambling and manipulate the outcome to gain benefits.
Boss Fang patted Mo Xiu and said, “Brother, don’t take a nap. Come, it’s time for you to go into the arena.”
Mo Xiu followed behind Boss Fang and was about to go into the arena.
The emcee’s passionate voice filled the entire competition venue.
“Everyone, the finale match is coming up. Everyone should have been looking forward to it for a long time.”
“The first to enter is the person who has achieved ten consecutive victories, the person who has knocked out his opponents ten times… Bulldozer!!!”
A burly man who was about two meters tall entered the arena. His mountain-like figure matched his nickname perfectly.
The audience erupted into cheers.
“Next up is our super rookie, the college entrance examination champion… Mo Xiu!”
When the audience heard this, they started discussing. Was the top scholar of the college entrance examination here to engage in illegal boxing?
When they saw Mo Xiu appear, Mo Xiu was booed.
The Bulldozer could kill this skinny guy with one punch.
Faced with the boos from the audience, Mo Xiu gave an evil smile and raised his hands above his head as he gave the audience a thumbs up in disdain.
The crowd boiled over at this gesture.
“F*ck, this kid is not big, but he has guts. I bet everything on Bulldozer!”


                    



Blood Fist Mo Xiu
Mo Xiu’s actions mocked the entire audience. The sound of cursing filled the air.
However, Boss Fang was secretly laughing. This Mo Xiu was truly a talent. He had easily stirred up the entire atmosphere.
The emcee spoke again.
“This super rookie is really arrogant. Let me see his true strength. Both sides, get into the arena!!!”
Mo Xiu and Bulldozer both came to the stage. Bulldozer beat his chest muscles with his fists to show his strength.
Mo Xiu said disdainfully, “You’re like a gorilla. Do you think you’re very handsome?”
When Bulldozer heard Mo Xiu’s words, he simply rushed over.
The emcee immediately stopped him. “Wait a minute, wait a minute. The competition hasn’t started yet. Bulldozer is still as brave as ever.”
The process of the competition was for both parties to enter the arena first to adjust their emotions. After that, they would look at each other to increase the number of highlights in the match before the competition began.
The emcee did not want Bulldozer to break the rules, but this was good too. After all, the audience’s mood was unprecedentedly high as a result.
“Go down, trash!”
“You don’t even know how you’re going to die later, and you’re still spouting nonsense.”
“In the past, I’ve seen quite a number of academic fighters, but most of them were never seen again after one match.”
“Aw, I like this kid. He’s arrogant enough.”
“If you have the strength, then you’re arrogant. If you don’t, then you’re courting death.”
As the audience was too loud, the emcee could only raise his voice and shout, “The next two contestants are looking at each other. The competition is about to begin.”
Mo Xiu and Bulldozer stood together and looked at each other. Bulldozer glared fiercely at Mo Xiu.
On the other hand, Mo Xiu raised his head and squinted his eyes as he looked lazily at Bulldozer.
Bulldozer grew even angrier at such contempt, and his expression gradually turned savage.
Actually, Mo Xiu wasn’t as relaxed as he appeared to be. He secretly read Bulldozer’s skill.
“First Skill: Rock.”
“Skill Effect: Increases weight by 30%.”
“Duration: 3 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
“Second Skill: Hardening.”
“Skill Effect: Hardens the user’s skill and increases the user’s defense by 20%.”
“Duration: 2 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
“Third Skill: Collision.”
“Skill Effect: When the user grabs the target and falls backwards, the user’s attack power will be increased by 20% in the process.”
“Cooldown: 30 minutes.”
“Fourth Skill: Iron Fist.”
“Skill Effect: The attack power of each punch is 150% of the user’s basic attributes.”
“Cooldown: 30 minutes.”
Bulldozer was obviously over 21 years old, so he had awakened all four skills.
Overall, they were all combat skills, but the strength of his skills was very average.
However, he would still use a sledgehammer to crack a nut in this situation.Mo Xiu didn’t want to fail miserably. After all, there were no rules here. As a newcomer, he couldn’t be careless.
“The competition begins!!!”
Mo Xiu instantly activated Descent of the Martial God. Then, he stood on the ground and spread his hands.
When Bulldozer saw that Mo Xiu was still so arrogant, two rays of light flashed from his body. Then, he released his first and second skills.
He used his right arm to protect his head as he squatted down slightly and walked forward step by step.
This was Bulldozer’s usual move. He used his unparalleled weight and defense to push his opponent into a corner.
After that, he would continue to squeeze his opponent, knock his opponent down with a few punches, or end the battle with a slam.
This fighting style was also the reason for his nickname of Bulldozer.
As his fighting style was simple and brutal, there was a large number of die-hard fans in the arena.
Just when the audience thought that Mo Xiu would be pushed into a corner like Bulldozer’s previous opponents, Mo Xiu’s actions shocked everyone.
Mo Xiu stretched out his right hand and placed it on Bulldozer’s right arm. Then, Bulldozer could no longer move forward.
The noisy crowd gradually quieted down as everyone watched this scene in disbelief.
The reason for this was because this scene was simply too bizarre.
An ordinary high school student had used one hand to block the hill-sized Bulldozer.
Meanwhile, Bulldozer looked like he was still struggling and was constantly exerting force.
Mo Xiu said, “Don’t waste your energy. You can’t push me. How can you call yourself a Bulldozer with such little strength?”
Bulldozer was quite powerful. If Mo Xiu didn’t use any skills, Bulldozer’s strength and weight should be enough to push Mo Xiu.
However, after Mo Xiu’s attributes were enhanced by his skills, it was different. Mo Xiu was already very strong. Furthermore, with the 300% increase in attributes from Descent of the Martial God, he was able to defeat Bulldozer, who was most proud of his strength.
At this moment, Bulldozer stopped in his tracks and looked at Mo Xiu in disbelief.
Then, he took a step back and activated his fourth skill, Iron Fist.
Mo Xiu raised his arms to protect his head. The five punches landed solidly on Mo Xiu’s arms.
The audience felt that Mo Xiu was being overconfident. It was one thing to be strong, but it was another to be able to withstand attacks.
At this moment, Mo Xiu didn’t choose to dodge. Instead, he took the hit head-on. Even if he wasn’t injured, he would be severely injured by the impact of the punch.
However, only the Bulldozer knew how scary Mo Xiu was. Mo Xiu didn’t move at all.
Then, Bulldozer lowered his fist and took a few steps back. He now knew that their strengths were not on the same level.
His killer move was unable to cause any damage to Mo Xiu. Thus, he already had thoughts of giving up.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu stood up straight and said, “Are you done? If you’re done, it’ll be my turn.”
Bulldozer opened his mouth, but no words came out.
Mo Xiu’s fighting style was very simple. It was the same as when he was fighting Wang Xuanhu. It was simple, brutal, and merciless.
However, Bulldozer did not have Wang Xuanhu’s defense. Thus, he fell to the ground after just one punch.
Mo Xiu didn’t stop. He went forward and punched him two more times. Then, he looked up at the emcee, who didn’t have any intention of stopping the competition.
Thus, Mo Xiu had no choice but to keep fighting. He punched faster, his fists raining down on Bulldozer.
The emcee originally thought that Mo Xiu would show off to the audience. Thus, the emcee planned to stop the competition after a few punches.
However, looking at Mo Xiu’s stance, it was obvious that he was going all out. Thus, the emcee immediately stopped the competition.
“Mo Xiu wins. Mo Xiu, please stop.”
When Mo Xiu heard the emcee’s voice, he continued punching twice before stopping. Then, he slowly stood up with an indifferent gaze.
At this moment, all the spectators noticed that Mo Xiu’s hands were blood-red. Wasn’t this too brutal?
In reality, Mo Xiu had held back. If he had used his full strength, Bulldozer would have died.
Mo Xiu didn’t interact with the audience and walked straight to the backstage.
Boss Fang’s attitude changed a lot. He said ingratiatingly, “Mo Xiu, you’re the best. Keep it up and conquer this place.”
Mo Xiu said nonchalantly, “How much can I get for this match?”
Boss Fang took out a few stacks of money and placed them in front of Mo Xiu. He said, “You are a newcomer, so you’ll get a little less money. This is a total of 30,000 yuan.”
Mo Xiu frowned. He could actually earn so much money from one match. Money came too quickly. It was no wonder so many people were willing to come here to practice.
Seeing Mo Xiu frown, Boss Fang thought that Mo Xiu was unhappy and immediately explained.
“Mo Xiu, don’t be anxious. You performed very well today. In the future, as long as you get more attention, it will be easy to earn money.”
Mo Xiu lowered his head and said, “Alright, I’ll believe you for now. If the benefits aren’t enough, I might not work with you anymore.”
Mo Xiu had already understood that Boss Fang wasn’t a high-leveled executive behind the scenes. He was just a manager who recruited fighters.
After this match, he became famous. Mo Xiu believed that many people would try to poach him.
Boss Fang smiled and said, “In that case, let’s not treat each other as outsiders. I’ve arranged a hotel for you. Go back and rest.”
Mo Xiu left, but the underground arena was in an uproar. A heavyweight fighter had appeared out of nowhere.
His nickname was… Blood Fist!


                    



Newcomer King Mo Xiu
The hotel that Boss Fang had arranged for them to stay at was the hotel where the arena was located. They could just take the elevator down.
Mo Xiu returned to his room and took a quick shower before lying back on the bed.
Then, he sent a message to Mu Qingyi, Yue Yuan, and Liu Ziyang.
“Ant, on the rooftop of Sky Treasure Hotel. Don’t act rashly.”
According to the plan, Mo Xiu sent them a message. Unless there was a problem, they didn’t need to reply.
However, Mo Xiu received a reply as soon as he sent the message.
“Did you have a good time at the hotel today?”
The message was sent by Mu Qingyi, so he understood immediately.
Mu Qingyi was probably referring to the fact that he had brought a woman to a hotel and did not come out for a day.
Mo Xiu smiled and shook his head before replying.
“I slept for the whole day. Why? Are you jealous?”
Mo Xiu did not explain himself. He only said that he had slept for the whole day.
After a while, Mu Qingyi replied, “Ant received!”
What Mo Xiu did not expect was that Mu Qingyi was currently looking at her phone and scolding Mo Xiu for being a hooligan.
Looking at the time, it was already past 11 pm. Just as Mo Xiu was preparing to sleep, the door rang.
Mo Xiu became alert. Who could it be at this hour?
When he opened the door, he saw two scantily clad women.
Mo Xiu frowned and asked, “Who are you?”
One of the older women said, “We were sent by Boss Fang to serve you. Do you want us to go in?”
Mo Xiu said coldly, “Go back and tell Boss Fang that what I want is money. Don’t mess this up.”
Bam! The door closed.
After the door closed, the younger woman asked, “Sis, how are we going to explain ourselves when we get back?”
“What else can we say? We can only tell Boss Fang the truth. He didn’t even let us talk much. If we knock on the door again, we might anger him. Let’s go!”
Mo Xiu returned to his bed again and carefully thought about what he could do to make use of Boss Fang, as well as what methods he could use to get closer to the higher-ups.
After pondering for a moment, Mo Xiu smiled and picked up the money Boss Fang had given him.
“It seems like I have to make a big deal out of this. Furthermore, I can also earn money. Why not do this?”
…
The next morning, Mo Xun wanted to go out for a walk but was stopped by Boss Fang’s subordinate.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Mo. You can’t go out.”
Mo Xiu ignored him and walked past him. This person stretched out his hand, wanting to stop Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu grabbed his hand and pushed him down.
A golden light flashed across the subordinate’s body. Clearly, he had activated a skill.
Mo Xiu had already learned the skills of this subordinate and Boss Fang during their first meeting.
Boss Fang had an auxiliary skill, while this person mostly had investigative skills and only one skill that increased his attack power. Thus, it was impossible for him to defeat Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu snorted and said, “Hmph! Do you want to try fighting with me? It just so happens that I have nothing better to do.”
With that said, Mo Xiu twisted his neck, looking like he was about to fight.
Just then, Boss Fang ran over.
“Nonsense, how can you be so rude to Mo Xiu? Get lost.”
His subordinate ran off without another word. Mo Xiu was a little disappointed to see him run off.
“Boss Fang, what do you mean? When I first arrived, you didn’t say that you wanted to restrict my freedom.”
Boss Fang immediately replied, “Mo Xiu, didn’t you perform too well yesterday? If you go out now, you’ll definitely be targeted.”
Mo Xiu said impatiently, “Boss Fang, do you think I’m an idiot? If something is the matter, just say it.”
Seeing that Mo Xiu wasn’t easy to fool, Boss Fang invited Mo Xiu to his room and started explaining.
“Mo Xiu, I’m actually just a small fry. I’m in charge of selecting the boxers. I’ve received orders that everyone under me cannot leave the hotel today. I have no choice.”
Mo Xiu said, “Then get someone above you to talk to me!”
Boss Fang said many comforting words to Mo Xiu and explained many things. Finally, Mo Xiu reluctantly returned to his room.
After this conversation, Mo Xiu also understood the management of the arena.
The classification of ranks was very clear. People like Hei Zi would select boxers and hand them over to a manager like Boss Fang. If a boxer could be hired, Hei Zi would get a commission.
Meanwhile, Boss Fang had to listen to his superior’s orders. His superior would tell him when competitions would be held, when the boxers could go out, and when they could not go out.
When a boxer reached a certain level of fame, they would be upgraded to the rank of a King Boxer.
The King Boxers were jointly managed by a higher level of the management, who arranged the so-called King’s War.
Regardless of whether it was the amount of attention paid to the King’s War or the amount of bets placed, it was not something that ordinary matches could compare to.
Mo Xiu suspected that Boss Fang was definitely not the boss behind the arena. However, once he came into contact with the boss, he would be closer to the truth.
…
That night, Boss Fang asked Mo Xiu if he had any objections to participating in two matches.
Mo Xiu replied, “I have no objections. It’s best if I fight every match. I’m here to earn money!”
The two opponents in this competition were not as strong as Bulldozer, and Mo Xiu easily won. Of course, there was also the beating after his victory and the scarlet fists that resulted after.
This time, he had finally established his reputation as Blood Fist. All the audience knew that there was a college entrance examination champion in the underground arena called Blood Fist.
On the third day, Mo Xiu fought against five contestants and won all of the matches!
On the fourth day, Mo Xiu fought against nine contestants and won all of the matches!
On the fifth day, Mo Xiu fought against seven contestants and won all of the matches!
Mo Xiu had won a total of 24 matches since his debut, and all of them had been great victories. No one had been able to hurt Mo Xiu at all.
Mo Xiu was naturally referred to as the Newcomer King by others. Due to his dazzling achievements, he was promoted to the rank of King Boxer.
Every King Boxer had to fight one battle after another, and they had to go through dozens of battles before they were able to advance. However, Mo Xiu only took five days.
Today was the sixth day since he had arrived here. Mo Xiu sighed. It was truly easy to lose oneself in the rapidly growing wealth and the cheers of the audience during the battle.
In just five days and 24 matches, Mo Xiu had earned 1.53 million yuan. This time, the mission reward was only 800,000 yuan. Furthermore, the reward would be shared among four people.
It was no wonder that the laws of the Alliance were so strict. There were always people who took the risk to do illegal things to profit.
The profits were simply too shocking. After all, Mo Xiu was only a boxer. The boss behind this arena would probably earn countless amounts of money every match.
Knock, knock, knock!
There was a knock on the door, and Mo Xiu knew that what was supposed to come had finally come.
When Mo Xiu opened the door, he saw Boss Fang say with a respectful expression. “Mo Xiu, congratulations on advancing to the rank of King Boxer. From now on, you’re no longer under my jurisdiction. It’s such a pity. When I worked with you. I…”
Mo Xiu angrily interrupted Boss Fang and said, “Alright, we’re already so close. Just tell me how much you earned!”
Boss Fang smiled and said, “Hahaha, I didn’t earn as much as you. Let’s go.”
Then, Boss Fang brought Mo Xiu to a room in the hotel.
Mo Xiu was a little puzzled. Could the entire organization be in this hotel?
Boss Fang said softly, “Mo Xiu, go in. I won’t go in. The person inside is called Xue Jin. He’s the person in charge of the entire arena.”
After knocking on the door a few times, the door opened. It was a middle-aged man in his forties.
Mo Xiu did not hold back after entering. He found a chair and sat down.
“Are you the person-in-charge here? How much can you pay me if you arrange a King’s War for me?”


                    



Xue Jin
The middle-aged man was not angered by Mo Xiu’s rudeness. Instead, he returned to the table and sat down before speaking.
“Let me introduce myself. My name is Xue Jin, and I am indeed the most powerful person here. As for how much money you can earn, it all depends on you.”
Mo Xiu frowned. “What do you mean? Speak clearly!”
Xue Jin replied, “After you become a King Boxer, you will become one of us. Without a fixed appearance fee, how much you can take depends on how much we earn.”
Mo Xiu lowered his head in silence.
Xue Jin laughed loudly. “Hahaha, don’t worry. As long as you are obedient, you will only earn more than before.”
“As long as I’m obedient? What does that mean?”
“I know that you are very strong. You can always win competitions in the early stages. However, we will arrange for you to lose a few matches occasionally. Do you understand?”
Mo Xiu stood up unhappily and turned to leave. As he walked, he said, “I won’t lose.”
After Mo Xiu left, Xue Jin leaned back in his chair.
He muttered to himself, “There’s no one I can’t control. No one can resist all of their desires!”
Before Mo Xiu had come, he had known that the underground arena would make profits through fake fights. He had left this time because he wanted Xue Jin to take the initiative to find him. This would allow him to obtain more useful information.
After returning to his room, Mo Xiu sent Xue Jin’s name and physical characteristics to Mu Qingyi and the others.
Half an hour later, Mo Xiu received a reply from Yue Yuan.
“Xue Jin is one of the more famous freelance investors in Shun City. He has many shares in many companies under his name and has 5% shares in Sky Treasure Hotel.”
After finding Hei Zi, Yue Yuan was also in charge of gathering intelligence. Occasionally, he would tell Mo Xiu about the latest information.
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but marvel at Yue Yuan’s efficiency. He had managed to find out everything within half an hour.
However, Mo Xiu found it a little strange. As the person in charge of the arena, Xue Jin actually revealed his real name to others. Wasn’t he afraid that the law enforcement team would find out?
While he was thinking, his phone rang. This time, it was Liu Ziyang.
“Boss, Xue Jin has been suspected of being related to the arena many times, but the law enforcement team has no evidence. In addition, Xue Jin’s prestige in Shun City is rather high, so the law enforcement team can’t detain him for long.”
Mo Xiu understood. This was a formidable person. There was nothing he could do even if the law enforcement team came.
Finally, Mu Qingyi sent a message.
“What should I do?”
Mo Xio thought for a moment and smiled strangely.
“Do me a favor. I have 1.53 million yuan here. You…”
Mo Xiu waited for a day. When it was finally close to night, he was told to go to Xue Jin’s room.
The moment Xue Jin’s door opened, Mo Xiu was stunned. It was unlike the time in the morning when Xue Jin was alone.
This time, there were seven or eight people working in the room, making the spacious room especially crowded.
Mo Xiu said casually, “Boss, I’m here. Why are you looking for me?”
Xue Jin tossed a document to Mo Xiu and said, “You have a King’s War scheduled for tonight. Go and prepare. This is the opponent’s information. You can win tonight.”
Mo Xiu threw the documents on the ground and said, “I don’t like people ordering me around. I can win if I want to and lose if I want to.”
Xue Jin did not raise his head. He was still busy with his work and handed Mo Xiu a piece of paper, saying, “This is the expected reward for winning tonight.”
When Xue Jin handed him the piece of paper, Mo Xiu activated God’s Eye.
“First Skill: Voice Transformation 2.”
“Skill Effect: Changes the user’s voice to a desired voice.”
“Second Skill: Reflex 2.”
“Skill Effect: The user cannot be recorded by any equipment.”
“Third Skill: Perception 2.”
“Skill Effect: The user can sense the detection-type skills that others use on you and lock onto their target.”
“Fourth Skill: Charge 2.”
“Skill Effect: Increases speed by 500%.”
“Duration: One minute.”
“Cooldown: One hour.”
Xue Jin seemed to have sensed something. He suddenly raised his head and looked around before looking at Mo Xiu in confusion.
“I still have things to do. You can go back first.”
Xue Jin could clearly sense that someone was investigating him, but he could not lock onto the other party. This was the first time such a situation had happened in so many years.
Mo Xiu suppressed the nervousness in his heart and said, “Alright, I want to keep winning.”
After saying that, he turned around and left. The moment he left, Mo Xiu took a deep breath.
This Xue Jin was simply a freak. Out of the four skills, he had three anti-detection skills that did not have a cooldown time, while the last skill was an escape skill.
He could change his voice and was not afraid of being recorded. Furthermore, others could not take photographs of him or investigate him. This way, it was no wonder that the law-enforcement team could not find any evidence. He was simply a natural lawbreaker.
Moreover, Xue Jin’s skills were all at Level-2. This was too abnormal. Mo Xiu wasn’t sure if he had been exposed.
Xue Jin’s third skills could allow him to lock onto the person investigating him, but looking at his reaction just now, it did not seem like he had discovered Mo Xiu.
After returning to his room, Mo Xiu decided to continue his mission.
Xue Jin did not seem to be faking it just now. He must have discovered someone investigating for some reason but could not lock onto the target.
It took a while for Mo Xiu to recall the piece of paper Xue Jin had given him. When he looked at it, Mo Xiu was frightened.
It listed the payment that Mo Xiu would receive tonight.
“Ticket shares: 80,000 yuan.”
“Expected tips: 350,000 yuan.”
“Estimated revenue from bets: One million yuan.”
The remuneration for a match was actually more than one million. This was too exaggerated.
While he was shocked, Mo Xiu also scolded the person who assigned the mission to the Shadows.
How did such a mission only have a reward of 800,000 yuan?
Mo Xiu calmed down and understood Xue Jin’s intentions. He wanted to use money to make Mo Xiu obedient.
There were a total of three sources of revenue on this piece of paper. Two of them were estimated, which meant that this piece of paper should have been given to the contestants after the competition.
However, the reason Xue Jin had given it to Mo Xiu was to tell Mo Xiu that the profits were large enough. If he was obedient, he would earn even more in the future.
Mo Xiu sent a message to Mu Qingyi and the other two, telling them to investigate Xue Jin properly.
It was very likely that Xue Jin was the boss behind this.
With the way he did things, the skill and ease he had shown while he was busy, his shares in the Sky Treasure Hotel, and his extremely powerful anti-detection skills, Xue Jin definitely had the ability to organize such an arena.
In that case, would he still need someone to rely on? Would he still have to risk his life for others?
When Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang received Mo Xiu’s message, they suggested that they inform the law enforcement team directly. Even if they didn’t have any evidence, they could at least arrest the culprit, right?
Mu Qingyi did not say anything and listened to Mo Xiu’s arrangements.
Mo Xiu decided to wait. He felt that this matter was too simple.
…
At 10 pm…
“Today’s finale is a King’s War. Sparta, whom everyone has been looking forward to, will be participating today. Sparta has not lost in two months and has only lost once in his career…”
In the arena, the emcee was introducing the battle results of a boxer nicknamed Sparta, who was warming up for a match as usual.
Mo Xiu sat backstage and did not see Xue Jin. Could it be that Xue Jin would not come to watch the competition?
“Who’s Sparta’s opponent? You should have guessed by now.”
Everyone shouted in unison, “Blood Fist! Blood Fist! Blood Fist!”
In fact, a promotion had been done before the tickets were sold. Thus, everyone knew about the battle tonight. The reason why the emcee said this was to stir up the audience’s emotions.
“That’s right, the other contestant today is the Newcomer King who has achieved 24 victories in five days… Blood Fist!!!”
Upon hearing the emcee call his name, Mo Xiu stood up and walked towards the stage.
Sparta was a middle-aged man in his forties or fifties. His body was strong, and all four skills increased his attributes.
Xue Jin had probably arranged this match because he felt that Sparta and Mo Xiu’s competition methods were similar. It would be a very interesting match.
“Both sides, look at each other!”


                    



Each Person Will Receive 20,000 Yuan
Mo Xiu continued to look at his opponent nonchalantly.
Sparta, who was standing opposite him, was not as angry as Bulldozer. Instead, he looked calmly at Mo Xiu.
This was different from Mo Xiu’s previous matches. This time, the audience was not one-sided. Instead, each side had their own supporters.
Mo Xiu had fewer supporters. This was probably why Xue Jin had let Mo Xiu win.
“The competition begins!!!”
“Ah!!!”
Sparta roared, and his body grew larger. It seemed that he had unleashed all his skills.
Meanwhile, a golden glow appeared on Mo Xiu’s body as he activated Descent of the Martial God.
Then, he rushed forward and threw a punch. Sparta was not to be outdone and also threw a punch.
The two fists collided. Sparta clutched his right hand and fell to his knees in pain.
He looked at Mo Xiu in disbelief and said, “Impossible, impossible! How can you be so strong?”
Mo Xiu frowned slightly. He hadn’t used his full strength in that punch just now. The two punches were evenly matched, so why was this person in so much pain?
Mo Xiu looked around the arena and saw Xue Jin at the center.
Xue Jin was smiling at him. So that was the case!
Mo Xiu had thought that the contestants in the King’s War would be stronger and more difficult to deal with.
However, from the looks of it now, the King’s War was simply a joke. It wasn’t a competition of strength but acting skills.
Mo Xiu didn’t have any interest in continuing the battle. He wanted to get off the stage and continue acting arrogant.
However, after thinking about it, he stopped. Mo Xiu raised his fists and beat Sparta like he did in the first 24 matches.
Just like that, the match that the audience had been looking forward to ended without any suspense.
After the competition ended, Mo Xiu returned to his room.
At midnight, Mo Xiu went to find Xue Jin to settle scores.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Mo Xiu knocked on the door as though he was venting his emotions.
Xue Jin opened the door and smiled. “Come in. I’m waiting for you.”
After entering the room, Mo Xiu realized that there was another person inside. It was a man in his fifties or sixties. What was he calculating? He didn’t notice Mo Xiu entering at all.
This man’s name was Zhang Siyuan, Xue Jin’s accountant.
Suddenly, Zhang Siyuan said, “Boss, the profits have been calculated.”
After handing a document to Xue Jin, Xue Jin casually placed it on the table.
Even though Xue Jin was very careful, Mo Xiu still saw that the profits were three million yuan.
Mo Xiu was the first to speak. “Boss Xue, you’re being a little too unreasonable. Why did you let my opponent go easy on me? Do you think I can’t beat him?”
Boss Xue threw Mo Xiu a card and said, “This is your reward. It’s a little more than what we planned.”
Mo Xiu asked, “How much is that?”
“You’ll get 1.8 million yuan!”
Mo Xiu was shocked, not because he had never seen money before.
It was because Xue Jin had given him 1.8 million yuan, but the profit was only three million yuan.
Mo Xiu would never believe that Xue Jin would give him half of his profits.
He would not be the only one in this competition. Sparta would also get a share.
If the profits Mo Xiu had just seen were real, then what did Xue Jin rely on to earn money?
Mo Xiu was thinking quickly, but in Xue Jin’s eyes, Mo Xiu was scared silly.
“What’s wrong, Mo Xiu? Don’t be agitated. This money is all yours. Go back to your room. I’ve prepared a gift for you.”
Mo Xiu nodded and walked back to his room in a daze.
The moment he entered, he saw two women lying on his bed.
Mo Xiu closed the door and smiled at the two women.
…
The next morning, two women sat in Xue Jin’s office. They were the two who had appeared in Mo Xiu’s room last night.
Xue Jin asked, “Are you telling me that Mo Xiu didn’t reject you yesterday? Tell me what he did yesterday. Be more detailed!”
The two girls chimed in, “This young man is really healthy. He carried us to the bed the moment he came in.”
“That’s right. He looks young but has a big appetite. He was definitely going to eat us both.”
“That’s right, that’s right. His health is really good.”
“His body is really good. Yesterday, he even…”
Xue Jin interrupted, “Alright, there’s no need to say anymore. You guys can leave!”
Xue Jin smiled and muttered to himself, “Mo Xiu is just a child. He should slowly lose himself in his desires!”
That night, Mo Xiu conducted another King’s War. As expected, it was arranged by Xue Jin, and Mo Xiu easily won.
Mo Xiu’s income was still 1.8 million yuan this time. However, the rewards and tickets shares had increased, while his revenue from bets had decreased.
When Mo Xiu returned to his room, there were two more beauties.
This time, Mo Xiu went straight to Xue Jin and caused a huge ruckus. He insisted on looking for the two women from the previous night. He even said that they were acquaintances and cooperated well.
Xue Jin did not know whether to laugh or cry. He could only find those two women and instruct them to stay by Mo Xiu’s side.
Mo Xiu’s actions made Xue Jin believe that Mo Xiu was easy to control.
Then, Mo Xiu brought the two women back to his room.
The moment Mo Xiu entered the room, he took out two stacks of cash and threw them on the table.
“We’ll follow the same old rules. Each person will receive 20,000 yuan. You can earn as long as I stay here.”
Upon hearing Mo Xiu’s words, the two girls immediately came over to take their share.
One of the women asked, “Brother Blood Fist, are you really not good in that aspect? You look so brave and fierce, but it doesn’t seem like it!”
Mo Xiu glared at the woman and said, “Don’t mention this again. This is my weakness. Don’t blame me for being impolite.”
Another woman chimed in, “We feel bad taking 20,000 yuan for free every day. Why don’t we help you shower?”
Mo Xiu laughed strangely. “Hehe, there’s no need. After I realized that I’m not good at that, I think I prefer men.”
The two women were shocked and stopped talking.
In reality, the night before, Mo Xiu had already told the two girls that he had some flaws in some aspects. They were not allowed to speak of this scandal.
If they helped Mo Xiu keep the secret, they would each receive 20,000 yuan.
At first, the two girls didn’t really believe it. However, Mo Xiu later told them that not only could they not say that he was no good to outsiders, they also had to say that he was very good.
The two girls immediately understood Mo Xiu’s thoughts and agreed immediately. That was why they had the conversation with Xue Jin.
…
It was the eighth day since Mo Xiu arrived.
It was still a great victory. This time, after Mo Xiu won, he didn’t immediately return backstage. Instead, he interacted with the audience and stirred up their emotions.
This was Xue Jin’s instructions. This was the first time Mo Xiu had been obedient.
That day, his income was 1.2 million. His ticket shares and tips were still increasing. However, his revenue from bets was zero, which meant that Xue Jin was already starting to lose money.
On the ninth day.
Mo Xiu was arranged to fight against Hades, who had the highest points among the King Boxers.
Mo Xiu had thought that Xue Jin would make him lose this round, but he did not expect that Xue Jin would order him to win.
Xue Jin had great plans. He wanted to make Mo Xiu an undefeated legend, and then make Mo Xiu lose another match. At that time, all the money he had lost would be returned, and he would make a fortune.
Mo Xiu won this match again, but it was not easy. Xue Jin had arranged for this match to last for half an hour.
Meanwhile, the audience witnessed the birth of the new king of the arena. It only took nine days.
Even so, Mo Xiu cooperated from beginning to end.
Xue Jin knew that Mo Xiu had already become his money-making tool and had no other thoughts.
He had earned 1.35 million yuan today, but the return from bets was still zero.
When Mo Xiu returned to his room, the two women were still in his room.
Mo Xiu secretly sent a message to Mu Qingyi and the other two.
“Ants, prepare to draw in your nets!”


                    



Drawing in the Net (1)
Today was the tenth day since Mo Xiu arrived at the arena.
Within ten days, Mo Xiu went from a student who had been booed in the arena, to the King of the underground arena that everyone knew.
He enjoyed the cheers in the arena every day and became the undefeated legend of the people… Blood Fist.
Early in the morning, Xue Jin called Mo Xiu over.
“Mo Xiu, how have you been these past few days?”
Mo Xiu said excitedly, “I’ve been great! I’ve never received so much money or enjoyed such a life.”
Xue Jin was very satisfied with Mo Xiu’s answer. “Not bad. However, the remuneration for the past few days has not increased. What do you think of this?”
Mo Xiu said nonchalantly, “It’s fine. I already have a lot of money. I just need to maintain the status quo.”
After hearing Mo Xiu’s words, Xue Jin said with a disappointed expression, “Mo Xiu, where’s your drive when you first came here? How can you be content with the current situation? Wouldn’t it be good to obtain more money to go to university?”
Mo Xiu spread out his hands and said, “I don’t lack anything now, so why do I still need to go to university? Isn’t the point of going to university just to live like this? I already have it!”
Xue Jin knew that Mo Xiu had completely fallen into his hands. He was content with the current situation and obeyed orders.
“Look at this!”
Mo Xiu took the document that Xue Jin handed to him and opened the first page. His expected rewards were written on it.
“Ticket revenue: 200,000 yuan.”
“Revenue from expected tips: 500,000 yuan.”
“Estimated revenue from bets: 10 million yuan.”
Mo Xiu suddenly looked up at Xue Jin, his eyes filled with disbelief.
“Boss Xue, what… What is happening here?”
Xue Jin stood up and patted Mo Xiu’s shoulder.
“If you want to lose tonight, you’ll get this amount of money, perhaps even more.”
Mo Xiu frowned and said, “But… But I just became the new king of the underground arena. This is when I…”
Xue Jin laughed loudly. Mo Xiu’s words at this moment meant that he no longer resisted losing the competition.
“Mo Xiu, after you lose this round, take the money and have fun outside for a few days. When you come back, I will arrange for your winning streak.”
Mo Xiu said reluctantly, “But what about my fans? If I lose, they won’t support me anymore.”
Xue Jin said meaningfully, “Do you think that the audience likes to see the king undefeated without a doubt, or do you think they prefer seeing the king coming back to destroy any doubts?”
A glint flashed across Mo Xiu’s eyes. After some thought, he said, “Alright, I’ll lose tonight. What’s the script like?”
“The document I gave you just now is followed by the script. Go back and prepare well.”
Mo Xiu nodded and left the room without another word.
Xue Jin leaned back in his chair and made a call.
“It’s ready.”
“Don’t worry, Mo Xiu is still under control. He’s just a student.”
Mo Xiu did not return to his room. Instead, he kept walking along the corridor. After a long time, he saw an acquaintance walk out of their room. Only then did he return to his own room.
Then, he sent a message to Yue Yuan.
“Ant, check the specific gambling methods of the underground arena.”
Ten minutes later.
“The gambling method is a little special. All audience members who enter the venue must use their real names and provide the arena with a bank account number. After entering the venue, the audience members can place their bets in the special software used in the arena. The results of the competition and the bet will be automatically settled by the software. After the competition ends, the first thing the arena needs to do is to transfer the winnings into the audience’s accounts via an anonymous account. The money will be transferred to the accounts in real time.”
Mo Xiu finally understood why very few people reported the arena to the authorities even though there were so many people in the audience. The reason was because of the system.
The arena transferred the winnings to the audience’s accounts in real time to restrict and fix their customer base. It was unknown who came up with this operation method.
Mo Xiu sent a message to Mu Qingyi, Yue Yuan, and Liu Ziyang.
“Ants, draw in the nets tonight. The plan is as follows…”
…
At the rooftop of the Sky Treasure Hotel.
“Tonight is the first battle after the new king of the arena has ascended to the throne. Do I need to introduce Blood Fist to everyone?”
Everyone cheered.
“No need!!!”
“Blood Fist! Blood Fist! Blood Fist!”
The emcee gestured for the audience to quiet down.
“Everyone, calm down. I have yet to introduce his opponent. Blood Fist’s opponent is a new King Boxer, Silver Warrior. He has unparalleled speed and can often win by surprise.”
The audience became noisy again.
“What the heck? Silver Warrior fought almost 200 matches before he advanced to become a King Boxer. There’s no competition at all.”
“I reckon Blood Fist will be done in one punch. There’s no suspense at all.”
“Blood Fist, I will bet everything on your victory.”
The emcee could not control the emotions of the audience and could only shout loudly.
“Let us welcome both parties into the arena. The first is Silver Warrior!”
The crowd booed even louder than the first time Mo Xiu went on stage. Silver Warrior practically walked up the stage with his head lowered.
“Next is the king, Blood Fist!”
The entire audience erupted into a sea of cheers.
Mo Xiu was in no hurry. He slowly walked towards the competition venue.
During this time, he made a lot of interactions with the audience. While walking to the arena, he took off his cloak and threw it at the spectators.
After arrogantly walking onto the stage, Mo Xiu leaned against the edge of the stage and greeted the audience, completely disregarding his opponent.
In the next segment where both sides looked at each other, Mo Xiu was even more aggressive. He walked forward as he watched and was warned many times by the emcee.
Meanwhile, Silver Warrior was a little timid and kept retreating, not daring to look at Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu shouted loudly, “Silver Warrior, was it? I think you should go down, lest you get seriously injured and can’t fight in the future.”
The mood in the venue was raised to the highest point. Then, the emcee gave the order for the competition to begin.
“Begin!”
…
At the same time, Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang sneaked into Sky Treasure Hotel.
“Old Yue, do you think Boss Mo Xiu’s plan will work? Isn’t it a little too hasty to draw in the net now?”
Yue Yuan said angrily, “If you want to leave, sure. You can be the boss. If not, follow the plan. How’s the law enforcement team doing?”
Liu Ziyang said smugly, “Boss has instructed me to contact the law enforcement team. I’ve been constantly testing these few days and finally found someone I can trust completely. Just watch carefully.”
Yue Yuan nodded. Although Liu Ziyang was usually cheerful, he was also an extremely serious person at crucial moments.
…
When the match began, Mo Xiu did not even activate his skill. He just quietly looked at Silver Warrior and made an inviting gesture.
Silver Warrior gritted his teeth and activated his skill to charge towards Mo Xiu.
At this moment, Mo Xiu used his skill and kicked Silver Warrior.
Silver Warrior was kicked and retreated to the edge of the field before stopping.
Then, he looked warily at Mo Xiu. Seeing that Mo Xiu did not make any further moves, Silver Warrior rushed forward again.
With a simple punch, Mo Xiu knocked Silver Warrior back again. After that, Silver Warrior rushed forward again.
This continued for more than ten times. Mo Xiu stood firmly on the spot, while Silver Warrior was sweating profusely from running back and forth.
Xue Jin, who was sitting in the front row, nodded. Mo Xiu had done well. Everything was going according to the script.
After a few more moves, Mo Xiu seemed to have lost interest in playing and took the initiative to attack.
However, since Silver Warrior was too fast, Mo Xiu couldn’t hit him.
After a few minutes of chasing, Mo Xiu forced Silver Warrior into a corner and punched him.
Below the stage, Xue Jin’s lips curled up slightly. According to the script, Silver Warrior should quickly move behind Mo Xiu and deal a critical hit. After that, the battle would turn around. Then, Mo Xiu would be defeated after being unable to resist.
Mo Xiu punched out and Silver Warrior disappeared before quickly appearing behind Mo Xiu.
Everyone thought that Mo Xiu would definitely be hit by this attack, including Xue Jin.
However, no one expected Mo Xiu to suddenly turn around and use his full strength with his right fist. Everyone present heard the sound of the wind breaking from this punch as it directly hit Silver Warrior on the back.


                    



Drawing in the Net (2)
Silver Warrior was directly hit to the ground as a deep pit appeared on the ground.
Xue Jin could no longer remain calm when he saw this. He slammed the table and stood up, staring at Mo Xiu in disbelief.
Mo Xiu also turned to look at Xue Jin with a smile on his face, appearing very polite.
Xue Jin shuddered when he saw Mo Xiu’s smile. What exactly was going on?
The emcee did not react to the sudden end of the competition. After a short moment of shock, he immediately announced the results.
“The Blood Fist didn’t disappoint and won easily!”
Text message notifications resounded throughout the entire venue. They had received the rewards from betting.
Anyone who wasn’t an idiot would bet on Mo Xiu winning this match, so the audience was extremely excited.
The entire arena was in an uproar. The overwhelming cheers made it impossible to hear anything else.
At this moment, Xue Jin’s phone rang. He glanced at it before answering the call. Then, he lowered his head and said something as he walked towards the backstage.
Mo Xiu jumped off the stage and stopped Xue Jin.
Xue Jin roared, “Mo Xiu! Get out of my way! I’ll settle your matter later!”
The four or five people beside Xue Jin stood in front of Mo Xiu, protecting him as he left.
Mo Xiu raised his right hand to his head.
Xue Jin was somewhat puzzled as he held the phone. What was he doing? He looked like he was greeting someone.
The next moment, something unexpected happened.
A flying knife dagger out of thin air behind Xue Jin. As it spun, the back of the dagger hit the phone.
Xue Jin was caught off guard and the phone was sent flying. Then, the phone flew through the air in a perfect arc before landing in Mo Xiu’s hand.
Mo Xiu placed the phone to his ear and heard a voice coming from it.
“Hey! Hey! What happened? You have to make up for today’s loss.”
Mo Xiu replied, “I can make up for it, but… I’ve found you.”
Just as Xue Jin was about to order his men to snatch the phone back, another flying dagger appeared in the air and blocked their escape route. Mo Xiu took the opportunity to slip away.
The one who threw the flying dagger to cover Mo Xiu was naturally Mu Qingyi.
Mu Qingyi had always been in the arena. In fact, Mu Qingyi was present in every match that Mo Xiu appeared in.
It was also Mu Qingyi who had used her skill to snatch Xue Jin’s phone.
The mission Mo Xiu had assigned Mu Qingyi at the start was to enter the competition grounds to provide Mo Xiu with support.
Thus, the person who had been closest to Mo Xiu all this time was Mu Qingyi.
Mu Qingyi was unable to infiltrate the enemy, but her identity and background allowed her to enter the arena without being suspected.
Her parents had made all of her arrangements for her since she was young and had no freedom.
Now that the college entrance examination was over, she finally obtained a short period of freedom. It was not hard to understand why she had come here to find some excitement. There were many people who had the same situation as Mu Qingyi, so it would not attract Xue Jin’s attention.
Xue Jin roared, “Capture him quickly!”
At this moment, there was a commotion outside the crowd. Gradually, the entire place became quiet. Everyone realized that a battle was happening outside.
The battle did not last long. A group of people walked in from outside.
After seeing the clothes of these people, the entire place became silent.
The people who came were actually from the army. Why would they alert the army?
The leader pointed at Xue Jin and grabbed him.
Although Xue Jin was still unclear of the situation, he immediately activated his four skills to accelerate and run outside.
Five minutes later, Xue Jin was pushed back into the arena. No one could leave because the entire rooftop was under the military’s control.
“Xue Jin, I’m Ye Qingfeng from the military. Cooperate with the law enforcement team to capture you.”
Xue Jin sneered. “I’m just here to watch a competition. If you want to capture me, so be it.”
Ye Qingfeng took out a name list and held it up for everyone to see.
When Xue Jin saw the name list, he knew that he was finished.
Ye Qingfeng shouted, “This is the name list of all the people who are here today. We know your real identities. Whoever can give evidence of the person-in-charge can leave.”
Everyone shouted, “It’s him, Xue Jin!”
“That’s right, it’s him.”
Ye Qingfeng said, “Did you hear that? Xue Jin, I now have a lot of evidence to prove that you are the person-in-charge here. Do you have anything else to say?”
Xue Jin lowered his head and said no more.
Ye Qingfeng continued, “Tell me, who is your boss?”
“Who is my boss? I’m the boss. You’ve already investigated clearly. Why are you still asking who the boss is?”
Ye Qingfeng wasn’t in a hurry. He found a chair and sat down. “Mr. Mo, let’s begin the performance.”
At this moment, Mo Xiu and Mu Qingyi walked out from the crowd.
When Xue Jin saw Mo Xiu appear at this moment, he immediately understood and cursed.
“Mo Xiu, you bastard. I always thought that you were just a young man who was overly arrogant. I didn’t expect you to be so shrewd.”
Mo Xiu shook his head and said, “My performance wasn’t perfect. You were too confident. Tell me, who is the boss behind this? Who was the person who called you?”
Xue Jin replied, “He’s just a big client. Who can order me around?”
Mo Xiu smiled happily, very happily.
“Hahaha, is that so? I already know that your real source of profit isn’t the revenue from the bets, but from informing your boss behind the scenes of the outcome. Then, your boss will place a bet on the winning side, and you will reap the profits.”
Xue Jin stared straight at Mo Xiu as though he wanted to eat him.
Mo Xiu continued, “There are two benefits to this kind of profit source. Firstly, even if the law enforcement team comes to raid the arena, you won’t lose too much. Secondly, you can hide the boss behind the scenes.”
Xue Jin looked at Mo Xiu with lifeless eyes. He no longer had the mood to ask Mo Xiu how he knew, because he knew that he was finished.
In fact, Mo Xiu had discovered a clue after the first King’s War. When Xue Jin gave him his rewards, Xue Jin saw that his total income was three million yuan, yet Xue Jin had given him more than half of his income.
Later on, Mo Xiu always calculated the time and went to look for Xue Jin when Xue Jin and Zhang Siyuan were settling accounts. After a while, he finally confirmed that he had not seen things. The income they received from the arena was not high.
The arena could not afford to lose money, so there must be other ways to earn money. They could only participate in gambling.
After knowing the gambling method of the arena, Mo Xiu could finally confirm that if there was someone behind Xue Jin, then there was a high chance that he would personally come to the arena to watch the matches and bets. Even if that person did not come himself, he would send someone he absolutely trusted.
Thus, today, Mo Xiu had intentionally not followed the script during the battle, just to see how Xue Jin and the mysterious boss behind him would react.
Xue Jin had planned this battle for a very long time and attached great importance to it. Thus, he would definitely invest a large amount of money.
If there was a change in the outcome of the competition, then regardless of whether it was Xue Jin or the boss behind him who had placed the bets, they would definitely suffer a huge loss. At that time, they would definitely be furious.
When the competition ended, Xue Jin immediately received a call. Mo Xiu could already confirm that this boss behind the scenes definitely existed. Furthermore, judging from the speed of the call, this person should be present.
Mo Xiu continued, “I’ve got your phone now and reported the phone number to the law enforcement team. The law enforcement team has already found out that the owner of this phone number is here. Would you like to identify that person yourself, or would you like to trouble Captain Ye Qingfeng to find them?”
Xue Jin’s face was ashen as he said, “So what if you found who the person on the phone was? How can you be sure that the person who came is the mastermind?”
Mo Xiu pulled Mu Qingyi aside to make way.
Then, Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan brought someone over.
That person was Xue Jin’s accountant, Zhang Siyuan!


                    



Drawing in the Net (3)
Twenty minutes ago, Mo Xiu’s match had just begun.
After Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan entered the Sky Treasure Hotel, they quickly found the room number that Mo Xiu had informed them of.
The person living in this room was Xue Jin’s accountant, Zhang Siyuan.
Mo Xiu had only obtained the room number today. At that time, Mo Xiu had been walking around in the corridor. Xue Jin only felt that Mo Xiu’s emotions were not very stable after obtaining the script.
Liu Ziyang looked at Yue Yuan inquiringly. Was this the place? Yue Yuan nodded.
Liu Ziyang took out his dagger and nodded at Yue Yuan.
Then, Yue Yuan punched Liu Ziyang, and Liu Ziyang disappeared.
When he reappeared, he was already behind the door. He used the teleportation effect of his Afterimage skill to sneak in. This method was thought of by Yue Yuan.
When Liu Ziyang heard this method, he slapped his thigh and said that Yue Yuan was a talent.
Liu Ziyang, who entered the room, saw a person standing with his back facing the door. It looked like a bodyguard.
Liu Ziyang didn’t hesitate. He used the critical hit effect after the afterimage was activated and directly killed his opponent with a dagger. Then, he gently placed this person on the ground.
He silently chanted, “Amitabha, Amitabha.”
After opening the door, he sneaked in with Yue Yuan and found Zhang Siyuan looking at the computer seriously inside the room.
Liu Ziyang wanted to go up and grab Zhang Siyuan but was stopped by Yue Yuan.
Two seconds later, three beams of light appeared beneath Zhang Siyuan’s feet.
Zhang Siyuan’s reaction couldn’t be slow. He immediately pressed on the keyboard, wanting to destroy the data, but he was still a little slow and was frozen by Yue Yuan’s three-layered wood array.
Then, Yue Yuan and Liu Ziyang quickly controlled Zhang Siyuan.
According to Mo Xiu’s request, they found the account that had betted the largest amount through the back-end software.
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were both people who had seen the world. However, when they saw the betting amount, they were still stunned.
It was one billion yuan, a whole one billion. Who could have such wealth?
The two of them worked hard for a while before they found the name and bank account number associated with this account in the back-end software.
The bank account belonged to Wang Qiang. However, the two of them did not care as they knew that the name was definitely fake. The most important thing was the bank account number.
Then, they tied Zhang Siyuan up and rushed to the rooftop.
…
On the rooftop.
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan had just brought Zhang Siyuan out. Before Xue Jin could speak, a loud noise came from the stands.
“Boom!!!”
A huge fireball appeared out of nowhere in the stands, creating a disturbance.
Mo Xiu had not expected such a situation. The person behind the scenes might take the opportunity to escape.
On the other hand, Ye Qingfeng laughed.
“Hahahaha, if I wasn’t here today, you might have gotten your way, but you can’t run today.”
As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Qingfeng ran towards the spectator stands at an extremely fast speed. A second later, a person was thrown out of the stands and into the arena.
One of Ye Qingfeng’s skills was Lock, which allowed him to lock onto his target.
This person stood up and wanted to continue running, but he was controlled by Ye Qingfeng’s subordinates.
This person was wearing a mask as he glared at Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu chuckled and removed the person’s mask.
The moment his face was revealed, everyone was shocked. Many people knew this person, and it could even be said that he had a great reputation in Shun City.
He was the youngest son of the Shun City Lord, Qiu Qiu. It was hard to imagine that the person behind the scenes had such a powerful background.
Qiu Qiu was the top scholar of last year’s college entrance examination. Due to his outstanding results and the fact that he was the City Lord’s youngest son, the news was all over the place at that time. It could be said that he was a household name.
At that moment, Ye Qingfeng walked back and was shocked when he saw that it was Qiu Qiu.
“Qiu Qiu? It’s you? Why are you doing this?”
Qiu Qiu and Ye Qingfeng obviously knew each other. Qiu Qiu lowered his head and did not speak.
Ye Qingfeng continued, “I was originally cooperating with the law enforcement team and the Shadows to carry out a mission to capture someone. I didn’t expect to catch you. No matter what, I still have to hand you over to the law enforcement team to handle. As for the specific judgment, ask the City Lord.”
Ye Qingfeng lamented Qiu Qiu’s actions. He did not expect the son of the City Lord to do such a thing.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu had originally thought that the matter would be more complicated. Even with evidence, if Qiu Qiu had been hiding in the crowd, they would have needed a long time to investigate the situation.
He didn’t expect Qiu Qiu to jump out himself. This saved him a lot of trouble.
After Mo Xiu handed all the evidence and Zhang Siyuan to the enforcement team, the matter was considered to have come to an end.
At this moment, Qiu Qiu was handed over to the law enforcement team. When he walked past Mo Xiu, he spoke for the first time.
Qiu Qiu had already calmed down. He stared at Mo Xiu and smiled.
“Mo Xiu, I’ve lost to you once.”
Qiu Qiu’s words made Mo Xiu very uncomfortable. What did he mean by that? Could it be that he would still have the chance to take revenge after committing such a huge crime?
That was impossible! Under the current law, it was impossible even for the son of the City Lord to escape the law.
Afterwards, Xue Jin was also escorted over. Seeing that Mo Xiu did not speak, he only sighed softly.
The army cooperated with the law enforcement team and investigated everyone. All the relevant staff members in the arena were arrested.
At this moment, Mo Xiu saw two familiar faces — Boss Fang and his subordinates.
Boss Fang’s subordinate shouted at him, “F*ck you! Didn’t you say that there was nothing wrong with Mo Xiu? You even said that I’m not good at reading people, while you’re good at it! Look how good you are. You even managed to get a top spy in.”
Boss Fang said unhappily, “Mind your status. I’m your boss after all.”
The subordinate spat a mouthful of phlegm on Boss Fang’s face and said, “We’re f*cking going to jail. The company is gone. Why are you still acting like a boss?!”
After that, the two of them broke free from the control of the law enforcement team and started fighting. Mo Xiu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.
The rest of the audience had been released. Of course, they wouldn’t let them go just like that. Everyone’s real name was recorded by the law enforcement team now. Furthermore, those who could come here were all children from rich or powerful families. They could just look for them later.
The law enforcement team and Mo Xiu had a handover. As they had just solved a major case and had to investigate the spies, they could only go back and deal with it.
The crowd dispersed, but Ye Qingfeng stayed behind.
Ye Qingfeng sized up Mo Xiu with interest, making Mo Xiu feel uncomfortable.
Mo Xiu said, “Captain Ye, what’s the matter? Don’t look at me like that.”
Ye Qingfeng smiled embarrassedly and said, “It’s nothing. I was just thinking if it’s possible to poach you into our army.”
Mo Xiu smiled awkwardly.
Ye Qingfeng sighed and said, “Sigh! It’s a pity that you’re not under me. You performed very well this time. No! You can be said to be too outstanding. If I were you, I might not even be as good as you.”
Mo Xiu said respectfully, “Captain Ye is too humble. With your ability, you will definitely do better than me.”
“I’m talking about acting. Your acting skills are better than mine.”
Ye Qingfeng looked at Mo Xiu and the others. Then, he continued, “All of you, please take my contact details. If you need anything, you can look for me directly. You don’t have to look for me through the law enforcement team anymore. If you need any help, I will definitely help.”
Mo Xiu cupped his fists and said, “Thank you, Captain Ye.”
Then, Ye Qingfeng waved his hand and left.
Liu Ziyang was the first to step forward and say, “Boss, you’re too awesome. How did you come up with this plan?”
Yue Yuan and Mu Qingyi also looked at Mo Xiu questioningly.
“It’s nothing much. The plan was simple. We just needed to analyze the truth. Besides, that’s not what you should be praising.”
The three of them asked in unison, “Then what should we be praising you for?”
“Just as Captain Ye said, my acting skills are better. You can call me Movie King Mo in the future!”


                    



Dividing the Spoils
“You can call me Movie King Mo from now on.”
The serious topic was instantly diverted by Mo Xiu.
The three of them stared coldly at Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu smiled and said, “Alright! The mission’s over. Let’s divide the spoils!”
At the mention of dividing the spoils, the few of them became excited. Although other than Mo Xiu, the other three didn’t lack money. However, this was their first mission, and also their first time earning money. Thus, they were somewhat excited.
Mo Xiu took out his phone and opened the Shadow software to find the mission.
He realized that the mission had become a Grade-B mission. There was another explanation below.
“There was a system error in the assessment of the mission difficulty. The current level of the mission has increased from Grade-C to Grade-B. The point rewards have increased from 2,000 points to 8,000 points, and the cash reward has increased from 800,000 yuan to four million yuan.”
Liu Ziyang shouted, “F*ck, that’s a huge increase. That’s amazing.”
Yue Yuan rubbed his chin and said, “This reward is quite fair.”
When accepting the mission, Mo Xiu was the team leader, so all the rewards were sent to Mo Xiu’s account.
Mo Xiu split the rewards evenly into four portions. Thus, each person received 2,000 points and one million yuan.
At this moment, Mu Qingyi said, “Mo Xiu, this mission was almost completed by you alone. It’s not good for us to take so much, right?”
Yue Yuan added, “That’s right. We’ve helped too little. You’ve always been the one in danger and fighting with the enemy. We can’t take so much.”
In the end, Liu Ziyang also chimed in. “That’s right, Boss. I don’t need any rewards this time. I’ll just treat it as learning from you.”
Mo Xiu glared at Liu Ziyang and said, “Then what did you learn? If you didn’t learn anything, just keep the rewards. Alright, I’m the team leader. This matter is up to me. If you guys aren’t satisfied, you can be the team leader next time.”
After Mo Xiu finished speaking, Mu Qingyi and the others did not decline and could only accept the rewards.
Mo Xiu continued, “I originally wanted to take on a few more missions, but I didn’t expect this mission to take ten days. There are only five days left before I leave school. It seems like I can’t take on any other missions.”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan both looked regretful. This was because both of them felt that working with Mo Xiu was very comfortable and they could indeed learn some things.
Mu Qingyi said a little sadly, “Oh, let’s leave it at that. My journey is quite far, so I might have to leave for school in a few days.”
Mo Xiu sighed. “Sigh, are you leaving already?”
“Yes, I’m leaving.”
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan looked at each other and realized that the atmosphere wasn’t right. They wanted to slip away.
Right at this time, Mu Qingyi seemed to have intentionally changed the topic, her eyes widening as she said, “Aiya, I almost forgot something.”
Mo Xiu and the other two looked towards Mu Qingyi.
Mu Qingyi took out a bank card and handed it to Mo Xiu.
“All the money won from gambling is here.”
Mo Xiu had indeed given Mu Qingyi another mission previously, which was to bet all the money he earned from boxing on his victory. Then, she would take those winnings and bet on his victory again. Although she did not know how much money there was in the card, it was definitely not a small amount.
Mo Xiu smiled and took it. Then, he said to the three of them, “We’ll take this money…”
The three of them moved in unison and shook their heads vigorously.
Mo Xiu actually wanted to say, “Let’s split the money.” However, looking at the three of them, it was unlikely that they would accept it.
The three of them knew that they had already taken advantage of Mo Xiu for the mission reward. Furthermore, this money had nothing to do with them.
The few of them chatted for a while before heading downstairs.
Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were very sensible. As soon as they went downstairs, they found an excuse to leave.
Mo Xiu asked, “Where’s your house? I’ll send you back.”
Mu Qingyi nodded and said, “Sure, my house is in the villa district in the east of the city.”
The villa area in the east of the city was very far from here. Mo Xiu asked, “Do you want to take a taxi back? Or do you want someone to pick you up?”
Mu Qingyi revealed a brilliant smile and said, “Let’s take a walk.”
After saying those words, Mo Xiu continued walking forward. After standing there in a daze for a second, he shook his head, smiled, and gave chase.
“Mo Xiu, I didn’t have a childhood. Can you tell me about your childhood?”
Mo Xiu thought about it and said, “Based on what I can remember, I would run in the park in the morning, read books in the library in the afternoon, and practice boxing at night. When I started going to school, I would attend classes in the morning and practice boxing at night.”
Mu Qingyi looked at Mo Xiu as if she was looking at a monster and asked, “Why was your life so hard?”
“From a young age, my mother took great pains to take care of me. At that time, my mother had no job. I could tell that she was very tired, but she always smiled at me. At that time, I swore that I would become a man to take care of my mother.”
Mu Qingyi’s gaze towards Mo Xiu changed and became gentle. She did not know what to say for a moment.
Mo Xiu didn’t say anything either. The two of them walked quietly like this, as if they had returned to the stone at the Cosmic Tuition Class.
“Let me tell you about my childhood!”
A sudden sentence broke the silence. The two of them looked at each other and laughed.
“Hahaha, didn’t you say that you didn’t have a childhood?”
Mu Qingyi covered her mouth and laughed lightly. “I feel that I had more of a childhood compared to you.”
“Alright then, tell me about it!”
“I… I’ve seen other people jumping rope when I was young. Have you played it before?”
Mo Xiu shook his head and said, “What is that?”
Mu Qingyi’s eyes shifted mischievously as she said, “It involves a witch using an incantation to activate a rubber band.”
Mo Xiu asked in confusion, “A witch? An incantation? What’s that?”
“Oh my, you’re so stupid. When a witch uses an incantation, the rubber band will move on its own.”
“An incantation? Are you talking about a skill?”
“No, it’s not like that. I remember the incantation goes something like this. The Malan Flower blooms 21, 28256, 28257,
282931
…”
Mo Xiu’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Really?”
“Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha…”
Mu Qingyi laughed until she was swaying back and forth.
When Mo Xiu saw Mu Qingyi laughing like this, he immediately understood that Mu Qingyi was lying to him.
Mo Xiu looked at Mu Qingyi with a straight face and said, “To think that I, Movie King Mo, trusted you so much. You actually teased me.”
When Mu Qingyi heard Mo Xiu’s words, she laughed even more happily. She held her stomach as she squatted on the ground, almost bursting into tears.
Mo Xiu asked, “Is it that funny?”
Mu Qingyi said, “Yes, I’ve never been so happy before. Perhaps I’ve never been so relaxed before.”
Mo Xiu pretended to be innocent and said, “Alright, since you’re so happy teasing me, I’ll let you tease me every day from now on.”
Mu Qingyi stood up and walked a few steps forward. She turned around and said, “Who wants to tease you? How shameless!”
Mo Xiu chased after her and shrugged. “What if I tease you?”
Mu Qingyi stuck out her tongue and said, “That won’t do either!”
The two of them continued to walk forward. Mu Qingyi suddenly said, “Mo Xiu, if only we could continue walking and not go home.”
“Yes. I’ll walk with you.”
…
The two of them walked from dawn to sunrise, from sunrise to late in the morning, and finally reached Mu Qingyi’s house.
The two didn’t say goodbye when they parted, because they both knew that they would definitely meet again.
That night, Mo Xiu took the longest walk of his life. That night, Mo Xiu said the most words in his life.

Buying a House
Mo Xiu didn’t go home immediately. He sent a message to his mother and told her that he would return tonight.
After that, Mo Xiu checked the balance in his bank card. The total amount in his card was 15,322,443 yuan.
Mo Xiu leaned closer to the screen and carefully counted the amount.
“Damn, there’s over 15 million yuan!”
With so much money, Mo Xiu could no longer remain calm. After some thought, he gave Zheng Yi a call.
“Hello, Mo Xiu. Why haven’t you been picking up my calls these few days?”
“I was busy with something these few days. It wasn’t convenient for me to call.”
“What’s the matter? I knew you had taken Mu Qingyi down. You two went to have some alone time, right? How awesome.”
“Stop talking nonsense. Are you free now? Come out for a while.”
“I’m free. What do you want to do?”
“Come and fetch me. I have something to ask you. I’m at…”
Mo Xiu hung up the call. He had nothing to do while waiting for Zheng Yi, so he looked through his phone.
When he opened the Shadow Software, a notification popped up.
“You have received 2,000 points. The Points Mall has opened.”
Mo Xiu realized that there was really a Points Mall option beside his profile.
Mo Xiu felt that the Points Mall must be very high-end. There would definitely be some herbs inside.
When he opened it, he was dumbfounded. What was this?
“One hundred pounds of rice for one point.”
“One pair of designer shoes for two points.”
“One car for 100 points.”
“One pig for 10 points.”
What the hell was this? It was practically a grocery store. There was even a pig that actually cost 10 points. Oh, sorry, pork was indeed expensive now.
Just as Mo Xiu was about to curse, he realized that the Points Mall was the same as his shopping application. It recommended popular products to him.
Mo Xiu couldn’t help but wonder what kind of people among the Shadows paid attention to such things.
He found the classification search bar and took a look at what was available. This Points Mall was really all-encompassing. It had everything from divine-grade herbs weapons to socks and shoes.
Mo Xiu took a quick look and found a herb that he was more familiar with, the Spirit Ring. The price of one Spirit Ring was 50,000 points.
It seemed that herbs were expensive no matter where they were sold. He had only received 8,000 points from a Grade-B mission, while a Spirit Ring cost 50,000 points.
As he flipped through the products, a car horn sounded. Mo Xiu looked up and saw that it was Zheng Yi.
After Mo Xiu got into the car, Zheng Yi asked, “Where have you been these past few days? You practically vanished into thin air. Why did you call me out the moment you appeared?”
“I want to buy a house for my mother.”
“Where?”
“I want to buy a house that’s near your place. I hope that someone can take care of my mother.”
Zheng Yi thought for a while before gritting his teeth and saying, “Alright, the houses near my house are a little expensive. I might not be able to afford them, but the prices of the houses in the neighborhood are still acceptable. I’ll borrow money from my dad to buy them for you.”
“There’s no need for that. I’ll just buy a house in your neighborhood, preferably a house next to yours.”
Zheng Yi glared at him and said, “Mo Xiu, you’re pushing your luck. Where can I get you that much money?”
Mo Xiu said angrily, “Who told you to use your money to buy me a house? I’ll buy the house myself. I’ll visit your house later and ask your parents to take care of my mom.”
Zheng Yi was stunned. Mo Xiu asked, “What’s wrong? Is there a problem?”
Zheng Yi said, “Mo Xiu, the house next to mine might cost five million yuan.”
“Yeah, that’s no problem.”
“That’s right. I know you can’t afford it, but… Ah?!! Are you telling me that there’s no problem?!!”
Mo Xiu couldn’t stand Zheng Yi’s nagging anymore, so he pulled Zheng Yi out of the car and looked at his balance again.
When he returned to the car, Zheng Yi asked worriedly, “Mo Xiu, you… You haven’t been provided for by a rich lady over the past few days, right? Which rich lady is so rich?”
Mo Xiu simply couldn’t take it anymore. He slammed the car door shut and said, “Cut the crap. Let’s go. We’ll move tomorrow after we’re done here today.”
Zheng Yi wanted to ask more, but seeing that Mo Xiu was unhappy, he could only give up. Then, he drove back to his house.
Mo Xiu first bought some gifts and went home with Zheng Yi. Although Zheng Yi’s family background wasn’t as extravagant as Mu Qingyi, Liu Ziyang, and Yue Yuan’s, they were still considered extremely wealthy.
Mr. Zheng worked in a security company. He had high prestige and status there.
Bodyguards were considered top jobs in today’s society because many people who were good at business did not have the strength to protect themselves. They could only hire bodyguards to guard themselves.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Zheng was a businesswoman and had a small company. Thus, the Zheng family was quite famous in the area.
Zheng Yi’s parents weren’t old-fashioned people. Mo Xiu had come to the Zheng family’s house once before and both of them had a good impression of him.
Now that they knew that Mo Xiu was the top scholar in the college entrance examination, they praised Mo Xiu in front of Zheng Yi.
After Mo Xiu made some polite remarks, he explained his intentions. Mr. Zheng agreed without any hesitation.
After that, he even helped Mo Xiu communicate with his neighbor, who quickly agreed to sell the house to Mo Xiu.
After an entire afternoon of handling the procedures, this house belonged to Mo Xiu. It cost 5.5 million.
The neighbor had also agreed to move out the next day. The people who could live here definitely had more than just this property. On account of Mr. Zheng, as well as the fact that Mo Xiu was the top scholar of the college entrance examination, the other party was very willing to give Mo Xiu this favor.
Before Mo Xiu left, he felt a little embarrassed. Mr. Zheng was so busy with work, yet he even took the entire afternoon to help Mo Xiu.
Mo Xiu felt a little apologetic. He had to thank the Zheng family in the future.
Mo Xiu had been busy the entire day and only returned home around 9 pm.
The moment he entered the house, she saw a figure and a table full of food.
His mother was still the same. Mo Xiu sat at the table and looked at the scattered white hair on her mother’s head, feeling a little upset.
His hard work over the years had paid off. He could let his mother lead a better life.
However, her mother had been too tired and lonely all these years. She had been guarding such a home alone.
“Xiao Xiu, you haven’t been home for the next few days. Many admission notices have been sent home. You can go and take a look at which school you want to go to before replying to them.”
Her mother pointed to a bag on the sofa.
After the college entrance examination ended, the various universities would send admission notices to the students who wanted to be admitted. The students would choose which school they wanted to go to. Then, they would need to send a message to the designated number on the notice.
“Mom, let’s not talk about this for now. I bought you a house near Zheng Yi’s house so that we can take care of one another. We’ll move there tomorrow. By the way, you should quit your job too.”
Li Yuan looked at her son seriously and said, “Xiao Xiu, where did you get the money?”
“Mom, I earned the money from doing missions. Don’t worry, I’m doing the right thing.”
“Missions? As long as you can walk the right path, I’m alright with anything.”
“Mom, can we move there tomorrow?”
“Alright! Alright!”
…
After dinner, Mo Xiu returned to his room with a bag of admission notices.
He spread them out on the bed and realized that there were probably more than a hundred cards.
Although the news of Mo Xiu being the top scorer had been blocked, the universities weren’t stupid. They all extended their olive branches to him.
He opened one of them and took a look. The reward was 200,000 yuan.
Mo Xiu hadn’t expected that his status as the top scholar of the college entrance examination would allow him to start earning money.
However, Mo Xiu wasn’t interested in these things. He just wanted to see what conditions Yanjing University had offered.
Mo Xiu only wanted to go to the best school. No matter what the other schools offered, he wouldn’t go.
After flipping through for a long time, he finally found the notice from Yanjing University.
There was only one reward for accepting the offer. His tuition fees would be free as he would receive a full scholarship.
Mo Xiu smiled. Yanjing University was indeed confident and did not give him any special privileges.
He sent a message to the number on the notice.
“Shun City First High School, Mo Xiu, 1,000 marks for the college entrance examination.”


                    



Moving
The next morning, his mother went to the office to resign. Mo Xiu also woke up early to pack up and move.
However, when Mo Xiu looked around, there didn’t seem to be anything he wanted to take. It was just some old furniture. The new house was full of furniture left behind by the upper-class family.
It was not a problem to move there first. If there was anything he needed to change, he could buy it later on. There was really no need to move the things at home.
After tidying up, there were only some clothes and a backpack that his mother had packed yesterday. Thus, there were a total of two bags.
When his mother returned, they each took a backpack and left.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi was ordered by Mr. Zheng to pick up Mo Xiu and Li Yuan. The three of them chatted for a while before arriving at their new home.
The new house was a small villa with a huge living room. There was a bathroom, a kitchen, and two guest rooms on the first floor. Meanwhile, there were three bedrooms and a study on the second floor. The decor was simple and was Mo Xiu’s favorite style.
Li Yuan entered the spacious new house with a calm expression as usual. She was not as excited as Mo Xiu had imagined.
Speaking of which, Mo Xiu had never seen his mother emotional before. She had always been so elegant and peaceful.
Li Yuan looked around briefly and said to Mo Xiu, “Son, thank you!”
Seeing that his mother was satisfied, Mo Xiu was relieved. He sat down on the sofa and said, “Mom, I’m your son. There’s no need to thank me.”
When Li Yuan saw Zheng Yi, who was standing at the side, she suddenly woke up and said, “Xiao Xiu, why didn’t you remind me? The two of us should have visited the Zheng family first. Let’s go!”
Zheng Yi said from the side, “Auntie, my dad said that there’s no need to rush over. My parents are at work today, so he asked me to accompany you. After you guys have settled down, please come over for dinner tonight.”
Upon hearing this, Li Yuan nodded and started packing.
Mo Xiu wanted to help, but his mother arranged for him to accompany Zheng Yi.
Zheng Yi was also helpless. He was here to help, but now, Li Yuan had arranged for Mo Xiu to accompany him.
There wasn’t much luggage anyway, so Mo Xiu left his mother to sort it out. Then, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi sat in the living room and chatted.
However, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi didn’t have much free time as Li Yuan wasn’t satisfied with the arrangement of some furniture.
The two of them went from being treated as VIPs to being laborers. The entire morning passed.
The villa Li Yuan had tidied up looked even grander. The furniture was placed naturally.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi looked at Li Yuan in confusion. She was so talented that she could design a house for others.
After Li Yuan was done with her work, she said to Mo Xiu, “Xiao Xiu, Xiao Yi, that’s about it. I took a look, and saw that the furniture and decorations don’t need to be touched. We can just use them. We’re not unreasonable people after all. However, we still need to buy new bedding and bedroom necessities. Why don’t we go out and buy some?”
Zheng Yi was used to being unrestrained. He had been holding it in for the entire morning, so he immediately got up.
“Auntie, no problem. We’ll leave now!”
The three of them left in high spirits. Since it was already noon, they had a simple meal and headed straight to the shopping center.
Li Yuan said hesitantly, “Little Yi, we’re just buying some simple things. There’s no need to come here. The things sold here are a little expensive.”
Zheng Yi said casually, “Auntie, Mo Xiu has plenty of money now. Don’t worry.”
Mo Xiu also gave his mother a reassuring look.
As soon as Li Yuan entered the mall, she started picking out the things that she needed at home. Soon, she returned with a full load.
After that, Li Yuan proposed to buy some ingredients and gifts. After all, they were going to the Zheng family’s house for dinner. It was their first visit, so they should get something.
As soon as they started buying, another pile was formed. Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi, the two laborers, were all over the place.
When they were about to leave, they passed by a dress shop. Mo Xiu said, “Mom, you should buy one. After all, we have to go for dinner today.”
Li Yuan was a little hesitant. She had already spent a lot of Mo Xiu’s money. She didn’t want Mo Xiu to spend so much money on a dress. However, when she thought about going to the Zheng family’s house for a meal, she felt that it would be rude to dress too casually.
In the end, she was dragged in by Mo Xiu. Li Yuan did not like to show off and chose a simple black dress.
The shopping trip finally came to an end. The spoils of war filled Zheng Yi’s car to the brim.
When Li Yuan saw this situation, she felt a little embarrassed.
When they got home, the three of them packed up again. Once they were done, it was already 5 pm.
Zheng Yi said, “Auntie, my mom should be back by now. Should we go over?”
Li Yuan quickly put down her work and said, “Okay, we’ll go over now. Xiao Xiu, take the gifts and ingredients. We’ll go over to their house.”
The three of them arrived at the Zheng family’s house. Mrs. Zheng was also a very easygoing person. The moment she met Li Yuan, she started chatting. After chatting for a while, the two of them went to the kitchen to cook.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi sat on the sofa in boredom.
Zheng Yi asked, “Mo Xiu, are you going to Yanjing University?”
“Yeah, I just texted them yesterday. How about you?”
“Of course I won’t let you off. I’m also going to Yanjing, but I’m not going to Yanjing University. Yanjing University’s admission score this year is too scary. My results were actually not accepted.”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “It’s fine. At least we’re still in the same city.”
Zheng Yi nodded.
Just then, Mr. Zheng returned home. Li Yuan quickly came out of the kitchen to greet him.
Mr. Zheng jokingly said, “Yo, it’s such a rare day today. Two hostesses are actually cooking personally. We’re in for a treat.”
Then, Mr. Zheng took off his coat and sat on the sofa.
“Mo Xiu, let’s upgrade today’s party. Get all your friends here. We’ll have a good time.”
Mr. Zheng had heard from Zheng Yi that Mo Xiu had been working hard since he was young. He spent most of his time training and had very few friends. Hence, he got Mo Xiu to bring his friends over.
Mo Xiu felt a little embarrassed. After all, this wasn’t his home.
“Uncle, I don’t think that’s a good idea. I can invite them another day. Let’s just have a meal together today.”
Mr. Zheng pretended to be angry and said, “Why? Are you treating Uncle as an outsider? Hurry up and look for your friends now. We will be eating soon.”
Mo Xiu tried to decline again, but Mr. Zheng insisted. Thus, Mo Xiu could only compromise.
Mo Xiu picked up the phone and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. How could he have any friends? It seemed like he had failed in his life all these years.
In the end, after thinking about it, Mu Qingyi should have already left by now. Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were the only two other people he had a good relationship with, so he should find these two.
When Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan picked up Mo Xiu’s call, they both accepted his offer immediately.
Mo Xiu returned to the sofa and said, “Uncle, Zheng Yi also knows that I don’t have many friends. I only called two friends over today.”
Mr. Zheng smiled and said, “Alright, there are many young people today. I’ll be younger too.”
Not long after, Liu Ziyang came. The moment he entered, he cupped his fists and said to Mr. Zheng, “I’m Liu Ziyang, sorry for disturbing you today.”
Mr. Zheng didn’t get angry because of Liu Ziyang’s actions. Instead, he kept praising Liu Ziyang for being interesting.
Liu Ziyang was also studying at Yanjing University. Thus, the conversation topic among the three young people was naturally related to Yanjing.
At first, Mr. Zheng didn’t think much of it, but the more he listened, the more shocked he became.
In the end, he finally figured out Liu Ziyang’s identity. He was the son of the Liu Corporation in Beijing, which was a company that had a certain amount of authority in Beijing. He was actually Mo Xiu’s friend.
Mr. Zheng was shocked that Mo Xiu could make such a friend. He even saw that Liu Ziyang kept calling Mo Xiu “Boss”. Mr. Zheng truly couldn’t understand Mo Xiu.
However, Mr. Zheng gradually calmed down. He felt gratified that his son could make such a friend.


                    



Mo Xiu’s Identity
The three young men were chatting enthusiastically when the door rang.
Mo Xiu heard someone knocking on the door. It should be Yue Yuan. He was about to open the door.
However, the moment he moved, Mr, Zheng stopped him.
“You guys chat, I’ll open the door!”
Mr. Zheng stood up and opened the door. Then, he was shocked to see the person at the door.
“Uncle Zheng?”
“Young boss? Why are you here?”
Yue Yuan took a few steps back and looked at the door sign. “That’s right. Mo Xiu said he had moved and wanted me to join in the fun. Did I walk in the wrong direction?”
Mr. Zheng turned around and looked at Mo Xiu. Why did this young lad who grew up in the slums have so much power?
If the Liu Corporation was beyond the reach of the government, then the power behind this person could absolutely be said to be the local tyrant of Shun City.
The security company that Mr. Zheng worked for was under Yue Yuan’s father, Yue Long.
One of the two people whom Mr. Zheng admired the most in his life was the City Lord, Qiu Qiming, who had saved an entire city. The other person was Yue Long, who had come to Shun City alone and started from scratch to become one of the top people in Shun City within ten years.
“Uncle Zheng! Uncle Zheng! Is Mo Xiu here? If not, I’ll take my leave first. I’ll visit again in the future.”
Only then did Mr. Zheng react. Then, he hurriedly said, “Yes, Mo Xiu is here. Come in.”
Everyone was here, and the dishes were ready. Mr. Zheng, Liu Ziyang, and Yue Yuan were chatting. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi helped to serve the dishes.
The few of them sat down. Then, Li Yuan changed and came out. Everyone was stunned.
Li Yuan’s temperament was too compatible with this set of clothes. Normally, one would not be used to wearing such clothes.
However, Li Yuan did not seem that way at all. She placed her hand on her abdomen and walked over slowly. It was as if Li Yuan should have been wearing such clothes all along.
Mo Xiu also suddenly felt that his mother shouldn’t have suffered so much all these years. His mother should have led such a life.
Seeing that everyone was staring at her, Li Yuan felt a little embarrassed. Thinking that everyone was waiting for her, she jogged to the dining table.
Mrs. Zheng said, “Everyone, please try our cooking.”
Mr. Zheng first picked up a piece of chicken and put it into his mouth. After savoring it carefully, he said, “Honey, it’s great! Your culinary skills haven’t decreased at all. It still tastes the same!”
Mrs. Zheng snapped, “Mo Xiu’s mother made this!”
Mr. Zheng smiled awkwardly and picked up another vegetable dish to savor.
“Mmm, honey, this dish is really good!”
Mrs. Zheng rolled her eyes at him and said, “She made this too.”
Mr. Zheng couldn’t hide his embarrassment anymore. Why was his wife’s signature dish made by someone else?
In the end, he could only say, “Ms. Li, your cooking skills are really good.”
Zheng Yi was secretly laughing when Mr. Zheng glared at him.
Mo Xiu sighed. It seemed that Zheng Yi’s joker tendencies ran in the family.
Everyone was talking and laughing during the meal. Mr. Zheng, Mrs. Zheng, and Li Yuan were not old-fashioned people. They chatted with the children.
Finally, they talked about Li Yuan. Mrs. Zheng said, “Ms. Li, what do you plan to do in the future? We can get along well. Why don’t you come to my company and be my secretary?”
Mr. Zheng interrupted, “Hey! How can you let her work for you?”
Mrs. Zheng didn’t know Mo Xiu’s current identity, but Mr. Zheng knew.
During this meal, Mr. Zheng understood that Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan were sincere towards Mo Xiu. Not only that, they were also respectful towards him.
For example, Liu Ziyang always called Mo Xiu “Boss.” It seemed as if the two of them really treated Mo Xiu as their boss.
With the status and spirit of these two young masters, Mr. Zheng would never believe that they were willing to treat Mo Xiu as their boss without being told by their elders to do so.
Hence, Father Zheng concluded that Mo Xiu had an unknown identity that even the local tyrant of Shun City, Yue Long, feared.
Now, it was not about taking care of Li Yuan. He had to be more respectful to Li Yuan and not anger her.
After hearing Mr. Zheng’s words, Mrs. Zheng did not say anything else.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi said, “Dad, Mom, I saw today that Auntie has a very good house setup.”
Mr. Zheng and Mrs. Zheng both looked at Li Yuan. Li Yuan said, “I don’t dare to say I’m good at it, but I do like it.”
Mrs. Zheng said, “I have a friend who owns a renovation company. Are you interested in becoming an interior decoration consultant?”
Without waiting for Li Yuan’s reply, Yue Yuan said, “Auntie, my father has a company like this under his name. It’s not small. If you’re willing, I can transfer the ownership of this company to you.”
Everyone looked at Yue Yuan in shock. This was what it meant to be rich. One word and he would give them a company!
Mo Xiu also looked at Yue Yuan strangely. What happened today?
In reality, after the last mission, Yue Yuan had told Yue Long about Mo Xiu when he returned home.
When Yue Long heard that Mo Xiu was related to Elder Tang, and that Mo Xiu was a poor fellow, he had a good impression of Mo Xiu.
Li Yuan looked at Yue Yuan, then looked at Mo Xiu. Then, she said, “Thank you, but I’m not capable enough. I’ll train first. I think Mrs. Zheng’s job offer is quite suitable for me.”
Yue Yuan wanted to persuade her but Mo Xiu shook his head and said, “Okay, Auntie. Mo Xiu will be going to Yanjing in a few days. If you need anything, you can look for me directly.”
Liu Ziyang could not take it anymore. He patted Yue Yuan’s chest and said, “Hey, hey, hey, hey, that’s enough. It’s a little too much. You’re so attentive!”
Zheng Yi interrupted, “Haha, I also think that Old Yue is a little too much.”
Zheng Yi was naturally approachable. In just one meal, he got along well with Liu Ziyang.
Mr. Zheng saw that his son was behaving inappropriately and scolded him. “Zheng Yi!”
Zheng Yi rolled his eyes and lowered his head to eat without saying another word.
Meanwhile, Mo Xiu said to Mrs. Zheng, “Then I’ll have to trouble Auntie to introduce my mother to the job.”
Mrs. Zheng was the boss of a small company after all. Thus, she could tell that something was wrong with the atmosphere at the dining table.
“Hey, okay. Don’t be so polite with me. It’s not a big deal.”
After the meal, Mo Xiu and Li Yuan left first.
Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang and Yue Yuan chatted enthusiastically with Zheng Yi for a while before leaving.
When Yue Yuan walked to the door, he said to Father Zheng, “Uncle Zheng, if Auntie Li Yuan needs anything, please let me know immediately.”
Mr. Zheng said, “Alright, I understand!”
After the two of them left, Mr. Zheng asked Zheng Yi, “Do you know what other identities Mo Xiu has?”
Zheng Yi was a little confused as he shook his head. “No, isn’t Mo Xiu normal?”
Mrs. Zheng asked, “What exactly happened? I didn’t dare to speak just now.”
Mr. Zheng said, “Liu Ziyang is the son of the Liu Corporation. That’s right! I’m talking about the Liu Corporation in Yanjing. Meanwhile, Yue Yuan is the son of my boss. Do you understand what I mean?”
Mrs. Zheng was so shocked that she could not speak. The status of these two people far exceeded her own.
Meanwhile, Zheng Yi could not believe that the two people he was talking to just now had such a background.
“Dad, are you sure? How could Mo Xiu know them?”
Seeing his father glare at him, Zheng Yi could only lower his head and say, “Damn, this is awesome. It’ll be easier for him to survive in Yanjing.”
Mr. Zheng looked at his unstable son and asked seriously, “Zheng Yi, tell me honestly, how close are you to Mo Xiu?”
Zheng Yi thought about it and said, “It’s hard to say how close we are. Let’s put it this way.”
“We share a life-and-death relationship!”


                    



Soaring Dragon Hotel
For the next two days, Mo Xiu was very relaxed. He accompanied his mother everywhere and felt very comfortable.
Mo Xiu might not be back for a long time after going to Yanjing, so he wanted to spend more time with his mother.
Today was the 14th day of his holiday. Mo Xiu would be leaving for Yanjing tomorrow, so he was watching his mother pack his luggage.
At this moment, there was a knock on the door.
When Mo Xiu opened the door, he saw that it was Zheng Yi. Before Zheng Yi could speak, Mo Xiu had already closed the door.
Zheng Yi shouted from outside, “Hey! Mo Xiu! I have something to talk to you about!”
Mo Xiu replied, “Didn’t I tell you not to look for me these few days?”
Zheng Yi knocked a few more times and said, “Quick, open the door. I have an appointment with Ye Qian’er and Liu Qingyu today.”
Only then did Mo Xiu remember that he had always wanted to treat the two of them to a meal, but he had never had the time to do so.
After Mo Xiu opened the door, Zheng Yi came in and ran to the sofa to complain to Li Yuan.
“Auntie, tell me about Mo Xiu. He only has a few friends. Is he trying to lose another one by locking me outside?”
Li Yuan knew about the relationship between Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi. Thus,she definitely knew that he was joking.
She pretended to be angry and said to Mo Xiu, “Xiao Xiu, how could you do this to Zheng Yi? Quickly go and meet your classmates.”
Zheng Yi looked at Mo Xiu smugly. Meanwhile, Mo Xiu looked at his mother. He probably wouldn’t be able to accompany his mother today.
Thus, Mo Xiu tidied up briefly before following Zheng Yi out.
After getting into the car, Mo Xiu asked, “Why did you invite them to a meal today?”
Zheng Yi said sarcastically, “Hey! How do we have to cheek to ask a busy bee like you out? How do you have the time?! You disappeared for ten days the moment you went on vacation and then came back to move. If I didn’t forcefully drag you out today, wouldn’t you still be busy?”
Mo Xiu knew that he was in the wrong and could only change the topic. “Where are we going to eat today?”
At the mention of this topic, Zheng Yi proudly took out a card and handed it to Mo Xiu.
“Isn’t this the diamond membership card of the Soaring Dragon Hotel?”
Mo Xiu was shocked. The Soaring Dragon Hotel was the most luxurious hotel in the city. If Mr. Zheng had this card, Mo Xiu would believe it. However, how could Zheng Yi have this card? It was impossible!
“Zheng Yi, did you steal your dad’s card?”
When Zheng Yi heard this, he acted arrogantly.
“This is my card. Yesterday, I sent a message to ask if Yue Yuan had any good restaurants to recommend. He simply gave me this.”
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “I didn’t expect you to be in contact with Yue Yuan. Did your father instruct you to interact more with Yue Yuan?”
Having been seen through, Zheng Yi said unhappily, “It’s none of your business! However, my dad’s membership card is only a platinum card. When I brought this card back yesterday, my dad’s shameless expression made me laugh.”
Mo Xiu sighed. Zheng Yi was really shameless. He even teased his own father.
They sped all the way to the Soaring Dragon Hotel. Liu Qingyu was already waiting there.
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi alighted from the car and immediately went forward to welcome him.
Mo Xiu was the first to speak. “Brother Liu, you’re early. Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s hurry up and go in!”
Liu Qingyu was still as graceful and courteous as ever. Cupping his hands, he said, “Eh? What are you saying? I also just arrived.”
The three of them walked into the hotel lobby. As soon as they entered, they saw golden lights everywhere.
Unlike the main hall of other restaurants, this place only had a receptionist, a spacious hall, and rows of sofas.
The Soaring Dragon Hotel did not have a bar for guests. Instead, the lobby was specially used to receive guests. As they had a membership system, it only received members.
Zheng Yi went to talk to the front desk while Mo Xiu and Liu Qingyu sat on the sofa and chatted.
Mo Xiu said, “Brother Liu, thank you for helping me during my absence.”
Liu Qingyu waved his hand and said, “It’s nothing. The three of us are old acquaintances. If we can help, of course we have to help.”
Before Mo Xiu could reply, Zheng Yi had already returned.
Mo Xiu asked, “Are you done?”
“No problem. We got the best room. Shall we go up first?”
Mo Xiu looked at the entrance. Ye Qian’er had not arrived yet.
Zheng Yi immediately understood and said to Liu Qingyu, “Qingyu, let’s go up first and have Mo Xiu stay behind to wait for Ye Qian’er.”
“Alright, you guys go up first. I’ll stay and wait.”
At this moment, Ye Qian’er hurriedly ran into the main hall, holding her knees as she panted heavily. She lifted her head and saw Mo Xiu.
She jogged over to Mo Xiu, but when she stood in front of Mo Xiu, he didn’t know what to say.
She bowed and said, “Senior Mo, I’m sorry I’m late.”
Mo Xiu quickly stood up and helped Ye Qian’er up. “Hahaha, what are you doing? I’m treating you to a meal today. Why are you apologizing?”
Ye Qian’er stood up straight, not knowing what to say.
Mo Xiu smiled and said, “Let’s go. Follow me.”
Ye Qian’er followed behind Mo Xiu and pouted. She had embarrassed herself again!
…
On the eighth floor, in a lively and elegant room…
Just as Zheng Yi had said, this was the best room. Not only did it have a dining table, it also had a bedroom, a lounge, and even a swimming pool. It was a simple villa.
Before they entered the room, the dishes had already been served. The table was full of dishes, but Mo Xiu couldn’t even name any of them.
The few of them were currently chatting enthusiastically.
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi once again thanked Liu Qingyu and Ye Qian’er. To be able to help at the most difficult time, they truly valued the friendship among them.
Zheng Yi asked, “Qingyu, which school are you going to? Your grades should be enough for Yanjing University, right?”
Liu Qingyu smiled. “Yes, my score is high enough, but I don’t like Yanjing. I’m going to Wu Country instead.”
Mo Xiu was a little surprised that someone could get into Yanjing University, yet did not go there.
“Brother Liu, why is that so? Is there anything wrong with Yanjing?”
Liu Qingyu shook his head and said, “It’s not that Yanjing is bad. It’s just that I don’t want to go because of some personal reasons.”
Seeing that Liu Qingyu was unwilling to speak, Mo Xiu did not probe further.
Seeing that Ye Qian’er was still a little reserved, Mo Xiu asked, “Ye Qian’er, you’re already in your third year of high school when the school year starts again. Which university are you planning to enroll in next?”
Zheng Yi teased, “That’s right. Sister Qian’er, where are you going to apply? Are you going to Yanjing to look for Mo Xiu?”
Mo Xiu had wanted Ye Qian’er to relax, but after hearing Zheng Yi’s words, he felt even more uneasy.
Meanwhile, Ye Qian’er looked at Mo Xiu and quickly lowered her head again. Mo Xiu glared at Zheng Yi. He truly caused trouble all day.
At this moment, Ye Qian’er’s phone rang. She took it out and hung up after taking a look.
Mo Xiu asked, “What’s wrong? Who called you? It’s okay, just pick it up.”
Ye Qian’er shook her head and whispered, “It’s nothing. It’s just an unimportant phone call.”
Before Ye Qian’er could finish her sentence, another call came in.
Seeing that Ye Qian’er seemed a little unhappy, Mo Xiu said, “It’s okay, you can pick up the call!”
Ye Qian’er nodded and went to the side to answer the call.
…
The meal ended very quickly. The four of them walked out of the restaurant and prepared to part ways.
Ye Qian’er lowered her head with a flushed face, not daring to speak to Mo Xiu until they separated.
After everyone left, she clenched her fists and muttered to herself, “Ye Qian’er, you’re so useless. You didn’t even bid Senior Mo farewell properly.”
Since they were leaving Shun City tomorrow, everyone went home to make preparations.
Mo Xiu had just reached home when his phone rang. He took it out and saw that it was Yue Yuan.
“Hello, Mo Xiu. I just arrived at the Soaring Dragon Hotel. Why did you leave?”
“If there’s nothing, you can just leave. Thank you.”
“Hey, why are you thanking me? Alright then, go on with your work. Let’s keep in touch in the future.”
Mo Xiu didn’t expect Yue Yuan to personally make a trip there.


                    



Yanjing University
They got off the train and left the station.
Mo Xiu stood outside Yanjing Station and looked at the city.
He could only see the surrounding buildings. He could only see a corner of this city.
However, this was the first time Mo Xiu had come to another city, to a place he was completely unfamiliar with.
This was a new beginning. Who knew what would happen in the future?
Liu Ziyang patted Mo Xiu and pulled Mo Xiu back from his emotional state.
“Boss, we’ve reached Yanjing. Come to my house first.”
Mo Xiu thought for a while and said, “I think I’ll go to school first. I’ll definitely visit your house in Yanjing, but I haven’t settled down yet. It’s a little abrupt.”
Liu Ziyang nodded and said, “Boss, you think too much. Anyway, I’ve been away for so long. No matter what, I have to go home first.”
Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi wanted to part ways with Liu Ziyang, but they didn’t expect three cars to drive over as soon as the three of them arrived at the roadside.
Liu Ziyang smiled and said, “Boss, Zheng Yi, I’ve already made arrangements. I’m going home. Boss will go straight to Yanjing University. Zheng Yi, you go to school too. Each of you will get a car.”
Zheng Yi did not hold back and got into the car. After he got into the car, he stuck his head out and said, “I didn’t expect to receive such treatment as well. I’m leaving first. I’ll contact you again after school starts tomorrow.”
After saying that, he told the driver to drive off. Meanwhile, Liu Ziyang said to Mo Xiu, “Boss, I’m going home to see my dad first. I’ll go to school to look for you later.”
“Good. I’ll check out the school first. I’ll see you later.”
Mo Xiu got into the car and said to the driver, “Let’s go to Yanjing University.”
The driver was a young man in his twenties. He looked very smart.
“Alright, Boss, let me introduce myself. My name is Zhang Qiang. You can call me Qiang Zi.”
Mo Xiu asked curiously, “Why are you calling me Boss?”
Qiang Zi started the car and looked at the rearview mirror. “I asked Young Master Liu. He said to call you Boss.”
“Liu Ziyang… Let’s set off. How long will it take to get there?”
Qiang Zi touched the steering wheel with both hands. A sense of confidence arose in him.
“Ten minutes. Sit tight.”
Ten minutes?
Mo Xiu was a little puzzled. He had checked the route before coming here. It would take at least 30 minutes from the train station to Yanjing University. Could it be that they were flying over in 10 minutes?
However, as soon as the car started, Mo Xiu understood. Although the car wasn’t flying, it was close.
Qiang Zi drove too quickly and was very agile. There were some traffic jams in Yanjing at this time, but Qiang Zi could always find a gap to pass through. Thus, this journey was smooth.
Ten minutes later — the journey really took exactly ten minutes — they arrived at the entrance of Yanjing University.
Qiang Zi was not only fast, but he was also very stable. Mo Xiu did not feel uncomfortable at such a fast speed.
This was not something a normal person could do. Out of curiosity, Mo Xiu activated God’s Eye on Qiang Zi.
“First Skill: Driving.”
“Skill Effect: When driving a car, all spiritual attributes of the user will be increased by 50%, and driving skills will be significantly improved.”
“Duration: Four hours.”
“Cooldown: One hour.”
“Second Skill: Mastery.”
“Skill: The user will master the use of all transportation tools and equipment. The user’s learning ability will also increase by 50%.”
“Duration: One hour.”
“Cooldown: Three hours.”
“Third Skill: Agility.”
“Skill Effect: Increases the user’s reaction speed by 50%.”
“Duration: 15 minutes.”
“Cooldown: 3 hours.”
After seeing Qiang Zi’s skills, Mo Xiu sighed. It seemed like the heavens wanted him to drive. This was too crazy.
Qiang Zi got off the car with Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu signaled Qiang Zi to go back.
However, Qiang Zi continued to follow Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu asked, “You don’t have to follow me. You can go back first.”
Qiang Zi said, “Boss, I live here.”
“You live here? Are you a student here too?”
Qiang Zi said proudly, “Yeah, I’m already in my third year of university. I’m a support major and work part-time in the Liu Corporation.”
Mo Xiu understood. It seemed as if Liu Ziyang had arranged this on purpose.
“Since you’re a student here, it’ll be easy. Bring me around.”
Normally, school would start tomorrow, but most students coming from other cities would choose to report a day earlier. This was the case for Mo Xiu.
There were too many people at the reporting area, so Mo Xiu wasn’t in a hurry. Instead, he let Qiang Zi bring him around and familiarize himself with the environment.
Slowly, Mo Xiu began to regret his decision. Yanjing University was really too big. It took them more than two hours to walk around it.
The school was divided into three large areas, namely the dormitory area, the martial arts area, and the office area.
After Qiang Zi’s introduction, Mo Xiu roughly understood the composition of Yanjing University.
There was nothing to say about the dormitory area. Students and teachers lived in one area. Students lived in ten of the buildings, while the teachers lived in one building that had a huge cafeteria.
The martial arts area was the largest area. There were a total of fifteen martial arts arenas, each with different uses. In comparison, there were only ten dormitories, which showed how much Yanjing University valued combat ability.
Lastly, the office area was made up of five buildings in total. One of them was a teaching building that was used for theory classes.
According to Qiang Zi, there were only one theory class per week, so there was only one building for such classes.
The remaining four buildings in the office area were reserved for the student union and the clubs. Every student organization could apply for a room for official uses.
When they returned to the reporting area, there were still many people there. Qiang Zi had left because he had something to do. Thus, Mo Xiu could only wait in line obediently.
Perhaps it was because the queue was too long and everyone was bored from waiting. The person in front of Mo Xiu went to talk to Mo Xiu.
“Hey, bro, which department are you going to enroll in? Since we’re queuing up together, if we enroll in the same department, we might be in the same dormitory.”
Mo Xiu asked curiously, “Doesn’t the school automatically allocate our majors?”
Upon hearing that Mo Xiu didn’t know about this, the man turned around and said, “Let me introduce myself, Hao Ren!”
“Ah? You’re a good
person
? I’m Mo Xiu.”
Hao Ren smiled and said, “That’s right. Not only am I called Hao Ren, but I’m also a good person. You don’t even know how to choose a major, so you must not have done your homework. Yanjing University is different from other universities. You can choose which department you want to go to.”
Mo Xiu really didn’t have time to prepare for university during this holiday.
“What if someone chooses blindly?”
Hao Ren’s interest was piqued. “If you want to choose blindly, no one will stop you. Some rich second-generation heirs choose majors with more girls.”
Mo Xiu humbly asked, “In that case, may I know what majors there are?”
Hao Ren held his hands in front of his chest and gestured as he said, “Yanjing University is different from other universities. Yanjing University is divided into five major departments.”
With that, Hao Ren held out five fingers and kept Mo Xiu in suspense.
Mo Xiu cooperatively asked, “What are the five major departments?”
Hao Ren gestured with his right hand and continued, “They are the Assault, Agility, Magic, Support and Esper Departments respectively. After you choose one of the five major departments, you will be immediately assigned to different classes. Take the Support Department for example. One class can have students with investigative and healing skills.”
After Hao Ren’s explanation, Mo Xiu had more or less understood the major departments in Yanjing University.
The five major departments coincided with Wang Yu’s Physique Limit Theory.
The Assault Department would be chosen by those who had a warrior physique, while the Agility Department would be chosen by those with an assassin physique. Meanwhile, students with a mage physique would choose the Magic Department. The Support Department would comprise of students with investigative, medical, and some other special physiques.
As for the Esper Department, it should house those with skills like Yue Yuan’s Five Elements Formation, as well as some special physiques.
Seeing Mo Xiu in deep thought, Hao Ren asked, “Mo Xiu, which department are you going to choose?”


“Hao Ren” sounds like “good person” in Chinese



                    



Chapter 41: If You ‘re Not Family, You Won I t Enter the Same Door

Moxiu was stunned for a moment before saying, “Power attack type. The other types might not be suitable for me. ‘”‘
Great!” Hao Ren said excitedly.” I’ll choose the power attack system too.
Maybe we can share the same dormitory. ‘”‘
Hao Ren was indeed a good person. He explained the entire process of queuing to Moxiu, and Moxiu was very grateful to him. In the end, they exchanged contact information.
Finally, it was MO Xiu’s turn. The registration area was in a very large classroom with five teachers sitting inside.
MO Xiu entered the classroom and sat in front of a free teacher.
The teacher’s gaze was fixed on the computer screen in front of her. She did not look up at MO Xiu. It seemed that she was a little tired after a day of work.
“Name!”
“MO Xiu!”
When the teacher heard MO Xiu’s name, he raised his head and looked at MO Xiu.
“You are MO Xiu?”
MO Xiu politely replied, “Yes, teacher.’”‘
“Aiya, I looked at the college entrance examination results. You’re very suitable to enter the power attack department.”
“I’ll consider it,” said Moxiu.”
“What’s there to consider? With your skills, which element can you enter if not the power attack system?”
MO Xiu had a confused look on his face, and the teacher was helpless. He took out a piece of paper and handed it to MO Xiu.
“Please fill out this form. After you fill it out, I will assign you a class and dormitory.”
MO Xiu took it and took a look.
” Name, contact details, chosen department, expertise.’
Don’t even think about taking a long time to write, making the teacher feel a little helpless. What was there to think about?
When the teacher saw MO Xiu’s registration form, his eyes almost fell out.
He looked at Moxiu in disbelief and said, “Mo Xiu, is there something wrong with your head? Are you sure you made the right choice?”
MO Xiu glanced at his report and said,””That’s right. Teacher, please help me enter it into the computer. It’s getting late. I still have to go back to the dormitory to clean up.”
The teacher looked at the report form and didn’t say anything for a long time. In the end, he sighed helplessly and entered MO Xiu’s information into the computer.
“The registration is complete. He is in Class 6, and his dorm is Dorm 312 of Dorm 9.”
Moxiu stood up and said to the teacher, “Thank you, teacher. I’m leaving.’”‘
The teacher waved his hand and whispered, “Young people nowadays are simply wasting their talent. ‘”‘
MO Xiu bumped into Hao Ren as soon as he stepped out of the door.
Seeing MO Xiu, Hao Ren immediately walked over and said,””Mo Xiu, which dormitory did you get assigned to? Are you in the same dormitory as me? I’m from Dormitory No. 2, Room 517.”
Hao Ren said in disbelief,” That’s not right. I heard from the teacher that the power attack system is in Building 1 and Building 2. How did you get No. 9?””
“Oh, I forgot to tell you. I suddenly changed my mind just now. I didn’t choose the power attack system.”
“Which one did you choose?” Hao Ren asked in confusion. Agility system?”
In Hao Rents mind, only the agility-type and the power-type were close. If Moxiu didn’t choose the power-type, he would definitely choose the agility-type.
Moxiu shook his head.” No, I chose the support system.’”‘
“What?” Hao Ren asked in shock.!! MO Xiu, are you crazy? Isn’t your skill an offensive skill? Why did you choose the support system?”
“Hehe, didn’t you say so?” MO Xiu laughed strangely. Some rich second-generation heirs like to go to a department with more girls. You also said that there are more girls in the support department.”
Wang Yu had also mentioned this before. Due to the limitations of their physiques, women’s physiques were more inclined towards support and spells, while men’s physiques were more inclined towards warriors and superpowers.
Hao Ren looked at Moxiu up and down and said in disbelief,””Are you a rich second-generation heir? Are you going for girls?”
“What?” MO Xiu smiled. Doesn’t it look like it?”
After saying that, Moxiu turned around and left, leaving Hao Ren with his mouth twitching.
“You really don’t know a person’s heart by his appearance. He looks like a talented person, but I didn’t expect him to be a lecherous person.”
Hao Ren said righteously. He turned around and whispered,””Sigh, I’m jealous. I want to be willful too.”
MO Xiu took his luggage to Building 9. Before he entered, he saw a girl coming out.
He quickly confirmed it. That’s right. This is Building 9. Why would there be a girl coming out?
She stood outside the door for a while and saw a boy coming out. She then went in at ease.
After entering, MO Xiu finally understood. How was this a dormitory? It was clearly an apartment. Every dormitory was independent, so men and women could live in the same building.
Moxiu first reported to the dormitory management office on the first floor. The gatekeeper was an old man who looked to be in his sixties.
He knocked on the door and went straight to the point. “Hello, I’m a new student reporting for the door key.”
Sir System glanced at MO Xiu and said, “Name!””
“My name is MO Xiu. I was assigned to Room 312.”
“I have the final say in this building. Let me tell you a few rules. First, the room must be clean. Although I won’t check the dormitory, I won’t let you off easily if you let me know whose room is messy.”
“Two, you are not allowed to fight anywhere in this building.”
“Third, this building is for men and women. Men and women are not allowed to live in the same bedroom. If you can’t stand it, go out and get a room.”
“Fourth, you have to report that you haven’t returned to the dormitory for a long time.”
After Sir System finished speaking, he handed a key card to Moxiu.
Moxiu took the key card and left silently when he saw that Sir System did not want to speak anymore.
He went up to the third floor and found Room 312. He used the key card to open the door. The moment he entered the room, he felt a familiar feeling.
The entire house was not big, but it was clean and simple. There was a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom, two bedrooms, and a balcony.
Overall, it looked somewhat similar to Moxiu’s old house.
The lights in the living room were on, so his roommate must have arrived before MO Xiu.
MO Xiu called out softly.
“Is anyone there?”
A person ran out from one of the bedrooms. He was shirtless and had a very strong body. He was a whole size bigger than Moxiu.
“I’m here, I’m here. Hello! My name is Dong Fang. You must be my roommate, right?”
After Dong Fang walked closer, MO Xiu realized that this fellow had developed too well. He was more than 1.9 meters tall, and his explosive muscles gave off a sense of oppression.
The last time he saw such a person, it should be Moxiu’s first opponent in the Underground Arena, the Bulldozer.
Although Dong Fang’s figure was frightening, he gave off an inconspicuous feeling. Perhaps it was because of his relatively ordinary appearance and honest voice?
MO Xiu extended his hand and shook Dong Fangwo’s hand.”Hello, my name is
MO Xiu. Are you also a support-type?”
What surprised MO Xiu the most was that Dong Fang looked like a student of the power attack system.
Dong Fang scratched his head awkwardly and said,””Actually, I could have applied for the power attack system, but my mom told me to find a wife in the university. In the end, after thinking about it, I still decided to apply for the support system.”
He didn’t expect that not only was MO Xiu a weirdo, but his roommate was also a weirdo.
MO Xiu suspected that the teacher at the registration office had deliberately divided the students. Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental that two students who were supposed to be power attack students had applied for the support system?
Actually, Moxiu’s true purpose for reporting to the Support System was to secretly research God’s Snooping.
After such a long period of experience, Moxiu knew that God’s Sight wasn’t as simple as it seemed.
In the Underground Arena, Xue Jin’s skill was unable to lock onto Moxiu, which meant that God’s Sight could not be detected.
MO Xiu raised his head and glanced at Dong Fang. It wasn’t like they were all family..


                    



Chapter 42: School Opening Ceremony

Dong Fang pointed to a bedroom and said,” I came here first. I didn’t know which bedroom to stay in, so I picked one randomly. Look, if you like my room, I’ll give it to you.””
MO Xiu waved his hand and said,” No need. I’ll stay in the other room. Have you eaten?” Let’s go out for a meal?”
“I’ve eaten. I have to sleep. I drove all night yesterday and was busy all day today. I’m a little tired. I’ll treat you to dinner after the opening ceremony tomorrow.”
Moxiu nodded and said,”Alright, you should rest first.’”‘
After saying that, she took her luggage back to her room and packed up.
Liu Ziyang had been calling MO Xiu.
“Boss, where did you go? Why didn’t I find you?” “I’m in Room 312 of Building 9.”
“No. 9 building?” Liu Ziyang exclaimed. Support-type?”
“That’s right.”
“Boss, are you crazy? With your strength, you are the leader of the power attack system. Why would you go to the support system?”
Moxiu found an excuse and said,” In terms of actual combat, Teacher Wang Lei and Teacher Wang Yu have taught me more or less. I want to understand some support skills.””
” Tsk, boss, you’re bad. This is not true. You’re not going to the support system for a girl, right?” Oh my god, Mu Qingyi just left, and you’re already looking for another family?”
MO Xiu couldn’t be bothered with him and said,” Come and find me. Let’s go out for a meal.”
After hanging up the phone, Liu Ziyang quickly found MO Xiu. The two of them went to the cafeteria together.
It was six o’clock in the evening. Due to the large number of new students today, the huge canteen was a little crowded.
Moxiu searched for a long time before finding an empty seat for two.
Liu Ziyang said,” There are too many people here. I’m going to buy something to eat. Why don’t you reserve a seat here?”
MO Xiu nodded in agreement. He took advantage of the time Liu Ziyang left to look around.
He noticed a girl in a fiery red dress sitting at the table next to him. The more he looked at her, the stranger he felt.
This girl’s dress was completely out of place with the others. The style of her red dress was very similar to Han clothes. Her facial features were exquisite and could be considered a first-class beauty, but no one came over to talk to her. No one even dared to share a table.
The girl seemed to have noticed Moxiu peeking at her. She suddenly turned her head to look at Moxiu. Her gaze was like a sharp blade.
Moxiu secretly thought that this person was not to be trifled with. However, it was not easy to avoid being discovered, so he could only smile back.
The girl in red seemed to have sensed that Moxiu didn’t have any ill intentions. After giving him a warning look, she continued eating.
MO Xiu didn’t look at her anymore. It was already very unreasonable to stare at a girl, and now that he was discovered, he was naturally embarrassed to look at her again.
Liu Ziyang came back with a plate of dishes and said excitedly, “Boss, I didn’t expect the dishes here to be so good.”
MO Xiu took a look. There were a total of four dishes, and they all looked pretty good.
The two of them were about to start eating. Moxiu picked up his chopsticks and was about to add more food when a hand appeared and hit Moxiu’s elbow.
MO Xiu was caught off guard. He threw his chopsticks on the ground and looked up. Three men were looking at MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang with dissatisfaction.
Liu Ziyang immediately got angry. He slammed the table and stood up. “What do you mean? Are you looking for trouble?”
The leader of the three said,”This is our seat. Hurry up and make way. We’re going to eat.””
Moxiu bent down to pick up the chopsticks that had fallen to the ground and placed them on the table. He turned his head to look at the three of them. “We’re already eating here. Why do you say that this seat is yours?”
“Because I ate here yesterday, so this seat is mine.””
‘ Then I’ll be eating here today,” Moxiu said.” From now on, this seat will be mine. You didn’t manage to keep an eye on it, so I’m sorry.’”‘
That person stretched out his hand and grabbed towards MO Xiu. MO Xiu
leaned back and dodged, but that person missed and grabbed at him with his other hand.
Moxiu grabbed his hand and pulled him down, causing him to fall to the ground.
The person laughed after falling down. He got up and said to Moxiu,”Kid, you’re hitting people in the canteen. Are you tired of living? I’m in pain all over. If you don’t pay, I’ll report it to the school. If you fight in the cafeteria, you’ll be suspended or expelled.”
MO Xiu’s brows were tightly knitted together. It seemed like this group of people was deliberately finding fault with him just to extort money.
“I didn’t expect that even Yanjing University would have a scum like you.” That person did not want to be outdone. He directly lay on the ground and shouted.
‘ Aiya, beating someone up! A new student who just arrived is already beating someone up! Is there anyone who can stop me?!”‘
The two people who came with this person also cooperated very well. One of them went up to help him, while the other pointed at Moxiu and shouted,”That’s right. I saw it clearly just now. It was this person who hit him.”
MO Xiu sighed softly. What was going on? She didn’t want to come over for a meal, so she looked up at Liu Ziyang and let him settle it.
Liu Ziyang was originally watching the show with a smile. These people were really interesting. When he saw MO Xiu looking over, he immediately understood that they wanted him to deal with them.
Before Liu Ziyang could pick up the phone, a cold and emotionless female voice was heard.
“Get lost! ”
The three people who were acting immediately got up from the ground and looked around to find the source of the voice.
In the end, everyone’s gaze was locked onto the red-dressed girl.
When the three of them saw the girl, they were shocked and immediately walked over to bow and apologize.
“Sister Xiao Hong, I didn’t know you were here. Sorry for disturbing your meal.”
Xiao Hong glanced at MO Xiu and said to them,””Didn’t you hear what I said just now?”
“Get lost, get lost!”
The three of them ran quickly and disappeared in a moment.
MO Xiu didn’t expect this red-robed woman named Xiao Hong to be so awesome. He was glad that he didn’t offend her.
Since he had helped, he naturally had to thank him. MO Xiu stood up and wanted to go over, but he was pulled back by Liu Ziyang.
MO Xiu didn’t understand, but he still sat down opposite Xiao Hong.
“Thank you for your help just now.”
Seeing MO Xiu sit down, Xiao Hong frowned slightly. She was clearly unhappy and placed her chopsticks on the table. It seemed like she wouldn’t eat anymore.
Xiao Hong ignored MO Xiu and stood up to say to Liu Ziyang,’”‘Liu Ziyang, is this your boss? You have the same bad taste as your father.”
After saying that, he turned around and left. MO Xiu sat back down awkwardly.
“What happened? You know him?”
Liu Ziyang said helplessly,” Boss, don’t ask about this. I can’t even afford to offend her. If you meet her in the future, just hide if you can.”
MO Xiu curiously looked in the direction Xiao Hong had left. What kind of place was Yanjing University? What kind of place was Yanjing?
The two of them were not in the mood to do such a thing. They hurriedly ate and went back to the dormitory to sleep.
The next morning, MO Xiu didn’t look for Liu Ziyang. The two of them weren’t from the same faculty, and the opening ceremony wasn’t arranged for them to sit together.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang went out together. After breakfast, the two of them headed straight for the first training field. The opening ceremony was held there.
MO Xiu looked very petite when he walked with Dong Fang, and the number of people who turned their heads along the way was not low.
Upon entering the first training field, MO Xiu was stunned. Wasn’t this too exaggerated?
This stadium was the largest in the world. There was nothing inside except for the middle area and countless chairs around it.
According to the data given by the teacher yesterday, MO Xiu and Dong Fang came to the designated area of the Support Department and sat down.
It didn’t take long for people to arrive one after another, filling up the entire martial arts field.
With a resounding voice, Moxiu’s university life began.
“The opening ceremony officially begins!”


                    



Chapter 43: Support

“The opening ceremony has officially begun. First, let’s introduce the history of Yanjing University. Our school was the first school to reopen after the war. Our school…
Moxiu thought that the opening ceremony would talk about some very important things, but it was actually just an introduction of the school’s history and some of the school’s rules. There was nothing else.
In summary, there were the following points:
Firstly, the school’s education method was relatively free, and there was a lot of free training time.
Second, the school’s education competition was mainly based on theory.
Third, the school encouraged duels and challenges, but it was forbidden for seniors to challenge juniors unless they had permission from the juniors.
Fourth, look for the form teacher if there’s anything.
There were only a few rules in total. The first one said that you needed to work hard on your own. The second one meant that the education was completely based on actual combat. The third one was to protect the lower grade students. After all, one more skill meant that they would be stronger.
The opening ceremony ended in less than two hours. After it ended, every class began to gather.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang were both from Class 6. The two of them came to a field in the No. 3 training ground.
A lazy man sat at the front. Seeing that almost everyone had arrived, he shouted,” Support class six, gather!”
MO Xiu took a rough look. There were a total of 50 people in Class Six. Indeed, there were more girls, accounting for about three-quarters of the entire class.
“My name is Cao Fenglin, I’m your class teacher. You heard what I said at the opening ceremony. The education of Yanjing University is based on competition. The entire university life is a competition.”
“Cough cough! The types of competitions were divided into individual battles and team battles. Sometimes, a pair battle would be added.”
“There are two organizers for the competition. The first is the school’s official competition. It’s held once every school year and is divided into class battles, department selection battles, school selection battles, and national battles.”
“The second is the student council’s group battle. It will be held within the school. If you want to improve your combat ability, it is recommended to join a group. Because our support system is the weakest in the school, but we are popular in the group. If you want to get good results and represent the school, you have to practice more.”
“Next, I’ll talk about the advancement method. Two people will form a group for the inter-class battle. The first two groups will advance to the selection battle of the faculty.”
“The class selection will begin now. Do you have any questions? Good! If not, then let’s start, huff!”
He recited the entire competition as if he was reading a script. After he finished, he even let out a long sigh as if he was finally relieved.
MO Xiu didn’t expect Cao Fenglin to be so perfunctory. This was a teacher from Yanjing University, but why did he feel that he was inferior to his high school form teacher, Gao Quan?
After Cao Fenglin finished speaking, he sat down at the side. After a while, he realized that none of his classmates had moved.
“Why aren’t you guys starting?
A short-haired girl standing at the front of the class said, “Teacher, how are we going to compete? Also, how do we group them?”
Cao Fenglin narrowed his eyes and said impatiently,””What’s your name?”
“My name is Mu Mu,” the short-haired girl said.”
“Alright, you are the class monitor now. You will organize the competition and divide the groups according to the dormitory. Each dormitory will form a team.”
MO Xiu and Dong Fang looked at each other. Wasn’t this teacher too casual? Was this really the best school?
Mu Mu was also a little helpless, so he could only brace himself and organize the group.
There was no way he could do that. The cooldown time of a level 1 skill was three hours, and there were less than two hours before lunch.
In other words, most people could only use their skills in the first match. The cooldown for the rest of the match had not ended yet, so they could not use them again.
Mu Mu asked everyone to divide into groups and then said,””Does anyone have any suggestions? Is there any way to choose the two strongest groups within two hours?”
Everyone fell silent. Only one battle could be fought. How could they determine which two teams were the strongest? How can we be fair?
Even if the fastest elimination round was used, there would be a total of 50 people and 25 teams. After the first round, there would be 13 teams left. Most people would not be able to continue using their skills in the remaining matches. It was simply unfair.
MO Xiu looked at the silent crowd and stood up.
“Actually, everyone is thinking too complicated. It’s fairest to only have one match, so let’s just have one.”
Mu Mu frowned and said, “It’s easy to say, but there’s only one match. How can we choose two?” Could it be…
MO Xiu walked to the front.” That’s right. It seems like the class monitor has already thought it through. There’s only one answer. It’s a battle royale. The last two teams will be the winners.”
Everyone started discussing this idea. Cao Fenglin also glanced at MO Xiu.
From the moment Moxiu thought things through, he knew that Cao Fenglin wasn’t simple.
The students had to think of their own ways. In the end, this was the only way.
The free-for-all might not be fair to the other Elements, but this was the Support Element. It was very difficult for the Support Element to be fair.
On one hand, it was difficult to group them. If two people were in a group, who knew if these two people were pure healers? Without attack-type students, the support-type students would not be able to display their full strength.
On the other hand, it was also unfair to have two people in a group. This way, only the two groups with the strongest combat ability would be selected, and not the people with the most practical support skills.
Therefore, the battle royals in the support system were the fairest. It tested the students ‘combat ability and the support’s ability to adapt. When should they support whom?
After everyone unanimously agreed, Mu Mu announced that they would use MO Xiu’s method, a battle royale!
“Since no one has any objections, shall we begin the competition?” Mu Mu said.”
“I have an objection!” Moxiu raised his hand and said.”
Mu Mu was stunned. What was going on? Weren’t you the one who suggested the free-for-all? Why do you have objections now?
“What’s your problem?” Mu Mu asked in confusion.”
MO Xiu looked at Cao Fenglin and said,” Teacher, I have a suggestion. I don’t
Imow if I can say it!””
Cao Fenglin still looked lazy as he said,””Speak! What suggestion?” “I don’t think it’s fair for each dormitory to have one group.
what do you think is the fairest?”
“Is the purpose of the class selection to choose two teams of four?” asked MO
Xiu. ”
Cao Fenglin nodded.” That’s right. There are four of them.”‘
MO Xiu smiled and said,”Then why don’t you give me something more exciting?” We won’t split into groups and fight on our own. The last four people will win. How about it?”
Cao Fenglin’s interest was piqued when he heard MO Xiu’s words. He stood up and walked towards MO Xiu.
“Good, good! You’re interesting, kid. I like you. Let’s advance according to what you said. There’s no need to divide into teams. Everyone will fight for themselves. The last four people will come!”
It was fairest for everyone to fight for themselves. This was especially important for judging the situation on the field.
As soon as the match began, everyone was an enemy, and at the same time, everyone could be teammates.
Whether they were friend or foe was entirely up to them. In a battle between two people, it was entirely up to them to decide who to buff.
This was also the most important thing for support-type people, other than the strength of their skills, their judgment and adaptability!
A good Support might not be the leader, but they were definitely the ones who could judge the situation.
Cao Fenglin’s interest was piqued.. He stood at the side of the arena and shouted,””Competition…Begin!”


                    



Chapter 44: Controlling the Situation

“Let the competition begin!”
As Cao Fenglin’s voice faded, the competition officially began.
At the start of the match, everyone took a step back and did not rush to attack. They wanted to see the situation on the field.
For a moment, no one made a move. The arena was in a deadlock because everyone knew in their hearts that whoever made the first move at this time would be the target of everyone.
The silence didn’t last long before it was broken by a bespectacled girl.
She did not make a move. Instead, she pointed at Moxiu and said, “Everyone, listen to me. He’s from Shun City like me. He’s the top scorer of the college entrance examination, and his skills are very likely to be extremely aggressive.”
Moxiu widened his eyes as he looked at this girl. He had no impression of her at all. This way, Moxiu would have no way to quibble. Everyone would definitely attack her together. He didn’t expect to shoot himself in the foot.
As expected, after hearing the girl’s words, everyone hesitated for a second before attacking Moxiu together.
Moxiu had no choice but to activate the Descent of the Martial God. His entire body flashed with golden light as he quickly flashed to the other side of the arena.
At this time, he could not be careless. The people here were all support skills. If all these skills were added to one person, the skills would be ever-changing. He might not be a match for them.
MO Xiu slowed down and started to face the enemy head-on. After two moves, he discovered that the people in front of him had skills, but there was no situation where many skills were stacked on one person.
After thinking about it for a while, he understood that although he was the public enemy now, even if he was eliminated, the others would still continue to fight for the rest of the time. No one wanted to make a wedding dress for others.
Those who could cast support skills on themselves would definitely do so on themselves. If they could not, they would definitely buff each other or cast them on people who were not in a state. After all, no one wanted to create a powerful enemy.
This way, the pressure on Moxiu was greatly reduced. With the buff of the War God’s Descent, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to fight against these support-type people.
However, Support players generally had very strong physiques because they did not have strong self-defense abilities. They could only use their own speed and strength to fight against the enemy.
Those who could enter Yanjing University were definitely outstanding, so their combat strength was much stronger than ordinary people. MO Xiu didn’t have it easy either.
Moxiu frowned. Even if he was much stronger than the others, there were simply too many people on the other side. There were already more than 30 people who had joined the battle.
Fortunately, these people weren’t sincere in their cooperation. Occasionally, some of them would be ambushed, and the battle behind them would become chaotic, reducing some of the pressure on Moxiu.
Just as Moxiu was feeling vexed, the situation on the field changed. Six people suddenly helped Moxiu fight against the others.
MO Xiu took a closer look. It was Dong Fang, the class monitor Mu Mu, and three women and a man. MO Xiu didn’t recognize them.
At this point, the situation on the battlefield became clear. There were only two factions.
Moxiu’s side had seven people, while the other side had thirty-eight people. Eleven people were eliminated.
Cao Fenglin was very satisfied with the battle and nodded his head slightly.
Of course, the person who helped MO Xiu wasn’t looking at MO Xiu pitifully.
It was because they were stronger than the others. After the others defeated Moxiu, they would definitely join forces to attack them. They had no choice but to help Moxiu and form a temporary alliance.
The girl who had just pointed out MO Xiu said,”Students who haven’t used any skills, give me all your amplification skills. I’ll deal with Moxiu, and you guys deal with the others.”
As soon as this girl said this, many people added their skills to her. It was not because she was trustworthy, but because the benefits and risks were proportional. Although she received more skills, she would face the strongest Moxiu.
The match entered a white-hot stage. The battle on the field was extremely intense, and there were players who were eliminated at any time. The bespectacled girl had indeed exchanged blows with Moxiu, but after only two moves, she felt that she was unable to defeat Moxiu and retreated.
From this moment on, Moxiu began to slaughter in all directions. With six helpers, Moxiu could harvest as much as he wanted.
There was another person who was invincible in the crowd, and that was Dong Fang. Dong Fang’s skill was very strange. After he released it, his entire body turned golden. It seemed that it had increased his defense and attack power.
Moxiu had originally wanted to take the bait in the middle of the scuffle before attacking. He did not expect that because of the bespectacled girl’s report, he would have to fight with all his might from the start.
However, there was also an advantage to this, which was that he had learned more strange skills.
Moxiu had personally seen a person making strange movements like rubber. This should have increased his flexibility by a lot.
There were also those who immediately recovered and continued fighting after being knocked down and injured.
There was also a girl called He Lingyue on MO Xiu’s side. Her attack power was average, but her speed and agility were insane.
Moxiu believed that his speed was definitely faster than hers, but her agility was too terrifying. It was as if she knew what her opponent was going to do next and dodged in advance. She was not hit even once in the chaotic battle.
As time passed, the number of people on the stage decreased, and the elimination rate increased.
The bespectacled girl started by testing MO Xiu, then she started to fish in troubled waters in the middle, and then she started to attack the weakest student in the later stages.
“You… I just increased your speed. You can’t eliminate me. You said that you would deal with Moxiu.”
” This is a solo battle,” the girl said.” There’s no real alliance. If I can’t beat him, do I have to die?’”‘ ‘You…”
“I’m sorry.”
As the bespectacled girl switched sides, the main force did not have any top-notch combat strength and was quickly defeated.
Two minutes later, there were only five people left on the field.
MO Xiu, Dong Fang, Mu Mu, He Lingyue, and the bespectacled girl.
With one more person eliminated, the remaining four people would advance. At this moment, the five people stopped and looked at each other.
Moxiu was the most relaxed. He walked to the side of the arena and sat down, looking at the other four.
At this moment, the bespectacled girl said,” The current situation is very obvious. Moxiu is the strongest here. We just need to join forces to defeat him and we can advance. With the strength of the four of us, there shouldn’t be any problem.”
MO Xiu looked at the bespectacled girl carefully. What kind of grudge did this person have against him? From the beginning to the end, he had been targeting him.
Moxiu looked at the time and said,”Hurry up and end the match as soon as possible. ‘”‘
Dong Fang, Mu Mu, and He Lingyue looked at each other.
Mu Mu said to the bespectacled girl,” Alright, we agree. However, you betrayed us before. We can’t trust you completely. You’ll take the lead. We’ll take down Moxiu together.’”‘
The bespectacled girl was very satisfied with this answer. It seemed that the situation had been turned around this time.
The bespectacled girl nodded and ran towards Moxiu. The other three followed closely behind.
MO Xiu didn’t move. He remained seated on the spot, looking rather lazy. “Moxiu, you’re done for!” The bespectacled girl shouted.”
Before he could finish his sentence, the three people behind him attacked together. They did not attack Moxiu, but the bespectacled girl. They quickly knocked her to the ground.
At this moment, Cao Fenglin said, ” The name list for the advancement is out. The four of them are MO Xiu, Dong Fang, Mu Mu, and He Lingyue.””
The bespectacled girl said to Moxiu in disbelief, “What happened? You knew that the three of them would attack me? Are they your people?”
MO Xiu smiled as he stood up and walked to the center of the arena.
“There are a total of five people on the stage. As long as one of them is eliminated, the others will advance. Then, who would choose to fight the strongest one? When you said that you wanted to join forces to defeat the both of us, you had already lost!”
“You think that you have the hearts of the people and control the situation, but in fact, you are too involved to see!”


                    



Chapter 45: Encyclopedia Hao Ren

The bespectacled girl was stunned by MO Xiu’s words. However, not long after, she started shouting at Cao Fenglin again.
“Teacher, I don’t agree with the results of this competition. MO Xiu and Dong
Fang are not support skills at all.”
“It’s a waste of time talking to people like you.” MO Xiu sighed.”
The bespectacled girl glared fiercely at MO Xiu.
Cao Fenglin had a serious expression on his face.” This student, did you not hear the rules I explained at the beginning?” The remaining four people would be the ones who advanced!”
Seeing that the teacher was a little angry, the bespectacled girl stopped talking.
Cao Fenglin gathered everyone and said,””The class selection has ended, and the names of the four who have advanced have been confirmed. From now on, there will be no classes for the next half a month.”
“Teacher, does that mean that those of us who didn’t advance have no chance?” asked another student.”
This student asked what everyone was thinking. If it was decided on the first day that they could not participate in the competition this semester, wouldn’t it be a little too cruel?
“Didn’t you guys hear what they said at the opening ceremony?” Cao Fenglin asked. Yanjing University’s education was based on competition. Everyone had a chance.”
“There will be a class competition every month. The four winners can challenge the students who have already advanced. If they win, they can replace the students who have advanced.”
“Due to the special circumstances of our support system, some students with outstanding skills may be directly selected by the teachers to advance. Everyone, don’t relax. Everyone has a chance, and at the same time, everyone may fall behind.”
After hearing this, MO Xiu couldn’t help but sigh at the teaching methods of Yanjing University.
It seemed like there were no restrictions, but in reality, there was competition everywhere, making it impossible for people to relax for a moment.
Cao Fenglin continued,” Half a month later, the four who have advanced will go to the faculty for the selection. The rest will come here for the inter-class competition. Alright, you are dismissed!’”‘
For most people, their college life began in such a cruel way.
“MO Xiu, wait!”
Cao Fenglin called out to MO Xiu. MO Xiu told Dong Fang to go eat first and stayed behind alone.
“Teacher, why are you looking for me?”
Cao Fenglin looked at his phone and said, “You’re the top scorer of this year’s college entrance examination?””
“Yes, Teacher.” MO Xiu nodded.”
“With your skills, you would be the best in the power attack system. Why did you choose the support system?”
“For women! ” “Nonsense!” “To relax!”
“Nonsense!”
“I chose it randomlv!”
“Nonsense! A commoner kid who got into Yanjing University through hard work. Why would he choose randomly?”
Moxiu shook his head helplessly and said seriously,””l want to form a team!”
Cao Fenglin’s eyes widened. What kind of team?”
MO Xiu puffed out his chest and said word by word,””An invincible team, a team that can sweep away everything in the world.”
Cao Fenglin narrowed his eyes and didn’t say anything.
MO Xiu thought that Cao Fenglin still had doubts and continued,””Because of this reason, I chose the support system. The support of a team is especially important. I also want to learn how to support thinking and be an outstanding leader!”
Cao Fenglin waved his hand and said,” Alright, I understand. You may leave.’”‘
Moxiu walked out of the No. 3 training ground and felt relieved. He could finally relax now. This reason was enough to dispel the doubts of others.
Actually, what Moxiu had said just now was not completely fabricated. Moxiu had thought about all these things. While he could make friends with more people, he could also train himself.
“Ring, ring, ring…”
The phone rang and MO Xiu picked it up. It was Liu Ziyang.
“Boss, where are you? Have you eaten? I just finished class. Let’s have a meal together?”
MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang had agreed to meet in the cafeteria. This time, there weren’t that many people in the cafeteria, so the two of them randomly found a seat and sat down.
“Boss, isn’t Yanjing University too tiring?” Liu Ziyang said with a tired face.” “Tired? Where are you tired?”
“There are 60 students in our class, and we’re going to have the inter-class competition,” Liu Ziyang said weakly.”
“Me too. I’ve already chosen the list of people who will advance to the next round.”
“What? How? Why so fast?”
“In the free-for-all, the last four people have advanced.”
Liu Ziyang raised his thumb and nodded repeatedly.”Awesome, we need to fight for half a month to confirm the advancement list.”
“A round every day?”
“Yes, I am!”
“It won’t take more than half a month, right?”
“In the remaining days, the losers will challenge each other. Only the four winners can defend the arena to advance.”
The image of Cao Fenglin’s lazy appearance appeared in MO Xiu’s mind. It seemed like it had something to do with the form teacher. The reason why class six’s selection method was so simple was definitely because Cao Fenglin had made his own decisions.
When MO Xiu found out that the entire school’s class had the same idea of the same thing as Liu Ziyang’s, he instantly felt like he had been cheated. How did he end up with such a class teacher?
“Boss, the club is recruiting this afternoon. Which club are you going to join?” Liu Ziyang asked MO Xiu.”
MO Xiu looked at Liu Ziyang and then held his head. This Cao Fenglin didn’t even mention the club’s recruitment.
“I don’t know either. What clubs are there?”
Liu Ziyang quickly ate the rice in his bowl and stood up.”l’m not sure either. Shall we go and take a look now?”
MO Xiu was also a little curious about the club. The main reason was that for the next half a month, everyone else would be in the class selection competition. He had nothing to do.
The two of them came to the front of the teaching building, which was now surrounded by people.
MO Xiu squeezed his way in with much difficulty. He realized that there were rows of tables and chairs inside, and there was a person sitting in front of each table. It was probably the club’s recruitment registration office.
Looking around, MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang had no clue. They were a little dizzy from looking at the various clubs.
At this moment, a familiar figure appeared in front of Moxiu and walked past him.
MO Xiu’s eyes were sharp and his hands were fast as he grabbed the ball.
“Hao Ren, what a coincidence!”
Seeing that it was MO Xiu, Hao Ren said excitedly,””Mo Xiu? I’ve asked around. You’re actually the top scorer of the college entrance examination, and you’ve easily obtained the qualifications to enter the internal department selection.” “You’re quite well-informed, aren’t you?” Moxiu was stunned for a moment.”
Hao Ren raised his right thumb and pointed at himself.””Of course. I’m famous,
Hao Ren from the Encyclopedia.”
Halfway through his sentence, he saw Liu Ziyang beside MO Xiu and asked,””And this is?”
MO Xiu glanced at Liu Ziyang and said, “This is my friend, Liu Ziyang.”” “Hiss! But the son of the Liu Corporation, Liu Ziyang?”
Liu Ziyang smiled and said, “It’s really an encyclopedia. Even I know about it.””
Hao Ren quickly shook hands with Liu Yang and said,””Of course. A small character like me has to know who not to mess with in Yanjing University.
You’re one of them.”
Liu Ziyang said proudly,” Of course, but you look good. If there’s anything in the future, just tell me.””
Hao Ren was overjoyed and shook his hand again.””Thank you, Young Master
Liu, for taking care of me,”
Then, he said to Moxiu,”You two are here to join the club, right?” MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang nodded together.
Hao Ren looked at the time and said,” Let me introduce you guys.” This was MO Xiu’s goal. He immediately said, “That’s exactly what I want..”


                    



Chapter 46: The Strongest Club

Hao Ren didn’t mind and said,””What kind of club do you want to join?”
“Liu Ziyang and I don’t really know what kind of clubs there are.’”‘
“Hmm… There were three main types of clubs. The first type was a restricted club with certain recruitment restrictions. For example, it only recruited students from the power attack department.”
“The second type is a hodgepodge club. As long as you are strong enough, you can join. The team formed by such a club is more balanced, and it is also the club with the largest number.”
“The third type of club is a local club. For example, if you come from Shun City, there is a Shun City club.”
“Then the strongest one should be a hodgepodge club, right?’”‘
Hao Ren shook his hand.” Not necessarily. There are six clubs in our school, and four of them are restricted clubs.’”‘
“Six clubs?” Liu Ziyang asked. What are there?”
“Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Yanjing, and
Chenxi. These six clubs have always been the strongest in Yanjing University.”
“Among them, the Four Divine Beasts Society is a single-attribute society.
Azure Dragon only recruits males, Vermillion Bird only recruits females, White Tiger only recruits agility-type students, and Black Tortoise only recruits assault-type students.”
“The Yanjing Club represents the strength of Yanjing. There are countless masters in it. Finally, there is Chenxi. Chenxi is known as the Dawn of Yanjing University. They are also top existences.”
MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang more or less understood. This club seemed to be messy, but in reality, there were so many divisions.
Hao Ren continued,” With your strength, I suggest you join the six major clubs.
First, you can train yourself. Second, you can make a name for yourself.” “Does the club restrict freedom?” asked MO Xiu.’
Hao Ren replied,” No, but there will be a tryout near the competition. It’s more troublesome. Although the official competition time is staggered with the school’s official competition time, most people who advance in both the school competition and the club competition will give up one of them.”
MO Xiu also started to think. If the official competition was staggered, then the time of the club selection would definitely clash with the school’s official competition. Therefore, most people would focus on one side. What should they do?
Don’t even think about participating in as many competitions as possible instead of wasting time on the qualifiers.
Liu Ziyang sneakily asked Hao Ren,””Are men really not allowed in the
Vermilion Bird Club?”
“I didn’t expect Brother Liu to…” Hao Ren asked with a strange smile. Ahem, I’m afraid not. The Vermilion Bird Club doesn’t accept any boys. You should apply for the support system like MO Xiu.”
Liu Ziyang tidied his clothes and pretended to be profound.”Hao Ren, I was just joking. Do you think a man like me would lack women?”
Hao Ren gave her a thumbs up and said that she was awesome.
After that, Liu Ziyang went around alone and returned five minutes later with a head full of sweat.
“What’s wrong?” asked MO Xiu. Who was chasing after him?
Liu Ziyang said with lingering fear,” Don’t mention it. I was just about to go for a walk. When I walked to the Vermilion Bird Club’s registration office, I saw Xiao Hong. Fortunately, I ran fast. Otherwise, I might have died there.””
Hao Ren widened his eyes and cupped his fists in admiration.””lmpressive, impressive. Brother Liu is indeed a big shot. You even have connections with people like Xiao Hong.”
MO Xiu looked at Hao Ren and thought,” Isn’t this flattery too much?
At this moment, Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren both looked at MO Xiu, waiting for his decision on which club to join.
Hao Ren felt that he had nothing to do with this and was ready to leave.
“Um, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving. I’ll contact you later.” MO Xiu suddenly came back to his senses and stopped Hao Ren.
“Wait a minute, Brother Hao Ren, I still have something to ask.”
Hahaha!” Hao Ren laughed heartily.” Ask me anything. I’ll tell you everything I know.””
“How do I create a club? Can I create it now that I’m a freshman?”
Hao Ren was surprised and quickly said,””Mo Xiu, with your strength, why did you create your own club? Now that the clubs in Yanjing University were basically stable, there was no room for new clubs to develop. Only those who couldn’t enter the top clubs and were unwilling to join other clubs would create clubs.”
“Oh?” MO Xiu asked. Are these people’s clubs not developing well?”
Of course not, good, bad, too many problems, one, can’t recruit people, two, there are too few people in the club after recruiting people, no competition.”
MO Xiu clapped his hands and said,” That’s great. I want a club like this. Tell me quickly. how do you create a club?””
Hao Ren looked at Moxiu as if he was an idiot. This guy was too weird. The top scorer of offensive skills joined the support class, and he could choose any club he wanted. However, he created a useless club himself.
“The building next to the teaching building. The first floor is the student union.
There is a club management office.”
MO Xiu held his chin as he pondered. Five people? She suddenly looked up at
Hao Ren.
“Brother Hao Ren, do you have a club now?” Hao Ren took two steps back.
Student Union, Club Management Office.
At this moment, a staff member was receiving MO Xiu. “Have you thought it through? Create a club?”
“I’ve thought about it,” Moxiu replied.
The staff member looked at the four people behind Moxiu who had not spoken and said,”Are you all willing?
They were Liu Ziyang, Hao Ren, Dong Fang, and He Lingyue.
This was almost everyone that MO Xiu knew in university. He had wanted to invite class monitor Mu Mu, but when he found Mu Mu, she had already joined the Vermilion Bird Club.
“I’ll ask you again. Are you guys willing?”
Seeing that the four of them did not answer, MO Xiu lightly coughed a few times.
“Cough, cough, cough!”
Liu Ziyang had no choice but to say,””Yes, I volunteered.”
Seeing Liu Ziyang express his stance, the others followed suit.
The staff always felt that this group of people was strange, but it didn’t matter. After all, this kind of club would usually disband within a month.
“Are there any requirements for joining the club?”
MO Xiu replied,”No!”
“What is the name of the club?”
MO Xiu scratched his head. He really hadn’t thought about this. He turned around and looked at the four of them. The four of them had the look of ‘you decide.’
MO Xiu was overwhelmed. What kind of name should he come up with? He couldn’t be too casual and too high-profile.
At this moment, MO Xiu’s phone rang. It was Zheng Yi.
He thought to himself, Zheng Yi, this kid, has come at the right time. This kid has many ideas.
” Wait a moment,” Moxiu said to the staff.” I’ll take this call and ask my friend for his opinion. I’ll get back to you immediately.’”‘
The staff was getting impatient. It was so difficult for these five people to create a club for fun.
“Zheng Yi, your call came at the right time.”
Zheng Yi casually said,” You’re too busy. You don’t know how to call me and ask me how I’m doing. What’s the matter?’”‘
“I want to create a club. What do you think it should be called?”
Zheng Yi said excitedly,” F * ck, that’s awesome. He even created a club. Let me think…” I got it!” What?!”
Strongest Club!”
MO Xiu thought he had heard wrongly and repeated himself.
“What? The strongest club?”
The staff member at the side quickly filled out the declaration form and said to the few of them,”Alright, the club has been successfully created. There are no recruitment restrictions. Strongest Club, Club Number: 666!”
The few of them looked at each other. Wasn’t this too ridiculous? “Moxiu, can I still quit now?” Hao Ren raised his hand and asked..”


                    



Chapter 47: New Mission

“Hello?” Zheng Yi called out over the phone. Hello? MO Xiu? Why aren’t you talking?”
MO Xiu and the others walked out of the management office before sighing and saying to Zheng Yi,’”‘l’ll hang up first. You’re really my good brother.”
“Of course, between the two of us…”
“Beep! Beep! Beep!”
After MO Xiu hung up, he said to Liu Ziyang and the others,”l’m sorry for the accident, but the club has been established, so this is the only way.”
Hao Ren, Liu Ziyang, and Dong Fang all looked bitter and reluctant.
Only He Lingyue, who MO Xiu was not familiar with, spoke up for MO Xiu.
“Actually…l think the strongest club is not that bad. It’s still acceptable.”
MO Xiu pointed at He Lingyue and praised, “”Look, you three old masters, look at how enlightened he is. This is called enlightenment. If he can accept it, why can’t you?”
Liu Ziyang still felt very uncomfortable.” Boss, I don’t think this name is bad.
It’s just that this name is too pretentious. It’s easy to become a target for others. ‘”‘
“Hey, why did we create this club?” Moxiu said earnestly. What do you think it’s
MO Xiu pointed at Hao Ren, signaling him to answer.
“To prove yourself?” Hao Ren asked.”
MO Xiu nodded his head affirmatively.” Sigh, that’s the point. Why did we come to Yanjing University?” You need to become stronger in order to grow faster under pressure. Liu Ziyang, you’re still not aware enough.”
After Moxiu finished speaking, he walked forward by himself. After this persuasion, everyone reluctantly accepted the fact that they were the strongest club.
Confused, Hao Ren asked Liu Ziyang,””Sigh, why do I feel that MO Xiu is different from usual? How could someone with such high awareness enter the support system?”
Liu Ziyang shook his head and said, “Mo Xiu calls himself MO Yingdi. His acting skills are definitely first-class.
As they spoke, they caught up with MO Xiu.
“MO Xiu, since our goal is to become stronger faster, should we start training tomorrow?” Dong Fang asked.”
MO Xiu had never thought about training before. He wanted to complete a mission during these fifteen days of free time. Dong Fang’s sudden question caused him to be at a loss for an answer.
Seeing that MO Xiu didn’t answer, Hao Ren interrupted,””Hey, Brother Dong
Fang, you don’t understand. The most important thing for a new club is to recruit people. MO Xiu, can you organize our recruitment?”
“Who said anything about recruiting new people?” asked MO Xiu. The five of us are enough.”
Moxiu had created the club so that he would not have to participate in the club selection. If he wanted to recruit people, wouldn’t he have to choose again? Only five would be suitable for the competition. There was no need for selection.
“Don’t joke around, Boss. Are you planning to only have five people in our club?” Liu Ziyang asked in surprise.”
Moxiu nodded.” Yes, that’s right. Is there a problem?” The five of them could participate in the individual battle or the team battle.”
He Lingyue looked at the others and said, “Our configuration isn’t very
balanced. Three ottensive, one agility-type, and I’m a semi-support. How can we fight in a team battle?”
“The Black Tortoise Club can fight by force, so why can’t we?””
He Lingyue said, “But we only have five people. We don’t even have a substitute.”
Moxiu nodded and said seriously,””lndeed, five people is a little too little. How about this? I’ll give you a mission, and the four of you will discuss and pull in one person. Remember, it’s only one person.”
The four of them looked at each other. What kind of club did they join? Recruiting only one person?
MO Xiu looked at the time. It was already night.
“Let’s have a simple meal together to celebrate the success of our club.”
The few of them were celebrating while looking miserable. They were simply unlucky.
MO Xiu brought the four of them to the cafeteria. It was really just a simple meal.
Ordinary meals, ordinary conversations, no lofty aspirations, no goals. The elders of the strongest club were born during this peaceful dinner.
9 pm, Dorm 312, Dorm 9.
MO Xiu lay on the bed. He could not believe that university life had begun. In the past, he had worked hard so that his mother could live a better life.
Her mother’s life was already very good now. In the future, she would work hard to protect the person she loved for the rest of her life.
When he thought of this, MO Xiu remembered the girl who yearned for ordinary peace, Mu Qingyi.
MO Xiu took out his phone and sent a message to Mu Qingyi.
“How is it? Is everything going well at school?”
After waiting for a long time, Mu Qingyi replied.
“If you want me to call, please leave a message!”
MO Xiu unknowingly started to laugh. Mu Qingyi was still so mischievous. Oh, no, she seemed to only be mischievous towards him.
MO Xiu made a call.
“Hehe, I knew you missed me. I’m fine here. I’m not as sad as I thought.
Everything is normal.”
“Mm-hm, that’s good.”‘
“How are you? Did you cause any trouble in Beijing?” “Of course not. Don’t you know how obedient I am?”
“Which part?”
The phone call between the two of them lasted for half an hour. MO Xiu told Mu Qingyi about Yan Jing University’s competition education methods and how he had created the strongest club, making Mu Qingyi laugh out loud.
However, after hanging up the phone, MO Xiu still realized that something was not right. Mu Qingyi used to be calm and elegant, but she kept joking around today.
In the past, when the two of them were talking, Mu Qingyi would always be the one talking, while MO Xiu was more of a listener. But today, it was the other way around, and MO Xiu was the one talking. Although Mu Qingyi was talking all the time, she did not talk about herself.
MO Xiu sighed. Mu Qingyi was actually not happy, right?
Moxiu couldn’t fall asleep as he kept thinking about this. He opened the Shadow app to look for a quest.
Beijing was different. There were many more missions than Shun City, and there were all kinds of missions. MO Xiu had to choose for a long time before he found a suitable mission.
“Pursuit Mission: Pursue Wang Jinyang.
[Difficulty Level: B]
[Mission details: Wang Jinyang robbed a bank and escaped with a large amount of cash and precious herbs. Age: 24 years old. Three skills are offensive skills and one skill is stealth. According to reliable sources, this person is still active around Yanjing.]
[Mission Completion Condition: Capture Wang Jinyang and hand him over to the Law Enforcement Team (additional reward for handing over the stolen goods).]
[Mission Reward: 6000 points, 4 million cash.]”
Moxiu felt that this skill wasn’t too bad. Judging from the description, the person he was chasing should be an expert. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to not be caught until now. However, he didn’t know if he could defeat an expert with four skills with his current strength.
MO Xiu felt that it was not safe for him to accept this mission alone. After thinking about it, he still gave this mission to Liu Ziyang.
Liu Ziyang called directly.
“Boss, are you joking? A B-rank hunting mission? Even if we can find him, can we beat him? Other than the investigation mission, the other missions that required the help of the law enforcement team would be rewarded.”
“I have my own way.”
Liu Ziyang complained,” Boss, you’ve already advanced, I still have to compete in the class competition. I compete in the day and carry out missions at night, how tiring is that?’”‘
“Alright then, I won’t bring you along. I’ll go by myself.”
Liu Ziyang immediately changed his words.” Alright, alright, alright. I’m afraid of you. But you have to tell me what your plan is.” Let me learn.”
“Hehe, you’ll know tomorrow..””


                    



Chapter 48: The Serious Club Has a Mission

The next morning, in the activity room of the Strongest Club.
Moxiu had come early in the morning to apply for a room that was less than thirty square meters. The staff had made it very clear that with the current scale of the Strongest Club, they could only apply for this room.
However, Moxiu didn’t mind. There was no training or selection anyway. There were only five people in total. It was fine as long as there was a place for the meeting.
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren were both going to participate in the class selection, so MO Xiu called for a meeting before class started.
After they arrived, they were all very puzzled. Moxiu’s performance yesterday clearly showed that he wanted to be a hands-off manager. Why did he suddenly wake up after only one night?
“MO Xiu, why did you call us here?” Hao Ren asked. There was no training, no selection, and no recruitment.”
“Sigh, there’s no need for a proper club to do such flashy things,” Moxiu said shamelessly.”
Dong Fang asked seriously,””Then what does a proper club like ours have?”
MO Xiu praised,” Look at Dong Fang. He knows what to ask. We are a proper club. A proper club has missions.””
When Liu Ziyang heard this, he finally understood what MO Xiu wanted to do. So this was the method MO Xiu had mentioned last night? Pulling the entire club into a trap?
Moxiu took out a few pieces of printed mission information and handed them to them.
Liu Ziyang took it and looked at it. As expected, it was the capture mission of An Ying.
When Dong Fang saw the mission, he was a little excited. He had never come into contact with this before.
Hao Ren and He Lingyue both looked at MO Xiu strangely.
‘What’s wrong?” asked MO Xiu. Why are you looking at me like that?” “Boss, you joined the law enforcement team?” Hao Ren asked tentatively.” MO Xiu shook his head.
“Then why did you receive such a mission?” Hao Ren asked again.”
Before MO Xiu could answer, He Lingyue continued, “”This is not the task of the law enforcement team. If the law enforcement team has such information, they will definitely send out a small team to capture them. They will not issue a task to let people escape.”
MO Xiu looked at He Lingyue with interest. He didn’t know He Lingyue very well, but he didn’t expect her to be such a meticulous girl.
“Where do you think the mission came from?” Hao Ren asked He Lingyue.”
He Lingyue pondered for a moment and said, “The information is more well-informed than the law enforcement team, and they can also issue missions. That can only be the shadow.’”‘
MO Xiu couldn’t help but applaud He Lingyue. She had figured out that it was Shadow’s mission based on this little clue.
Other than having a clear mind, she also had a certain understanding of the various departments. MO Xiu was a little curious about He Lingyue’s background.
Liu Ziyang couldn’t help but say,” D * mn, this girl is amazing. Moxiu and I are indeed Shadow.””
MO Xiu didn’t mind Liu Ziyang revealing his identity. Wang Yu had said before in the cosmic tuition class that the Dark Shadow wasn’t a secret organization that needed to be kept a secret.
Previously in Shun City, he didn’t publicly announce that he was Shadow, mainly because he wanted to hide the Universe cram school.
“That’s right, this is our Shadow’s mission. You guys should consider if you want to join us.””
Hao Ren and Dong Fang didn’t really believe Liu Ziyang’s words. He had never heard of it before.
As for He Lingyue, she only said that this was a Dark Shadow mission. She didn’t expect MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang to be Dark Shadow members.
Now that Moxiu had spoken, they were certain that these two were monsters.
“How did you join Shadow?” He Lingyue asked. As far as I know, Shadow’s recruitment requirement is two skills, and only one in ten thousand people are selected. Many of the school’s top talents are not selected.”
MO Xiu directly said,”l can’t tell you how I got selected. Do you guys want to participate in this mission?’”‘
Hao Ren said, ” I’d like to join. After all, it’s Shadow’s mission. I want to see it. But the reward… Do we have a share?”
Dong Fang, who had been in a daze and did not speak, looked at MO Xiu expectantly when he heard about the reward.
“I’ve already given you a reward in the information I gave you just now,” Moxiu said.”lt’s 6000 points and 4 million in cash. Do any of you want to quit?” If not, I’ll talk about the reward distribution.”
Seeing that no one spoke, MO Xiu continued,”This mission is divided into two phases, investigation and arrest. Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang have to attend classes in the morning, so they can’t participate in the investigation completely.” The two of them shook their heads.
“You won’t need the points. I’ll split it with Liu Ziyang. I’ll get 4000 points, Liu Ziyang will get 2000 points, Dong Fang and He Lingyue will each get 1.5 million, and Hao Ren will get 1 million.”
This time, Moxiu didn’t want to be egalitarian. It was better to use a reasonable distribution method.
The few of them were very satisfied with Moxiu’s distribution. After considering it thoroughly, they all nodded and agreed.
Alright,” MO Xiu said.” The first meeting of the Strongest Club is over. Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang, go to class. He Lingyue and Dong Fang, get ready to go with me to investigate.’”‘
MO Xiu suddenly thought of something and stopped Liu Ziyang.”By the way,
Liu Ziyang, Qiang Zi is from your company, right? Can we use it temporarily?”
Liu Ziyang said indifferently,” Of course you can. Qiangzi is my dad’s chauffeur at Yanjing University. I’ve already told him. If you want to go out and find him, you can contact him yourself.”‘
After bidding farewell to Liu Ziyang and the other two, MO Xiu contacted Qiang Zi. Qiang Zi was also from the support system. His skills were not practical and he was eliminated early in the third-year inter-class competition. This was also the reason why Qiang Zi came out to find a part-time job.
Qiang Zi was on call and soon drove to the school gate. MO Xiu and the other two got into the car.
“Boss, where are you going?” Qiang Zi asked as soon as he got on the car.” Moxiu handed the map marked on the mission information to Qiang Zi.
“Have you been to this place before? We found a secluded spot to park the car and walked over.”
Qiang Zi frowned and said,”Boss, you want to go to Fan Street?” What are you going there for?”
“What happened there?” asked MO Xiu. Let’s go carry out the mission.”
Qiang Zi nodded and said,” I’m on a mission. It’s very chaotic there. It’s in Yanjing, but it’s not under Yanjing’s jurisdiction. It’s a chaotic area. There are all kinds of ghosts and monsters there, and there’s often a black market.””
“Have you been there before?” asked MO Xiu. Do you know anything about that place?”
Qiang Zi answered truthfully,” I’ve taken a few business deals. Some bosses wanted to go to the black market there to buy things. For safety reasons, they brought me there. Of course, they had a lot of bodyguards. I’ve been waiting in the car and didn’t go in.”
MO Xiu looked at Dong Fang and He Lingyue, wanting to know what they knew about Fan Street. Dong Fang shook his head, indicating that he didn’t know.
He Lingyue said,” I’ve been to Fan Street once. It’s not as chaotic as I thought. Most people are very law-abiding, but it’s very dangerous if you offend someone there. Murders often happen.’”‘
“Alright, let’s go and take a look first.””
There was one thing that interested Moxiu, and that was the black market. The things in the black market had unknown origins and could have been robbed. If he wanted to sell them, the price would definitely be cheaper.
MO Xiu and the others were dressed somewhat like students, so they had specially bought some clothes from the mall.
After changing their clothes, they went straight to Fan Street….


                    



Chapter 49: Fan Street Black Market

Mo Xiu and the other two got out of the car and told Qiang Zi to return to school first. They would contact him if there was anything to prevent him from giving himself away.
The three of them had been carefully styled. Mo Xiu was dressed in an exaggerated manner, looking like a rich kid.
He Lingyue was dressed in branded clothes. She wasn’t very flirtatious, but she exuded an aristocratic aura as she played MO Xiu’s girlfriend.
As for Dong Fang, he didn’t even need to dress up. He wore a black suit and looked like a bodyguard.
When the three of them walked into Fan Street, it was obvious that the two rich second-generation heirs had brought bodyguards here to look for excitement.
Fan Street was indeed a street, and on both sides of the street were two rows of residential buildings.
This location was very special. It was a street with two rows of residential buildings. It was surrounded by mountains and there were no other buildings around.
It was like a lonely tribe. Because it was surrounded by mountains, ordinary vehicles couldn’t enter. MO Xiu also asked Qiang Zi to park the car at a farther place. The three of them had to climb over a mountain to reach this place.
As soon as they entered the street, MO Xiu sat down by the roadside and said,””What the hell is this place? I still have to climb the mountain to come in.
I’m so tired.”
He Lingyue saw MO Xiu sitting on the ground and immediately came over to persuade him,””Aiya, why are you sitting down? It’s already noon. We might not be able to leave today, Let’s find a place to stay first.”
When MO Xiu heard this, he jumped up and grabbed He Lingyue’s shoulder.”Baby, why are you in such a hurry? You’ve only just arrived, and you’re already thinking…”
He Lingyue gently pushed MO Xiu away and said,”Aiya, you’re so bad. Let’s get down to business first.’”‘
When the people around them saw MO Xiu and He Lingyue like this, they were no longer surprised. There were too many people like this.
MO Xiu and the other two walked around and were surprised to find that Fan Street had all kinds of places.
After taking a look, Moxiu almost thought that this was a resort. There was no bad atmosphere here, and every shop owner was trying to attract business.
MO Xiu and the other two entered a small restaurant and were immediately welcomed by a shop assistant.
“What would you like to eat?”
MO Xiu glanced at the shop assistant and said to He Lingyue,”Baby, what do you want to eat?”
He Lingyue looked at the decorations in the shop with disgust.
“Aiya, what can a small shop like this have? Just take a bite.”
“Bring up all your best dishes. Hurry up!” MO Xiu said to the shop assistant.” The shop assistant agreed and went down.
The dishes were served very quickly, but the dishes were very ordinary. They were all vegetarian dishes that they usually ate.
“What’s wrong with you?” Moxiu asked the shop assistant unhappily. Did you not understand what I said just now? I want your best vegetables.”
After the shop assistant served the dishes, she became much more unyielding and said disdainfully,”What’s wrong? Was this boss looking for trouble? This is our best dish!”
MO Xiu slammed the table. Dong Fang immediately stood up and grabbed the shop assistant’s collar.
The shop assistant was caught, but he didn’t panic at all. He shouted, “Someone is causing trouble!”
Seven or eight people appeared out of nowhere in the originally small store and surrounded MO Xiu and the other two.
MO Xiu stood up and shouted at this group of people,””Aiya, are you trying to scam me? Do you know who I am?”
One of the burly men walked over and said, “It doesn’t matter who you are here. Everything in Fan Street is based on strength. Don’t ask for names. Today, you
guys 0Decnent1Y eat your rooa ana pay tne Dill.”
“You…” Moxiu said angrily. You!”
At this moment, He Lingyue said to the burly man,”Misunderstanding, it’s all a misunderstanding. We just wanted to have a simple bite.”
“Alright, don’t forget why we’re here.’”‘
MO Xiu suppressed his anger and sat back down. Dong Fang also let go of the shop assistant and sat down.
The big man smiled and said,”Kid, look at your girl. She’s more sensible than you.””
MO Xiu turned his head around and ignored the burly man.
The burly man said to He Lingyue lecherously,”Beauty, my name is Prisoner. Come and find me when it’s convenient?”
When MO Xiu heard this, he was so angry that he cursed,”F * Ck you, how dare you flirt with my woman?”
The prisoner laughed and left.
MO Xiu was still talking about something at the table, causing the people around him to laugh out loud. Wasn’t this just a lack of ability and only knew how to act cool?
After the meal, MO Xiu went to the front desk to pay the bill. The four vegetarian dishes cost a total of 5000 yuan.
Moxiu’s heart twitched, but he didn’t seem to mind as he threw out the cash.
After paying the bill, MO Xiu left unhappily. He Lingyue stayed behind. He Lingyue found the prisoner and asked, ‘”‘This big brother.”
When the prisoner saw He Lingyue, he chuckled and said,””So what if she’s a beauty? Are you tired of your useless boyfriend and want something exciting?”
He Lingyue said helplessly,” Sigh, if it weren’t for the fact that I had no choice, who would want to follow him? I’m here to ask about some things.”” “What is it?” asked the prisoner.
“We came here to look for some things in the black market. I heard that the things in the black market are more complete than the market, but we didn’t find any black market just now.”
When the prisoner saw that He Lingyue had something to ask of him, he immediately lost interest.
“I can also tell you. You can either exchange it with money or you. In this place, no one will help you. Everything is a transaction.”
“I’ll exchange it with money!” He Lingyue said.
The prisoner stretched out three fingers and said,” I won’t cheat you. Thirty thousand!”
He Lingyue took out 30,000 yuan of cash from her bag and handed it to the prisoner.
The prisoner took the money and weighed it before saying,” The black market starts at midnight every night. It’s on the street. There’s a small market every day and a big market every three days. The big market just ended and there’ll be a big market the night after tomorrow. ”
He Lingyue nodded and said nothing more. She turned around and walked out of the store.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang were waiting at the door. He Lingyue looked at each other when she came out.
“Let’s find a place to rest first,” He Lingyue said.”
Alright,” Moxiu said lazily.” Let’s quickly find a place to stay. I’m exhausted from the journey.””
It was easy to find a place to stay. There was only one hotel on Fan Street. Surprisingly, it was quite large and occupied an entire building. There was a big advertisement outside the hotel: ‘Fan Street’s Safe Haven.’
As it was a residential building, the rooms inside were all ordinary. MO Xiu chose a room with two bedrooms and a living room. He didn’t need to show his ID card or register his name. He just needed money and a deposit. The three of them had just entered the room when Dong Fang said,”We…”
MO Xiu interrupted him halfway.
“What are you standing here for? Don’t disturb our interest, go back to your own room.”
MO Xiu and He Lingyue looked at each other and began to search the room.
“Dong Fang, how’s your room?” MO Xiu asked half an hour later.”
Dong Fang came out and said, “I just found out that you were afraid of being monitored. I looked in that room, but there was nothing. ‘”‘
The three of them sat on the sofa. MO Xiu asked He Lingyue,””How did your inquiries go? Where is the black market?”
He Lingyue told MO Xiu everything the prisoner had told her about the black market.
“MO Xiu, aren’t we here to look for Wang Jinyang?” Dong Fang asked in confusion. Why are you acting?”
MO Xiu explained,” You just need to act as your bodyguard. If we were to look for Wang Jinyang directly, not only would we alert the enemy, but it would also cause dissatisfaction in this place. Did you see what happened at the restaurant just now?” This place was not as peaceful as it seemed..”

                    



Chapter 50: Step by Step

He Lingyue continued,” If you want to find Wang Jinyang, the best way is to enter the black market and lure him out, right?””
MO Xiu nodded. Now he felt that He Lingyue was very smart. They hadn’t discussed this before coming, but she had been cooperating very well.
MO Xiu saw that Dong Fang still didn’t quite understand, so he continued to explain.
“Do you remember the information given by the mission? Wang Jinyang robbed the bank and had a lot of cash on him. He also had a Spirit Gathering Grass. This grass is the key. I guess he’s probably preparing to make a move here.”
“How can you be sure that Wang Jinyang hasn’t sold it yet?” Dong Fang asked.”
If it were me, I wouldn’t easily sell a precious herb of unknown origin,” said
MO Xiu.” I would definitely find a fool to raise the price.’”‘
He Lingyue covered her mouth and pointed at MO Xiu.””Moxiu is currently playing the role of this fool.”
Dong Fang suddenly understood and said,” Mm, MO Xiu, you’ve performed the essence. If I were Wang Jinyang, I’d sell it to a fool like you.””
MO Xiu rolled his eyes at Dong Fang. What they needed to do now was to wait until midnight to go out and see the black market.
At this moment, Liu Ziyang sent a message.
“Boss, Hao Ren and I are done with class. Shall we go over and find you now?”
He Lingyue looked closer and said, “There’s no need for them to come, right?” If they come to meet up with us, it might arouse the suspicion of others.”
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren don’t need to join us,” MO Meng said after a pause.” They can act alone. They have their own uses. ‘”‘
“What use is it?” He Lingyue asked.”
“Do you think Wang Jinyang came here for any other purpose other than selling herbs and taking refuge?”
He Lingyue pondered for a moment and shook her head. She couldn’t think of any other possibility.
“Hahaha, women don’t understand…” Moxiu said.
As she spoke, she replied to Liu Ziyang’s message on her phone.
Dong Fang was not listening to the conversation between the two. Instead, he turned on the television and was laughing loudly.
At 11:30 pm, Moxiu and the other two went downstairs. When they reached the hotel counter, Moxiu asked,’”‘Hey, bro, this Fan Street is so awesome. Is there any… That kind of place? A place where you can spend money to play?”
The young man at the counter glanced at He Lingyue and said, “Yes, it’s just in front. It’s easy to find at night.”
“Hehe, thank you, brother.” MO Xiu laughed lewdly.”
He gave the counter man a look that said, “You know what I mean.”
He Lingyue grabbed MO Xiu’s ear and said,””We’re here for serious matters.”
The three of them walked out of the hotel. He Lingyue appeared on the street with MO Xiu by her arm, and Dong Fang followed behind them.
It wasn’t even 12 0’clock yet, but there were already some people preparing to set up their stalls.
MO Xiu carefully observed the people who were setting up stalls. Most of them were locals who lived here, but there were also some who came from outside to sell things.
At the same time, Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang also arrived.
“Brother Liu, what’s our mission?” Hao Ren asked.’
“After my efforts, our mission is very simple.” Liu Ziyang said proudly.”
“What mission?”
Liu Ziyang took out a printed photo of Wang Jinyang and handed it to Hao Ren. “Remember Wang Jinyang’s appearance, the rest is just for fun.”
The two of them didn’t even look at the black market on the street. They went straight to the place that Moxiu had mentioned.
He Lingyue happened to see this scene.
He Lingyue whispered into MO Xiu’s ear,””This is your arrangement? Is this something that women don’t understand?”
Moxiu replied,” A man who stole so much cash and a precious herb to come here instead of running away could only have two goals. One is to sell medicine to earn money, and the other is to spend money for fun.”
He Lingyue said in an inaudible voice,””Despicable!”
As the three of them walked, the entire black market was revealed. Both sides of Fan Street were filled with stalls.
Moxiu walked over to a shop and squatted down to see if there was anything good. However, as he looked around, he saw that it was filled with common herbs and weapons. He asked for the price and found that it was about 30% lower than the market price. It was still a considerable price.
From a rough look, there was nothing important. After chatting with the stall owner, he realized that good things were hard to come by. They either appeared in the market or were occasionally sold in a hurry and had to be taken out.
MO Xiu and the other two walked around and were about to go back to sleep when an item on a stall caught MO Xiu’s attention.
It was a short black scabbard. Moxiu was interested in this because the dagger that Elder Tang had given him previously did not have a scabbard.
The black dagger was extremely sharp, and it was very inconvenient to carry it without a scabbard.
Moxiu crouched down and did not directly ask for the price of the scabbard. Instead, he pointed at a medicinal herb that he did not recognize.
“Boss, what is this?”
When the stall owner saw that MO Xiu was so gullible, he immediately said, “”This is an extremely precious medicinal herb that can strengthen the body.”
“Oh?” MO Xiu’s eyes lit up. Would it improve his body greatly? I’m here to find herbs to improve my physical fitness. As long as the herbs are good, no matter how much it costs, it’s not a problem.”
When the boss saw Moxiu’s idiotic look, he immediately flattered him.
“Needless to say, the energy contained inside is extremely strong. It has reached the spirit level. I’ll give you a cheaper price, 500,000.”
MO Xiu found it funny. Herbs were divided into four levels according to the energy they contained. The Human Level was the more expensive herbs on the market. Most of them were used to strengthen the body.
It was different when one reached the Spirit level. It could have a breakthrough in a certain aspect. For example, the Spirit Ring that could upgrade a skill from Level 1 to Level 2 was a Spirit level herb.
MO Xiu had never even seen Earth Grade or Heaven Grade herbs before. The Spirit Gathering Grass that Wang Jinyang had stolen this time was at the peak of the Spirit Grade, and its effect was to completely improve one’s physical fitness.
As for this lousy herb in the stall, it was still questionable whether it had reached the Human Rank or not.
Although he thought that this boss was really evil, Moxiu looked very tempted on the surface. As he spoke, he was about to take out the money.
He Lingyue stopped him.” We’re not buying it. Boss, aren’t you too ruthless? This thing looks like a weed. Let’s go.”
Seeing that he had been seen through, the boss immediately called out to MO Xiu and the others.
“Hey, hey, hey, don’t go. I have something new here. Do you want to take a look?”
When Moxiu heard that it was something novel, he stood up and squatted down again.
“Boss, what is it? Show me!”
The boss took out something from his pocket. Moxiu took a closer look and saw that it was a pistol.
He Lingyue obviously didn’t expect that there would be firearms in this place.
MO Xiu snatched it over and held it in his hands.
The boss smiled and said,” Be careful. This can be used. Don’t let it go off. Noble children like you love this kind of thing the most.”
“Boss, how much is it?” He Lingyue asked. I think even if this is the black market, this kind of thing can’t be sold openly, right?”
“The lady is right. How about I sell it to you for 100,000 yuan?
MO Xiu took out 100,000 yuan and handed it to the boss.””Deal. I’m not bargaining. You have to give me something.”
The boss pointed at the herbs that Moxiu had just seen and said,’”‘How about this herb as a gift to you?”
Moxiu grabbed the scabbard and said,”l don’t want that stupid grass. I’ll just take anything.
With that, he turned around and left.
The boss shouted from behind, “No, come back. I’ll give you something else…”
Sigh, I’ve lost it, I’ve lost it..”

                    



Chapter 51: The Willing Take the Bait (1)

MO Xiu and the other two didn’t continue strolling and returned to the hotel. As soon as he returned, Moxiu put the black dagger back into its scabbard. No matter how he looked at it, it seemed suitable.
Moreover, this scabbard was not simple. He did not know what material it was made of, but it was as smooth as jade.
He Lingyue saw it and said, “Your goal from the beginning was this scabbard, right?’”‘
MO Xiu nodded.
He Lingyue continued, “Your dagger is so beautiful. What’s its name?””
Moxiu was stunned for a moment. That’s right, what was the name of the black dagger?
“Just call him…Black Kirin.”
“Good name, ah, a’s ‘or’s’
“But I didn’t expect to get an unexpected reward this time.” Moxiu took out his pistol.”
When He Lingyue saw the pistol, she said with a serious expression,”Yes, this is really unexpected.”
” I don’t know much about this,” Moxiu asked.” Do you know about the emergence of overheated weapons in recent years?’”‘
MO Xiu and He Lingyue looked at Dong Fang. This guy turned on the TV and laughed as soon as he returned to the hotel. He was hopeless.
He Lingyue said, “I know a little about the news in Yanjing. There are indeed a lot of people causing trouble in Yanjing, but using firearms…” I haven’t heard of it for so many years.”
Alright, let’s not talk about this for now. We can investigate after this mission is over,” Moxiu said as he put away his gun.”
In the Shadow system, other than accepting missions from the software, one could also create their own missions. After completing the mission, the system would automatically give a rating and corresponding rewards. If the conditions allowed, MO Xiu wanted to investigate.
“What do we do now?” He Lingyue asked.”
MO Xiu glanced at his watch and said, “Wait!””
“Wait for what?”
“Wait for those two ghosts to come back.”
An hour later, Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang helped each other back to the hotel.
Moxiu had checked the entire hotel and there was no surveillance. It could really be considered a safe haven for Fan Street.
Therefore, the two of them did not return to their own rooms. Instead, they went straight to MO Xiu’s room.
As soon as they entered the door, the two of them collapsed on the sofa, squeezing Dong Fang, who was originally watching television on the sofa, to the side.
“How is it?” asked MO Xiu.
Liu Ziyang volunteered,”l’ll say it!” I’ll say it! The inside is awesome. That girl, hehe! Awesome!”
Hao Ren laughed foolishly and said,” Hehe, I’ve been staring at this beauty for the whole night, but I didn’t dare to talk to her.””
Liu Ziyang said resentfully, “You’re really useless. The women who come here, how can they be serious?” If you’re not rich, I’ll get it for you.”
He Lingyue pouted and looked at MO Xiu. MO Xiu was also a little embarrassed.
He had asked these two people to investigate Wang Jinyang, but he didn’t expect them to say this.
“Hey, hey, hey! You two, how’s the mission going? Did you find Wang Jinyang?”
Liu Ziyang was a little confused. He looked at Hao Ren and said,””Have you seen Wang Jinyang?”
“Huh?” Hao Ren asked in confusion. Who was Wang Jinyang? Is it that girl from today?”
Liu Ziyang realized his mistake and immediately apologized to MO Xiu.
“Boss, listen to me. The two of us have never been to such a place before. We were a little absent-minded the moment we entered, but… The two of us looked very carefully. Wang Jinyang shouldn’t have appeared.”
“Should?” He Lingyue said unhappily. Are you guys on a mission or playing?”
The two of them were instantly sober after He Lingyue said that. They sat up straight on the sofa obediently.
Just like that, MO Xiu watched He Lingyue persuade and educate her for half an hour.
In the end, He Lingyue was probably tired, so she shook her head and sighed before going back to her room to sleep.
Before he left, he said to MO Xiu,”This is the way!” This is something that women don’t understand!”
MO Xiu didn’t understand why He Lingyue was so angry.
After He Lingyue entered the room, MO Xiu asked,’”‘Tell me what’s going on inside.”
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren’s gloominess disappeared as soon as they heard this.
During the narration, the most excited person was not the two of them, but Dong Fang, who was watching the show from the side.
Dong Fang exclaimed after hearing this.
“F * ck, MO Xiu, why didn’t you give me such a good mission? Why do you want me to be a bodyguard?”
“Brother Liu Ziyang, can we exchange?”
“I’m going back to sleep. I still have to participate in the inter-class competition tomorrow.”
Brother Hao Ren…”
“Goodbye!”
After Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren left, MO Xiu sat on the sofa and started thinking.
According to their description, this place was similar to a nightclub, but the difference was that the women inside were basically staff. They could do whatever they wanted with money.
If that was the case, MO Xiu felt that there was a high chance that Wang Jinyang was there, unless Wang Jinyang was gay.
He was speechless for a night.
The next day, MO Xiu woke up and sat on the sofa waiting for He Lingyue and Dong Fang to wake up.
MO Xiu wanted to sleep in the room last night, but He Lingyue was a girl, so she naturally wanted her own room. Dong Fang was too big to sleep on the sofa, so in the end, he could only let MO Xiu sleep on the sofa in the living room.
By the time they woke up, Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang had already returned to school.
After the three of them met up, they ran amok on Fan Street.
The image of MO Xiu, a brainless young master, appearing on Fan Street for two consecutive days was simply deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.
Many people wanted to take the opportunity to rip MO Xiu off, but they also knew that this young master had a shrewd girlfriend by his side, so it was not easy to do so at the moment.
In the wee hours of the morning, MO Xiu brought He Lingyue and his bodyguard Dong Fang around the black market again.
Not long after, MO Xiu sneaked out and headed straight for the venue.
As soon as MO Xiu entered, he was shocked by the scene inside. No wonder Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren forgot to carry out their mission when they came here yesterday.
The lights here were dim and mainly red. The music was not as noisy as expected. Instead, it was quiet music. The women inside were dressed in different styles and were relatively cool. They actually gave people a high-class feeling.
MO Xiu quickly looked away and searched the hall. He first saw Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren, who also saw MO Xiu and were giving him a look.
MO Xiu took out his phone and looked at it. Liu Ziyang had sent him a message.
“Target spotted, at your eight o’clock.”
MO Xiu inadvertently glanced over. It was indeed Wang Jinyang.
However, when he saw Wang Jinyang, he frowned and sent a message to Liu Ziyang.
After waiting for a while, MO Xiu walked towards Wang Jinyang with a smile.
He walked to a nearby spot and hugged a woman beside him.”Baby, do you want to play for a while?”
Before the woman could say anything, a figure bumped into MO Xiu’s shoulder, causing him to stagger.
MO Xiu didn’t ask, so he directly scolded,””Damn it, who doesn’t have eyes?”
The one who bumped into MO Xiu was Liu Ziyang. Liu Ziyang laughed strangely and said, “Hey, isn’t this Young Master Xiao? Why are you here? What can you do here?”
When MO Xiu saw that it was Liu Yang, he immediately softened.
“Damn it, how unlucky. Why did I meet a b * tch like you?”
At this moment, the woman MO Xiu had just hugged said,””Boss, don’t be angry. Tell me how you want to play.”
MO Xiu shook off the woman’s hand and said, “I’m not playing anymore. ‘”‘
Then, Liu Ziyang said to Hao Ren,””This idiot. He’s impotent and yet he’s here to be humiliated.”
“Yeah, stupid people have a lot of money,” Hao Ren agreed.”
The two of them chatted and were about to leave when a voice sounded behind them.

                    



Chapter 52: Best Director MO Xiu

The person who spoke was Wang Jinyang.
Liu Ziyang turned around and looked at Wang Jinyang.””What’s the matter?”
Wang Jinyang leaned against the counter and said,’”‘Do you two know that brother?”
“What brothers?” Hao Ren asked. That person was a piece of trash. He relied on his money and was nothing.”
Liu Ziyang sized up Wang Jinyang and said warily, “Is there something you need?”
“I want to know all the information about that person just now.”
Brother,” Liu Ziyang said disdainfully,” although we’ve only been here for a few days, we also know the rules of Fan Street. If you want to know the news, you have to exchange it with money. ‘”‘
Wang Jinyang took out a wad of money from his bag and said,”50,ooo. I want to know the information of that person just now.”
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren looked at each other and said,””Alright, no problem. What do you want to know?”
Wang Jinyang stretched out three fingers and said,””First, this person’s basic information. Second, how rich was this person? What were they doing at Fan Street? Third, I request that this information be kept confidential. I can’t tell anyone that I’ve revealed this information.”
Liu Ziyang snatched the money and said,”Deal!”
“This person is called Xiao Qing. The power behind him is very big. He has so much money that you can’t imagine. I can more or less guess.”
Wang Jinyang moved closer to Liu Ziyang and listened carefully.
Liu Ziyang continued,” He has a problem in that area. Don’t look at how he brings his girlfriend around all day. It’s actually only for a minute. Didn’t you see how dissatisfied his girlfriend is all day? I guess he’s here to buy medicine that can cure him, hahaha.”
Hao Ren also burst into laughter, and the two of them mocked MO Xiu again.
Wang Jinyang was very satisfied after hearing that. He nodded and said, “Alright, the deal is over. The two of you can pretend that you’ve never seen me.”
Liu Ziyang grabbed Wang Jinyang’s arm and said,””Brother, do you have any good ideas to trick him? We can help you!”
Wang Jinyang slapped Liu Ziyang’s hand away. His eyes were filled with killing intent.
Liu Ziyang was so frightened that he quickly retracted his hand and said shakily, “Please leave, please leave!”
Wang Jinyang glared at Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren and said,””lf I find out that you’ve spread this matter, your lives will be in danger.”
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren ran back to the hotel and went to MO Xiu’s room.
After entering the house, Liu Ziyang immediately became smug and said to
Hao Ren,””Tell Boss about it. How was your performance?”
Hao Ren gave him a thumbs up and said,” Brother Liu’s acting skills are amazing, especially the fear and panic he showed after being threatened by Wang Jinyang. It’s so vivid!””
Liu Ziyang had a complicated expression on his face. He could have bragged about the whole scene, but Hao Ren insisted on bragging about it. It wasn’t an act; he was really scared when he saw Wang Jinyang’s murderous intent.
Moxiu waved his hand and said, “Alright, you two. Tell me what happened.””
Hao Ren told MO Xiu the whole story, and MO Xiu asked for many details. After making sure that Wang Jinyang didn’t suspect anything, he was relieved.
“Mm, not bad. You two didn’t carry the reputation of lechers and did something. Wang Jinyang has already taken the bait.”
MO Xiu glanced at He Lingyue as he spoke, meaning, ‘Is my method okay?’ “I didn’t expect you two to be so good at acting,” said He Lingyue.”
“That’s a must, but it’s also thanks to MO Yingdi’s professional guidance for the whole afternoon.” Liu Ziyang said proudly.”
That’s right. In order to let the two of them act out this act well, Moxiu had taught them for an entire afternoon and rehearsed it countless times.
Everything was ready. They were just waiting for Wang Jinyang to take the initiative to come to them tomorrow. Then, they would lead him to an uninhabited place to arrest him.
Everyone dispersed, and Moxiu sat on the sofa alone, deep in thought.
It seemed like everything was under control, but there were many uncertainties.
When he went to find Wang Jinyang today, MO Xiu had actually come up with two plans. He would use God’s Snooping on Wang Jinyang as soon as he entered. If Wang Jinyang was weak, MO Xiu, Liu Ziyang, and Hao Ren would have attacked him directly. However, the result he saw made MO Xiu very worried.
” Skill 1: Extreme Sword
[Skill Effect: Summons a sword as a weapon. Increases Strength by 100% when used.]
[Duration: 3 minutes] [Cooldown: 3 hours]
[Second Skill: Bursting Flames] [Skill Effect: Summon Fireball to deal damage]
[Cooldown: 25 minutes]
[Third Skill: Spirit Flash Stab]
[Skill Effect: After being released, it will quickly attack in the specified direction. The distance is 5 meters. When in the attack state, it is invincible and cannot be attacked.] [Cooldown: 3 hours]
[Fourth Skill: Invisibility 2] [Skill effect: Enter stealth state after activation]
[Duration: 5 minutes]
[Cooldown time: 12 hours]
This was Wang Jinyang’s skill. The four skills did not belong to the same category. The skills were very mixed but very difficult to deal with.
Originally, MO Xiu thought that Wang Jinyang could rob a bank, so he should have a few very powerful offensive skills.
But now, it seemed that the real difficulty was how to catch him.
One or two skills were easy to understand, and they weren’t particularly strong. If he paid a little attention in battle, he shouldn’t be injured.
The last two skills were difficult to deal with. There was no need to talk about invisibility. Once they lost their tracks, it would be difficult to find them.
However, if he only had the Stealth skill, he could catch Wang Jinyang in the instant he was invisible.
What was really difficult to deal with were these three skills. On its own, this skill was very useless. It could only advance five meters and could not attack, but when used with the Stealth skill, it was very powerful.
After activating Stealth, he immediately released three skills to advance. During this period, he was invincible. If he was not careful, he would lose track of Wang Jinyang.
There was only one problem in front of MO Xiu, and that was how to capture Wang Jinyang.
The next morning, it was the third day that MO Xiu and the others had been here. It was also the day of the black market, and it was the best time to capture Wang Jinyang.
As usual, MO Xiu brought He Lingyue and Dong Fang around Fan Street in the morning.
He mentioned that he wanted to buy something from the black market tonight. He had plenty of money, but he didn’t know if there were any good things.
After walking around, he returned to the hotel in the afternoon.
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren also arrived at the hotel quietly.
After the two of them arrived, Moxiu immediately gathered everyone for a meeting with a serious expression.
“Boss, why are we still having a meeting?” Liu Ziyang asked. I think we just need to conserve our energy and wait until night to lure Wang Jinyang to a deserted place.”
As he spoke, he even used his right hand to wipe his neck.
” We can’t be careless,” Moxiu said.” Do you think the five of us are stronger than the bank guards?””
Everyone fell silent. Yes, Wang Jinyang robbed a bank.
” I can see from the information that he has a stealth skill,” Moxiu continued.” I guess he used that skill to escape.”‘
He Lingyue frowned and said, “But we don’t know what his skill is. How do we set it up?
Moxiu smiled and said, “Then imagine the worst possibility. His stealth skill is to disappear into thin air! ‘”‘
The few of them looked at MO Xiu strangely. What was the point of him disappearing into thin air? He definitely wouldn’t be able to catch him.
MO Xiu looked at them and continued, “Alright then. No one can catch him if he disappears into thin air. Besides the worst possibility of him disappearing into thin air, he can turn invisible.”
He Lingyue’s eyes lit up.” That’s reliable. The worst case scenario we might face is invisibility. Tell me how to do it specifically.” What’s your plan?”
“I need to know what your skills are..”

                    



Chapter 53: A Good Show (1)

“I need to know what your skills are.”
Other than Liu Ziyang, the others were all very surprised because it was very unreasonable to directly ask about the skill. Even if they were teammates, they would slowly become familiar with it after continuous practice.
Among the people present, only Liu Ziyang knew how terrifying Moxiu was. Moxiu’s accurate grasp of the situation and his development of skills.
Liu Ziyang saw that the others did not speak and said,” I’ve got the ability to gain the ability to gain the ability to gain the ability to gain the ability to gain.”
Motheo interrupted him.”You don’t have to say anything. I know everything. If you guys are worried, I’ll talk about myself first. My skill is a status type skill. After activating it, all attributes will increase by 300%.”
Silence! The room was silent. Even Liu Ziyang knew that Moxiu’s skill had leveled up. Originally, it had increased by 100%, but now it had suddenly increased by 300%.
However, wasn’t this 300% too terrifying? Moreover, it was all attributes. No one had ever heard of a skill with all attributes.
Hao Ren gulped and said, “Mo…” Boss MO, as expected of the top scorer of the college entrance examination, as expected of An Ying…”
He Lingyue was also shocked.” MO Xiu, I’m sorry to ask, but your skill has been upgraded to level
“Level 2 skill. Alright, who wants to talk about their skill next?”
He Lingyue had always known that MO Xiu was very strong, but she didn’t know that he had such great potential.
Dong Fang was the first to say,””My skill is called Golden Body. After it is released, it will increase your defense by 200%, attack by 100%, and harden your skin.”
Another freak. MO Xiu could tell during the inter-class competition that Dong Fang’s skills must be very strong.
After Dong Fang finished speaking, everyone seemed to have let go.
“My skill is Heavy Punch,” Hao Ren said. “When I punch, my attack will increase by 500%.”
Seeing that everyone else had said it, He Lingyue also said, “My skill is foresight. I can predict the next move of others.” MO Xiu’s eyes lit up as he looked at He Lingyue.
“Boss, don’t forget that you have Mu Qingyi!”
MO Xiu pushed Liu Ziyang away and said to He Lingyue,””Tell me in detail,
under what conditions can I predict?”
“He’s within three meters of me,” He Lingyue said reluctantly.”
Moxiu lowered his head and pondered. In fact, Moxiu had already used God’s Snoop to see these people’s skills, and there wasn’t much of a difference from what they had said.
What shocked MO Xiu the most was He Lingyue.
” Skill: Future 2
[Skill effect: A target becomes a Future Person, and the next action of others within three meters can be predicted.]
[Duration: 7 minutes]
[Cooldown time: 6 hours]
This skill once again refreshed MO Xiu’s knowledge. This should be a skill of the ability system. Perhaps because the skill could be used on others, He Lingyue chose to use the support system.
MO Xiu was thinking when Liu Ziyang shouted, “”Boss, I haven’t introduced the skill yet.”
“I know your skill,” Moxiu said impatiently.”
“But…”
“No buts. Tell them about your skills so that they can cooperate at night.”
Liu Ziyang saw MO Xiu’s firm attitude and simply ignored him. He said to the others, “My skill, Afterimage, can turn into an afterimage and then appear anywhere within a five-meter radius of the original position. Within five seconds, I can activate the second part of the skill and turn into an afterimage again. Upgrade…”
“Wait! What did you say?”
MO Xiu interrupted Liu Ziyang and said in disbelief, “Your skill leveled up? Can it be activated automatically or can it be activated in the second stage?”
“Yeah, I’ve always wanted to tell you, but you didn’t give me a chance.””
MO Xiu stared straight at Liu Ziyang, causing Liu Ziyang’s hair to stand on end. “Boss, if you have something to say, say it. Don’t look at me like that.” “It’s simple. Just cooperate with me and put on a show.”
The few of them were stunned for a second before saying in unison, “I’ll listen to Director Mo’s arrangements!”
At 11:30 pm, MO Xiu appeared at Fan Street’s black market on time.
MO Xiu and the other two walked around. The big market that only appeared once every three days was indeed different. If it weren’t for the mission, they really wanted to plunder some things and go back.
After walking around, MO Xiu noticed that Wang Jinyang was observing him from the corner.
Moxiu found an opportunity and shouted, ‘”‘This is the black market on Fan
Street? Wasn’t that too bad? There’s nothing I want at all.”
He Lingyue comforted him,” What we’re looking for isn’t an ordinary thing. It’s possible that some stall owners have it but haven’t taken it out. How about this? Let’s split up and ask. ‘”‘
Moxiu sighed and said,” Alright, alright. I’ve waited for three days in this lousy place, but there’s nothing. ‘”‘
The three of them split up. Moxiu didn’t talk to the stall owner. Instead, he found an empty space to sit down and slack off.
Not long after, a hand was placed on Moxiu’s shoulder.
MO Xiu slapped it away and said,”Who is it?”
It was Wang Jinyang, who had been observing MO Xiu for a long time. Not only that night, but he had been paying attention to MO Xiu since he entered Fan Street.
Wang Jinyang had been on Fan Street for thirteen days. Every day, he would squat in the corner of Fan Street to observe the pedestrians.
MO Xiu’s arrogant and retarded behavior on Fan Street had attracted Wang Jinyang’s attention. After observing for three days, he felt that MO Xiu was the most suitable person to trade with.
Yesterday, he had heard from Liu Ziyang that his real name was Xiao Qing.
Wang Jinyang secretly checked and confirmed that he was indeed Xiao Qing. Only then did he feel relieved.
MO Xiu’s arrogant appearance did not make Wang Jinyang angry.
Wang Jinyang sat beside MO Xiu and said, ‘”‘Brother, I know you. Your name is Liu Neng.”
“Are you crazy?” MO Xiu cursed. What bullsh * t Liu Neng? His name was Xiao Qing.”
Even though MO Xiu was a little surprised by what he said, Wang Jinyang was really cautious. He was still testing the waters.
Wang Jinyang didn’t reply to MO Xiu’s words and continued, “”Xiao Qing, I know about your body’s flaws.”
“Who exactly are you?” MO Xiu asked angrily. I have no flaws.”
“Eh? Don’t worry, I have medicine that can cure your illness.”
Wang Jinyang knew that for a rich and powerful young master like Xiao Qing, as long as he could be cured, the elders in the family would be willing to pay no matter how much money they had. After all, they could not let the family be without descendants.
Therefore, he deliberately kept them in suspense and wanted to rip them off.
When Moxiu heard this, he quieted down and whispered,””You really have it? Let me tell you, I’m not easy to fool.”
Liu Jinyang didn’t say anything. He took out a box and opened it for MO Xiu to see.
When Moxiu saw what was inside, his eyes lit up.
“This… This was…Spirit Gathering Grass?”
“Brother, keep your voice down. If others hear you, they will all come to fight for this herb. I heard that you were suffering from a difficult situation and wanted to do you a favor.”
MO Xiu immediately covered his mouth and whispered,””How much is this?”
“You need this thing. You should know the price.”
“I bid 10 million!”
Wang Jinyang closed the box, hugged it in his arms, and got up to leave. MO Xiu quickly chased after Wang Jinyang and stopped him.
“Brother, do you think the price is suitable? Don’t go!”
Wang Jinyang looked like he didn’t want to talk about it anymore and said, “Go and find out what the market price is outside. This thing is priceless, and you’re offering 10 million? I don’t think you’re sincere in buying, so I’m not selling!”
Wang Jinyang walked around MO Xiu and left. “Thirty million!” Moxiu shouted from behind.”
“50 million!”
“100 million!”
Wang Jinyang stopped in his tracks..

                    



Chapter 54: A Good Show (2)

“100 million? Then we can still talk.”
“Brother, what’s your name?” MO Xiu asked with a pained expression. Let’s have a good talk. It’ll be difficult for me to take out 100 million yuan.”
Wang Jinyang thought for a moment. 100 million should be the other party’s limit. The energy contained in the Spirit Gathering Grass could reach the peak of the Spirit Rank.
However, it did not have the direct effect of the Spirit Ring, which could directly increase the level of a skill. Therefore, the price of the two was about the same. 100 million was also what Wang Jinyang had expected.
“There’s no need to ask for the name. The lowest price I can accept is 100 million. You know how popular this thing is. I’ll give you 10 seconds to consider.’
“Sure, sure, no problem!” Moxiu hurriedly said.” “I only want cash!”
“If it’s cash, I’ll need to discuss it with my people.””
Wang Jinyang sat on the ground and said, “Okay!” Hurry up.”
MO Xiu quickly found He Lingyue and Dong Fang. He started to talk to He Lingyue and occasionally looked in Wang Jinyang’s direction. After the conversation, He Lingyue walked toward Wang Jinyang.
“Big brother, can you let me see the treasure?”
Wang Jinyang didn’t mind. He opened the box and showed it to He Lingyue. “Big brother, can we discuss the price again?” He Lingyue said with a smile.”
Wang Jinyang looked at MO Xiu and said, “Brother Xiao Qing, your woman is bargaining with me. Didn’t we already talk about it?” Do you still want to listen to your woman? If you continue to dawdle like this, I won’t sell it anymore.”
When MO Xiu heard this, he rushed over and pulled He Lingyue behind him.
“I’ve discussed the price with this brother. It’s only 100 million, not a cent less.” Wang Jinyang snickered. This person was really an idiot.
He Lingyue was still unwilling to give up. She asked Wang Jinyang,”lf you want cash, how are you going to get so much money?”
“You’re willing to fork out 100 million yuan. You won’t mind giving me a car, right?” Wang Jinyang shrugged.”
He Lingyue said helplessly,” Okay, but we don’t have that much cash now. We need to go to the bank to withdraw it. It’s not very convenient to trade here.
You see…”
“I can wait for you to withdraw the money, but I have to decide the transaction location.”
“No problem. Where is it?” He Lingyue nodded. We’ll come and find you after we withdraw the money.”
“No, Xiao Qing must stay with me until the transaction is over. You two can go and withdraw the money.”
He Lingyue looked at Dong Fang and sighed.””Sigh! Alright, I’ll get the bodyguards to get the money. Xiao Qing and I will go with you.”
Wang Jinyang nodded and brought MO Xiu and He Lingyue to a mountain behind Fan Street.
There were very few trees on this mountain, and it was not steep. Anyone with slightly better driving skills could come up and drive away.
What caught MO Xiu’s attention the most was that there were no trees around the trading location that Wang Jinyang had chosen. It was an open area, and the ground was covered with hard soil without leaves.
In this place, once Wang Jinyang activated his invisibility, he would lose his trail and it would be very difficult to find him.
No wonder Wang Jinyang could escape unscathed after robbing the bank. He was reallv too cautious.
While waiting for the money, Wang Jinyang chatted with MO Xiu and He Lingyue.
“Brother Xiao Qing, how many years have you been sick? He was about to be cured. Tell me.”
MO Xiu shook his head and sighed.” Don’t mention it. How many years is it?” I was born like this.”
“I heard that you can perform surgery now. Is that not possible?” Wang Jinyang asked again.”
“Surgery? All of them are unreliable. If there’s no other way, can I look for medicine everywhere?”
Wang Jinyang said to He Lingyue,”By the way, sister, I still don’t know your name.””
He Lingyue was stunned for a moment and said, “My name is…”
“Hahaha, I found you. So you’re here.”
Wang Jinyang immediately turned to look at the source of the sound. He frowned.
“Why are you here? Do you want to die?”
It was Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren.
“You don’t want to live?” asked Liu Ziyang. I think you guys are the ones who don’t want to live anymore. When you asked about Xiao Qing’s information yesterday, I knew that you guys would definitely have a deal. I didn’t expect that there would really be a treasure.”
Wang Jinyang smiled and said, “I was wondering why I thought you two were acting weird yesterday. So you were waiting for me?””
MO Xiu angrily said to Wang Jinyang,””Brother, you actually investigated me?”
Wang Jinyang didn’t care.” It’s such a big business. Of course, I have to investigate. Don’t take offense. Let’s deal with these two first.”‘
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren had already attacked.
This was the plan of the meeting. In order to prevent Wang Jinyang from escaping with stealth skills, Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren disguised themselves as troublemakers.
Liu Ziyang used his skills to trick as many of Wang Jinyang’s skills as possible. The others pretended to be in a melee and were ready to surround him at any time to ensure that nothing went wrong.
Liu Ziyang went to Wang Jinyang while Hao Ren held MO Xiu and He Lingyue back.
“Fatty, if I’m not wrong, you just started university, right?” Wang Jinyang said disdainfully. You only have two skills at most, but I have four.”
Liu Ziyang was not to be outdone. Today, I’ll show you the difference in talent.”
Liu Ziyang took out his dagger and attacked directly. Wang Jinyang did not let his guard down at all and immediately used the skill Extreme Sword.
An energy longsword appeared in Wang Jinyang’s hand out of thin air. His combat strength increased drastically. With just two swords, Liu Ziyang was forced to retreat step by step.
After exchanging two more moves, Wang Jinyang said, “Why aren’t you using your skills? Let me see your talent?”
“Sure!” Liu Ziyang said with a smile.”
The sword landed on Liu Ziyang’s body. Just as Wang Jinyang thought the battle was over, Liu Ziyang disappeared into thin air, leaving behind an afterimage.
Wang Jinyang didn’t panic. He turned around and slashed at Liu Ziyang’s dagger.
This time, Wang Jinyang, who had the upper hand, was forced back two steps.
“I didn’t expect your reaction to be so fast. Again!” Liu Ziyang said.”
The battle continued. Wang Jinyang could clearly feel that Liu Ziyang’s speed had increased. He used his speed advantage to dodge
The power of the Bursting Flames was not small. What Wang Jinyang did not expect was that Liu Ziyang disappeared again, leaving behind an afterimage.
Wang Jinyang gritted his teeth. This fatty was actually so difficult to deal with.
Liu Ziyang once again appeared behind Wang Jinyang and was seen through by Wang Jinyang.
The two of them entered a stalemate.
MO Xiu and Hao Ren were fighting back and forth. In fact, he had been observing Liu Ziyang and Wang Jinyang’s movements and was ready to provide support at any time.
On the surface, He Lingyue was helping MO Xiu and Wang Jinyang, but in fact, she had been maintaining a distance of three meters between herself and Wang Jinyang.
The one who broke the deadlock was not anyone present, but Dong Fang, who drove over.
Dong Fang got off the car and headed straight for the battlefield. The first to support him was MO Xiu.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang attacked together and quickly forced Hao Ren back. Seeing that the situation was not good, Hao Ren ran to Liu Ziyang’s side.
Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren met up and attacked Wang Jinyang together. Wang Jinyang looked at MO Xiu and the others who were heading toward him.
Unfortunately, Wang Jinyang could not wait for reinforcements and was forced into a desperate situation. He could only use Stealth.
At the same time, the five members of the Strongest Club had already formed an encirclement.
In front of them were Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren, on the left was He Lingyue, and on the right was Dong Fang.
If nothing unexpected happened, Wang Jinyang would distance himself from the enemy and run backwards to face the strongest MO Xiu!

                    



Chapter 55: A Good Show (2)

Wang Jinyang activated his fourth skill, Stealth, and disappeared without a trace.
MO Xiu and the others all looked at He Lingyue. If nothing unexpected happened, Wang Jinyang would decide where to go next before he turned invisible.
He Lingyue was within three meters of Wang Jinyang, so she should have known where he was going.
Moxiu was on high alert, because it was most likely that they would come to his side.
However, He Lingyue pointed in a direction that no one had expected. It was the gap between Dong Fang and Liu Ziyang.
Dong Fang and MO Xiu’s reactions were the fastest. Dong Fang directly used his skill Golden Body to block that position.
Moxiu activated the Descent of the War God and charged in that direction.
“Bang!” Something bumped into Dong Fang. It seemed that the timing was just right. Wang Jinyang just happened to bump into Dong Fang.
At this moment, everyone reacted and immediately narrowed the encirclement, leaving Wang Jinyang nowhere to go.
MO Xiu stretched out his right hand. Due to the limited space, he grabbed Wang Jinyang’s arm.
“Wang Jinyang, when did you find out?” MO Xiu asked.”
Wang Jinyang didn’t run in Moxiu’s direction, which was enough to show that he had already noticed something amiss. He didn’t want to continue the transaction and wanted to escape immediately.
This scene was quite strange. MO Xiu spoke to the air, and another voice appeared out of thin air.
“From the moment your little girlfriend couldn’t say her name, the two of you didn’t use any skills during the battle. At that time, I was sure that I had fallen into a trap.”
He Lingyue lowered her head in embarrassment. She really didn’t expect Wang Jinyang to suddenly ask for her name. She paused for a moment.
It seems like we were careless,” MO Xiu said.” But you’ve been captured. Show yourself.’”‘ “I can show my true form, but I have two questions to ask.”
“What?”
“With the strength of the five of you, why didn’t you just capture me? Why are you putting on this show?”
“Make sure everything goes well. There will be several chances to capture him during this period, but you are too cautious.”
“Don’t you know my skill? Who asked you to arrest me?”
MO Xiu finally realized that Wang Jinyang’s question was not out of unwillingness.
This was still a test, a test to see if his skill had been exposed, and a test to see who wanted to capture him.
Moxiu didn’t reply, instead saying solemnly,”Quickly reveal your true form, or I won’t be polite to you!”
MO Xiu tightened his grip, and Jin Yang immediately cried out in pain.
“Ah! Ah! Kid, I’ll remember you. We’ll settle our scores in the future!”
Without any warning, MO Xiu loosened his grip. Wang Jinyang suddenly broke free from MO Xiu’s grip and crashed into Dong Fang again.
He had been careless. Moxiu had been restricted by his fixed thinking. He had originally thought that Wang Jinyang would immediately use Stab to escape after using Stealth.
He didn’t expect Wang Jinyang to be so cunning. He deliberately waited for the five people to shrink back before using the Stab. This way, he could directly break through the encirclement.
Moxiu knew that it might be too late to chase after them now. He had an idea and immediately reacted.
MO Xiu took a step forward in the direction that Wang Jinyang had fled to. At this moment, Dong Fang, who was trying to get up, was once again pressed to the ground by MO Xiu.
Just like that, MO Xiu pressed his left hand on Dong Fang’s body while his right hand took out the Black Kirin. He aimed in Wang Jinyang’s direction and gripped the hilt of his sword tightly.
The black kylin instantly extended. MO Xiu might not be able to catch up to Wang Jinyang, but the black kylin could!
“Puchi! ”
Black Kirin had pierced through Wang Jinyang. MO Xiu guessed that it was
Wang Jinyang’s abdomen. This was the first time Black Kirin had seen blood.
Liu Ziyang and the others were shocked by this scene. A dagger that could bounce out like a bullet?
He Lingyue was the most shocked. When MO Xiu bought the scabbard, she had looked at it the most carefully. At that time, she thought it was just an ordinary dagger. She didn’t expect it to be so magical.
MO Xiu saw that everyone was stunned on the spot and said helplessly, “What are you guys doing? Go and catch Wang Jinyang.”
By the time they realized that Wang Jinyang was too weak, his body had already slowly revealed itself.
MO Xiu recalled the black Kirin and walked forward to check.
Wang Jinyang lay on the ground and looked at MO Xiu with a pale face.
“You win,” she said weakly.
“I still lost in terms of the setup. I almost let you escape. ‘”‘
Wang Jinyang suddenly laughed maniacally, completely disregarding his injuries.
“Hahaha, you have more trump cards than me, so you win. There was no such thing as a perfect setup in this world. There was only a perfect breaker!”
MO Xiu didn’t answer Wang Jinyang because he didn’t Imow how to answer.
After Wang Jinyang finished speaking, he probably fainted due to excessive blood loss.
Moxiu began to arrange the work.
“Hao Ren, Dong Fang, you two help him stop the bleeding and carry him to the car. Liu Ziyang, you contact the law enforcement team.”
The three of them got busy after receiving the order. He Lingyue leaned over and asked,”What about me? What should I do?”
MO Xiu picked up the box on the ground and said, “Let’s discuss what to do with this Spirit Gathering Grass.’”‘
“What do you want?” He Lingyue asked with a smile. Hand it over or keep it for yourself?”
“I’m inclined to stay. There won’t be many rewards even if I hand it over.”
“Then what’s there to discuss?” asked He Lingyue. I agree with you.”
“I mean, how should we split this?””
“How do you want to split it?”
“I want this grass!”
He Lingyue thought for a moment and said,” You’re the commander of this mission and the one who contributed the most. I have no objections. You can ask the others.”
MO Xiu saw that the other three were busy and shook his head. “Let’s talk about it after things are settled.”
MO Xiu walked to the car. He Lingyue caught up and whispered,’”‘Mo Xiu, how did you know that Wang Jinyang could turn invisible?”
MO Xiu paused for a moment and turned to He Lingyue.””Wang Jinyang can turn invisible. Didn’t we discuss the worst-case scenario during the meeting?” He Lingyue looked at MO Xiu meaningfully for a while before speaking. “All the plans were for Wang Jinyang to become invisible. You’re so rigorous.”
MO Xiu slapped his thigh and said,”Aiya, I really didn’t think of that. Look!”
This is what I lack in the first place.”
“Also, how can you be sure that Liu Ziyang can hold Wang Jinyang back with his skills?” He Lingyue asked. You’re not the kind of person who doesn’t care about the safety of his teammates, right?”
After listening to He Lingyue’s words, MO Xiu’s expression was painful. He was just short of tears.
“This is indeed my mistake. I didn’t consider this point. I only considered that Liu Ziyang could Flash twice.”
He Lingyue wanted to continue, but MO Xiu interrupted,””Also… And the last mistake just now caused Wang Jinyang to almost run away. Sigh! This mission has exposed so many of my shortcomings. Next time, you can command!”
He Lingyue was confused by MO Xiu’s words. She pointed at her nose and said, “Me? What should I command? I want to ask…
MO Xiu interrupted again,” It seems like I’m not cut out to be a commander.
You’re more comprehensive than me. You can try commanding next time. Maybe you’ll have better results.’”‘
“I don’t want to, I…”
“Alright, let’s go back! He had gone back! Hand Wang Jinyang over to the Law Enforcement Team, and we’ll split the money…”
MO Xiu said as he walked away, leaving He Lingyue alone, stomping her feet in anger.
“Humph! Movie King MO!”

                    



Chapter 56: Do You Think I’m Annoying?

The next morning, they returned to school after handing Wang Jinyang over to the law enforcement team.
He didn’t return to his dorm and went straight to the activity room of the strongest club.
The mission had been completed, and the reward had been transferred into Moxiu’s account. Moxiu distributed the rewards according to the distribution method they had discussed earlier.
Then, he took out the Spirit Gathering Grass and a big bag and placed them on the table.
Moxiu said to the crowd,” These are the spoils of war that we obtained this time. The mission stated that if we hand them in, we can obtain additional rewards. If we don’t hand them in, these will be our rewards. Let’s vote. Those who choose to hand them in raise their hands.”
Only Dong Fang raised his hand. Everyone looked at him in surprise.
Dong Fang noticed that something was wrong with their gazes and asked,”Why are you looking at me like that? The money that Wang Jinyang robbed from the bank must be returned to the bank.”
Liu Ziyang helped to explain,” Big brother, you’re mistaken. We accepted the that the Dark Shadow is a relatively independent supervision department. Once something reaches the Dark Shadow, it basically won’t be returned.”
” That’s right,” He Lingyue added.” That’s why the mission didn’t specify what to do with the spirit-gathering grass. ‘”‘
Dong Fang thought for a while before he figured it out.
“I understand. You mean that although this thing is stolen, it was already legal when it was in our hands. When the law enforcement team handed the mission to An Ying, they didn’t want to find the lost item, right?”
Everyone, including MO Xiu, was somewhat surprised. Dong Fang had actually used his brain. Not only did he use his brain, but he had also thought it through very clearly.
” That’s right,” Moxiu said.” The choice now is whether to exchange for the reward or not.””
” I don’t have any idea yet,” Hao Ren asked.” Will the reward be greater than the value of these things?””
Liu Ziyang pursed his lips and said, “According to Shadow’s usual style, it’s very difficult!””
“Of course not, ” Dong Fang and Hao Ren said together.”
Alright,” Moxiu said.” Since you’re not handing it over, let’s discuss the distribution. Let me say this first. I really want this herb.”‘
Liu Ziyang had a strange look in his eyes. He smiled and said, “Boss, in this mission and the previous mission, you said that you had a problem in that area, right…? Is there really such a disease?”
Hearing this, Hao Ren and Dong Fang looked at MO Xiu strangely, and even He Lingyue stole glances at him.
This made Moxiu feel very awkward. He hurriedly explained, “Don’t talk nonsense. There’s no such thing. Both times were required for missions.”
Hao Ren said generously,” It doesn’t matter. I’m not sick. Boss said that you can have the spirit-gathering herb. I have no objections.””
Liu Ziyang also said,”Ah, yes, Boss. I have no objections. What about you?” Dong Fang! ”
Dong Fang immediately shook his head. He Lingyue looked at MO Xiu with some sympathy and said, “I have no objections. MO Xiu, the Spirit Gathering
Grass is yours.”
The situation was out of control. Even if Xio explained now, it would be useless.
She could only glare at Liu Ziyang.
Liu Ziyang saw that the situation was not good and stood up to leave.
“Um, Boss, I still have to attend the inter-class competition later. I’ll be leaving first.”
Seeing that Liu Ziyang was about to leave, the others all bid their farewells and wanted to leave to avoid making things awkward for MO Xiu.
“Wait a minute, we haven’t finished distributing the loot yet,” Moxiu said helplessly.”
The four of them stopped in their tracks and looked at MO Xiu. Why hadn’t they finished distributing the loot? Didn’t they just obtain a Spirit Gathering Grass this time?
Moxiu pointed at the bag on the table and said,””Before handing Wang Jinyang over to the law enforcement team, I searched his things and found a key to the Fan Street Hotel. While you were busy, I went to the hotel alone and got this bag.”
No one was stupid. If the bag that Wang Jinyang had hidden in the hotel wasn’t money, what else could it be?
The few of them came over to look at MO Xiu. MO Xiu opened the bag and saw that it was filled with hundred-yuan bills. Without counting, he knew that there should be a few million.
MO Xiu continued,” I took the Spirit Gathering Grass. I don’t want you guys to split the money. In addition, I still have some savings. I’ve transferred two million to each of your accounts.’”‘
Hearing MO Xiu’s words, the few of them didn’t hold back and started to count the numbers, preparing to split them.
Moxiu wasn’t very generous because the value of the Spirit Gathering Grass was too high. Wang Jinyang’s asking price was 100 million, which was definitely not very high. The market price was around this price. Even the black market wouldn’t be less than 80 million.
Moxiu gave each of them two million yuan, a total of eight million yuan. Adding on the money that he was given, he bought the herb for just over ten million yuan.
At this price, it was likely impossible to buy it anywhere else. Moxiu had actually gotten a huge bargain.
After a short while, the money was distributed and everyone left happily.
Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang went to participate in the inter-class competition while He Lingyue went back to her dorm to rest. After all, she had been staying up late for the past three days and hadn’t had a good rest.
Only Dong Fang and MO Xiu were left. Dong Fang’s family was already in a difficult situation, perhaps even more so than MO Xiu’s. He was a little excited to have earned so much money.
“Moxiu, what are we going to do now?”
“Let’s go back and rest too. We’ll take a nap first and see if there are any new missions at night. ‘”‘
When Dong Fang heard that there was a new mission, his eyes lit up and he kept nodding.
The two of them went to the bank first. Dong Fang couldn’t wait to deposit the money and send it to his mother.
Looking at Dong Fang, MO Xiu thought of his mother, Li Yuan.
He had been here for so many days, but he had not called his mother. He had only told her that he was safe when he first arrived at school.
While waiting for Dong Fang, MO Xiu called Li Yuan.
His mother was still as easy-going as ever. He could tell that she missed him a lot, but she did not express it.
Her mother was going to work in the next few days, and everything was going well.
After hanging up, Moxiu also checked his balance. He only had less than a million left.
The expenses during this period were relatively large. Buying a house, plus the eight million he had just given, and the one million he had left for his mother when he left Shun City.
Now, it could be said that he did not have much money left after returning to his original state overnight. It seemed that he had to take on a few more missions to earn some money.
Dong Fang had also saved his money, but the big guy actually cried.
“What’s wrong?” asked MO Xiu.
Dong Fang cried and said,”Just now…” Mother… When I called, my mom said that I…lf he was successful and could earn money, his family would not have to suffer… The days passed. My mother cried, and so did I.”
MO Xiu could empathize with Dong Fang’s feelings. He comforted Dong Fang all the way back to the dormitory.
Once he returned to his room, Moxiu immediately fell asleep. He had expended a lot of energy in the past three days. Whether it was his body or his brain, he needed a good rest.
In the evening, Moxiu was woken up by his phone ringing.
“Hello?”
“MO Xiu, what illness are you suffering from? Is it serious?”
“Zheng Yi? What illness do I have?”
MO Xiu looked at the time. It was only five in the afternoon. “Don’t hide the truth from me. If there’s anything, just say it.” “Alright, I’m quite tired. I’ll sleep first. I’m fine. Bye!”
“MO Xiu! MO Xiu…
MO Xiu hung up and wanted to continue sleeping, but his phone rang again. MO Xiu picked up the phone and said, “I already said I’m fine. Aren’t you annoyed?’”‘
“MO Xiu? Do you find me annoying?”
Hearing this voice, MO Xiu immediately woke up. He glanced at the phone, it was Mu Qingyi.
“Ah, Qingyi? I thought it was Zheng Yi. Why? You suddenly called.”
The other end of the phone was silent for a while before MO Xiu asked a shocking question.
“MO Xiu, are you really sick in that area?”
Moxiu reacted to the question for a second.

                    



Chapter 57: Spirit Gathering Grass

‘ Ah?!!”
Mu Qingyi asked, “What’s wrong with the other two?” What happened?” “Qingyi, who did you hear that from? There’s no such thing.”
“Liu Ziyang’s Moments. Is he really fine?”
MO Xiu assured: Of course it’s okay, Liu Ziyang is talking nonsense, I have to find him to talk.”
“Haha, alright then. It’s fine.”
“Qingyi, are you really concerned about this?” MO Xiu asked strangely.”
“No, I was afraid that you were sick, so I called to ask you. If you make fun of me like this, I won’t ask again.” “Is that really the case?”
“Alright… I have something to do here. Bye!”
Mu Qingyi quickly hung up the phone, and MO Xiu looked at the phone and laughed foolishly.
After being disturbed by the continuous calls, MO Xiu no longer felt sleepy.
Recalling Mu Qingyi’s words just now, he scrolled through his Moments.
Liu Ziyang: ” Boss really has that kind of illness. Sigh, I pray that Boss can be cured cured.”
MO Xiu was furious. Not only did Liu Ziyang spread rumors, but he also posted it on his Moments to announce it to the world.
Even MO Xiu couldn’t take it anymore and gave Liu Ziyang a call.
“Hello? Boss, what’s wrong? Is there a new mission?”
“Nothing, I just wanted to talk to you. I’ll see you at the fifth training field.”
“What? Now?”
“Right now!”
MO Xiu hung up the phone. Liu Ziyang was a little puzzled. Martial arts field number five?
When Liu Ziyang arrived at the training grounds, he discovered that MO Xiu was already waiting there.
“Boss, what did you want to talk to me about? Why did you choose this place?”
“Let’s go. I’ve booked a private room for practicing martial arts. Let’s go in and talk.
After MO Xiu finished speaking, he walked in front of him. Liu Ziyang followed
him in a daze.
Liu Ziyang only realized that something was wrong when MO Xiu locked the door.
“Boss, what are you doing?”
Moxiu said with a kind smile,’”‘lt’s nothing. It’s been a long time since the two of us sparred, right? This time, the old and new scores were all together…No, since our skills have leveled up, we should spar.”
Liu Ziyang swallowed his saliva and took a step back.”Boss, there’s no need to spar. I can’t beat you. I admit defeat, okay?”
“That’s not right. Have you forgotten the first lesson that Teacher Wang Lei taught us? We aren’t afraid of strong enemies. The two of us sparring is to learn from each other. Where did the idea of admitting defeat come from?”
Liu Ziyang wanted to continue declining, but MO Xiu didn’t give him the chance. He immediately activated the Descent of the Martial God and charged at Liu Ziyang.
He suddenly stopped halfway, making Liu Ziyang extremely nervous.
“You prefer to use daggers. Shall we compete with weapons?” Moxiu stopped and said.
Liu Ziyang shook his head in fear as the image of the terrifying Black Qilin that pierced through Wang Jinyang appeared in his mind.
“Oh, then let’s begin.”
Under the buff of the Descent of the Martial God, MO Xiu’s speed was extremely fast. Even Liu Ziyang, who was known for his speed, could not compare to him.
In an instant, he arrived in front of Liu Ziyang and punched his face. Liu Ziyang could only activate his skill, Afterimage, to dodge.
Liu Ziyang didn’t appear behind MO Xiu, but rather appeared in the distance. It wasn’t that Liu Ziyang didn’t want to attack, but he had experienced MO Xiu’s inhuman reaction speed. If he were to launch a sneak attack, he would definitely be beaten up.
“Boss, are you serious?” Liu Ziyang said after he appeared.”
Moxiu didn’t reply and continued to attack.
Liu Ziyang, who had received the skill buff, was much faster. He now had the leeway to deal with Moxiu.
However, it was only two moves. How terrifying was MO Xiu’s actual combat? That was something that even Wang Lei was a little afraid of.
Liu Ziyang was an Assassin. An Assassin was fighting a Warrior in close combat. Moreover, he did not even have the advantage in speed. There was no way to fight.
The third move forced out Liu Ziyang’s second skill. This time, Liu Ziyang appeared near the door.
That’s right! Liu Ziyang didn’t want to continue this unfair sparring session and wanted to escape.
However, how could MO Xiu give him such a chance? He quickly caught up to Liu Ziyang and punched him.
Liu Ziyang staggered from the blow, and then faced MO Xiu’s storm-like punches.
“Boss, I admit defeat?” “What is it? You still want to fight? Good!”
“No! I said I admit defeat!”
“What? You still want to continue? Alright!”
Five minutes later, Liu Ziyang was sprawled on the ground with his hands on his head. MO Xiu stood at the side with his hands on his hips.
“Boss, tell me, how did I offend you?” Liu Ziyang said weakly.”
“Stop spreading rumors about me being sick, do you hear me?”
Liu Ziyang raised three fingers and said,”l, Liu Ziyang, swear that I will keep the secret for Boss.”
MO Xiu’s face instantly darkened. What did he mean by keeping a secret?
He twisted his neck and gave him another round of beating.
Liu Ziyang’s scream echoed throughout the private room. “Ah! Boss, I’ve already sworn, ah! What else do you want me to do?”
At night, MO Xiu returned to his dorm after his exercise.
Now, regardless of whether Liu Ziyang believed that he was not sick, he would not continue to spread rumors.
He opened Liu Ziyang’s Moments and found that the post had been deleted. MO Xiu smiled in satisfaction.
The next thing to do was to take the medicine. He had not eaten the precious Spirit Gathering Grass yet.
The value of the Spirit Gathering Grass might not be as high as the Spirit Ring in the eyes of some people, but it was extremely useful for Moxiu.
Moxiu persisted in training, but he realized that his strength and speed had not improved for a long time. It was as if he had reached a bottleneck.
This question had troubled MO Xiu for a few days, until he saw the Spirit Gathering Grass.
Little MO Xiu had never eaten any herbs since he was young. He had only been able to reach his current physical strength because he had put in more effort than others.
Hard work could determine the speed of a person’s development, and potential was the deciding factor in determining the height of development.
After so many years of hard work, Moxiu had used up all of his potential. No matter how hard he trained, it would be very difficult for him to improve further.
The only way was to increase his body’s potential and increase his upper limit.
Due to the War God’s Descent, the better Moxiu’s base was, the stronger his skills would be.
That was why MO Xiu was determined to get the Spirit Gathering Grass this time.
MO Xiu had searched the internet for many ways to consume the Spirit Gathering Grass. In the end, he came to the conclusion that the main effect of the Spirit Gathering Grass was that it contained a large amount of energy and could completely change one’s physique. The best way was to swallow it whole, because any method used to process it would cause energy loss.
What was even more ridiculous was that there was a detailed comparison on the Internet between swallowing the Spirit Gathering Grass in one mouthful and eating it in two portions. They calculated the amount of energy that would be lost. MO Xiu couldn’t understand it, but he felt that it was very impressive.
MO Xiu looked at the fist-sized Spirit Gathering Grass and felt a headache. How was he going to swallow it?
After playing chess with the Spirit Gathering Grass for half an hour, MO Xiu made up his mind and grabbed the Spirit Gathering Grass and stuffed it into his mouth.
MO Xiu endured the pain and stuffed the Spirit Gathering Grass into his mouth. He felt as if the corner of his mouth was about to tear.
She tried to close her mouth, but she realized that she couldn’t close it no matter what. She could only cover her mouth with her hands.
He chewed with difficulty in his mouth and only swallowed after a while.
Taste? It was no different from eating grass. A bitter taste rose from his heart to the tip of his tongue.
Not long after, he felt a warm sensation in his abdomen. MO Xiu sat cross-legged and closed his eyes to feel the warmth. He tried his best to guide the warmth to flow through his entire body.
This process was very long. When Moxiu felt the warmth disappear and opened his eyes, it was already nine o’clock the next morning.
After checking his body, he found that other than his skin getting better, there were no other changes.
Moxiu sighed.” The novels say that removing the impurities in the body will expel a lot of filth. I even deliberately meditated on the ground to avoid dirtying the bedsheets.. It seems like they were all lies!!”

                    



Chapter 58: Upgrade (1)

MO Xiu walked out of the room and realized that Dong Fang wasn’t there. He didn’t know what he had gone out to do.
After looking around, they found that there was nothing to eat. Some of them were hungry, so they had to go to the canteen by themselves.
Coincidentally, he bumped into Xiao Hong at the entrance of the cafeteria. MO Xiu wanted to greet her, but just as he raised his right hand, he wanted to say hello.
Xiao Hong’s sharp gaze swept past MO Xiu and she walked past him with quick steps. When she reached MO Xiu’s side, she snorted coldly.
MO Xiu’s right hand froze, After Xiao Hong walked past, he scratched his head awkwardly.
Why was this woman so domineering? He couldn’t possibly vent his anger on her just because he had a grudge against Liu Ziyang, right?
Moxiu shook his head and walked into the cafeteria to have a simple bite. Then, he rushed to the No. 5 training field.
There were 15 training grounds in the entire Yan Jing University. MO Xiu loved this number five, not because of anything else, but because it was the cheapest training ground in the entire university.
The other venues were different. Some had advanced equipment, while others were similar to the helmet simulation venues used during the college entrance examination.
It was said that the best simulation field could simulate a perfect opponent, which could help students improve even more than actual combat. However, the price was naturally not cheap.
Moxiu also wanted to see it, but with the current economic strength…
After entering Martial Arts Field No. 5, MO Xiu went to the front desk and rented a private room for the physical assessment.
In fact, the hall of every stadium was free of charge. However, out of consideration for keeping a low profile and measuring accuracy, Moxiu still chose a private room.
He took the key and entered the private room. This private room was the most ordinary. The facilities inside were very simple. There were props for training strength, a special treadmill, and instruments for measuring strength and speed.
Moxiu wasn’t in a hurry to measure it. He first stood on the treadmill and started running.
This was to adapt to the body’s sudden increase in physique. Only after the whole body could coordinate and exert strength could the test be carried out. Only then could the real data be tested.
Moxiu first ran at his usual speed, then slowly increased his speed, getting faster and faster.
He hadn’t reached full speed yet, and the treadmill was already unable to keep up with Moxiu’s speed.
Moxiu walked off the treadmill in disappointment. It seemed like he would have to rent a better room if he wanted to train in the future.
Since he could not force himself to his limit, he could only brace himself and test it.
The first was the speed test. Moxiu had used his full strength this time, and his coordination was quite good. He should be able to get a more accurate number.
4-988s
In the past, Moxiu would not even dare to think of reaching a hundred meters in less than five seconds. He never expected a single herb to have such a huge improvement.
If that was the case, MO Xiu knew that there would be a huge gap between him and a true genius.
A truly big family would have endless resources from a young age. They might not care about the results of the college entrance examination and would directly be specially recruited by the university, or they might not even go to university at all and would be better off staying in the family.
Next was the strength test. Moxiu followed the previous method of exerting strength and focused all his strength on his fist.
The strength test wasn’t as smooth as the speed test. The first time he exerted force, he wasn’t complete.
425-786kg
Moxiu frowned. Compared to his speed, his strength didn’t increase much. Again!
“Bang!”
457-325kg
He was a little better, but he was still not in his best condition.
“Bang!”
487-352kg Again! “Bang! Bang! Bang!”
503.254kg
After another dozen punches, his punch strength finally exceeded 500kg. Moxiu smiled in satisfaction.
At this moment, someone knocked on the door of the private room and a voice came from outside.
“Students inside, don’t use too much testing equipment. If you want to train, don’t you have training equipment inside?”
Only then did MO Xiu react. He had already tested it dozens of times.
“I’m sorry, I forgot for a while.”
He didn’t hear any response. The patrol must have left after warning him.
The improvement this time was huge. With his current physical strength and the descent of the Martial God, MO Xiu was confident that he could fight Wang Lei to a draw.
After eating the Spirit Gathering Grass, his potential should have increased. MO Xiu was most happy that he could continue to improve.
Moxiu wanted to continue training, but he gave up after looking at the training equipment in the room. These equipment were not enough to support his training, so he could only give up.
He had to find a way to earn money. Even the simplest private room like this cost 1,000 yuan a day.
MO Xiu walked out of Martial Arts Field No. 5 and went straight back to his dormitory. He realized that Dong Fang had not returned yet.
He took out his phone and started to study the mission. After lying down, he felt something pressing against him. After feeling what it was, Moxiu slapped his head. How could he have forgotten about this?
What he touched was the pistol he had bought from the black market. MO Xiu had never seen a firearm firearm before, so he didn’t know how lethal this pistol was. He decided to give it a try.
MO Xiu arrived at the back of the mountain alone and pulled the trigger.”No reaction?
After studying it for a while, he still couldn’t use it. Moxiu was a little angry. This shop owner was scamming him. This was completely fake. He thought that he had discovered something incredible.
MO Xiu threw it onto the ground. He used quite a bit of strength, and the pistol hit the rock.”.
Moxiu heard the strange sound and picked it up again. He leaned his face forward and casually pulled the trigger.
“Bang!”
The bullet brushed past Moxiu’s face.
Moxiu looked at the pistol with lingering fear. Fortunately, it was not aimed at him just now. Otherwise, he would have died young.
After studying it for a while, he realized that a pistol needed to be loaded before it could be used.
MO Xiu still wanted to continue testing the power of the pistol, but it was a little inconvenient for him. After thinking for a moment, he still called Dong Fang over.
After Dong Fang went up the mountain, he jogged all the way to MO Xiu.
“MO Xiu, what’s wrong? When I woke up this morning, I saw that you weren’t awake yet, so I went out to find my former classmates for dinner.” “Do you remember this?” MO Xiu handed the pistol to Dong Fang.”
“I remember. I bought it from the black market. What did you say it was? Firearms?
MO Xiu retreated more than ten meters and said,”Come on!”
“Ah?” Dong Fang was stunned. What did this mean?
MO Xiu activated the Descent of the Martial God and taught Dong Fang how to load the gun.
“Boss, are we really aiming at you? What if you can’t dodge it?”
“Cut the crap. Hurry up and aim!”
Moxiu’s attention was highly focused as he stared at the muzzle of the gun.
“Bang!”
The bullets flew out, and Moxiu reacted to the limit. The moment he saw the bullets appear, he started to move.
After dodging the bullet, MO Xiu fell into deep thought while Dong Fang was stunned.
After a while, Dong Cai finally reacted and asked, “Mo Xiu, your reaction is so fast? If it were me, I definitely wouldn’t be able to dodge it. This thing is too scary.”
“I did a rough calculation. I still had some energy left for the ten meters distance just now. If I were to suddenly be shot within three meters, I would definitely be hit without being prepared.”
“D * mn, why don’t we hand him over? It’s too dangerous.”
“Come, shoot at me again and see how powerful it is,” said Moxiu.”
With the previous test, Dong Fang quickly got into the zone and fired a shot at MO Xiu.
This time, after Moxiu dodged the bullet, his right hand turned into a knife and slashed at the bullet.
However, the bullet was still too fast, and it brushed past MO Xiu’s palm.
MO Xiu raised his right hand. He was injured, although it was only a light injury.
However, this was Moxiu’s defense when he activated his skill. Even with all his attributes increased by 300%, he would still be injured.
It was a little scary to think about it. When a skill was activated, an ordinary person could assassinate him..

                    



Chapter 59: Inner-faculty Selection Competition
If an ordinary pistol could have such lethality, what about other weapons?
Moxiu finally understood why the Alliance banned firearms.
The lethality of firearms to wild beasts was limited, but it was a great threat to humans.
During the period of civil strife, there must be some people who wanted to use firearms to rule the entire human race.
In order to preserve powerful humans to deal with wild beasts, the Alliance had no choice but to ban firearms.
MO Xiu took the pistol from Dong Fang’s hand. Such a weapon might not be able to cause any harm to a warrior like him, but it was definitely very easy to deal with ordinary people, including his mother, Li Yuan.
At the thought of this, Moxiu could no longer remain calm. He took out his phone, opened the Shadow app, and chose to create a mission, Firearms Investigation!
Since they had decided to investigate this matter, MO Xiu and Dong Fang returned to Fan Street’s black market that night to investigate.
The result was shocking. Almost every stall owner had firearms at different prices. All of them were handguns, and they were exactly the same as the one in Moxiu’s hand.
When asked about the source, everyone’s answer was surprisingly consistent. One night, they picked it up when they entered the black market. Everyone who saw it at that time received a handful.
This wasn’t a secret, and Moxiu didn’t spend much effort to find out where the guns were found.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang hurried to the place. There was indeed a large cloth bag that had been torn apart and scattered all over the ground. However, there was nothing unusual in other places. This place was not accessible even by car.
“Let’s split up and look around. Pay attention to the details of the surroundings.”
Dong Fang knew that this was no small matter, so he nodded seriously. “Good!”
An hour later, the two met again.
“How is it?” MO Xiu asked.
Dong Fang shook his head.
MO Xiu sighed.” Sigh, the clues are gone. Those stall owners didn’t seem to be lying, but there are no clues here. There are no traces around. Could it be that this pistol came from the sky?””
As Moxiu spoke, he raised his head to look at the sky. For some reason, the Demon Hawk’s figure flashed across his mind.
Shaking his head, he said, “How can 1?””
“What did you say, MO Xiu?” asked Dong Fang. What should we do now?”
“The clues are broken. Let’s go back first!”
“After a day of trouble today, this matter is over?”
“It’s not over. No matter who put the gun here, they must have a purpose. Let’s wait and see what this person wants to do next!”
July 16th. Today was the fifteenth day of school, and also the day of the faculty selection.
In the ten days after the investigation of firearms was fruitless, Moxiu contacted the other members of the Strongest Society and prepared to accept another mission.
Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang were at the critical stage of the inter-class competition, and they didn’t want to be affected.
He Lingyue couldn’t follow the mission because of her personal matters, so only MO Xiu and Dong Fang were left.
The number of missions that the two of them could take on was much lower, and Moxiu wasn’t going to force them. He would take on a D rank or a C rank
mission with lower difficulty every day.
After completing the mission, Moxiu would still have free time to train.
The past ten days had been very fulfilling, and he had accumulated some wealth. All the points belonged to MO Xiu, and most of the cash was given to Dong Fang. However, MO Xiu still had more than four million in his bank account.
In private room number one of training field number three.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang had arrived early. Today was the day of the faculty selection. After half a month, they could finally continue the competition.
All the five members of the strongest club, except for Hao Ren, entered the selection.
Hao Ren was upset for a few days and complained to Moxiu. Moxiu was annoyed and gave Hao Ren a task to recruit the sixth member of the strongest club. The requirement was… A contestant who had advanced to the inter-faculty competition.
This requirement greatly increased the difficulty. Generally, such experts had already been absorbed by the major clubs. Even if there were some independent people, why would they come to the strongest club, which only had five people?
Hao Ren knew that it would be difficult, but he had something to do, so he didn’t bother MO Xiu anymore.
Because the venue was very big and there were many people, MO Xiu and Dong Fang walked around a few times before they noticed He Lingyue and Class President Mumu.
Mu Mu had not seen MO Xiu and Dong Fang for a long time, so he greeted them warmly.
“You two are here? Lingyue and I have been looking for you.”
MO Xiu said,” We’re also looking for you. The time is up, but the teacher hasn’t arrived yet. We don’t know which teacher is more unreliable than our form teacher.””
Mu Mu covered her mouth and said with a smile, “Mo Xiu, didn’t you see the list at the door?””
MO Xiu shook his head and looked at Dong Fang. Dong Fang still had that simple and honest look on his face as he spread his hands, indicating that he didn’t know.
He Lingyue sighed and said,”The person in charge of the selection is our class teacher, Teacher Cao Fenglin.””
MO Xiu was stunned for a moment.” That’s not right. At the inter-class competition, from Teacher Cao’s tone, she shouldn’t be in charge of the selection within the faculty. ‘”‘
The few of them looked at Mu Mu, thinking that this class monitor would know something.
Mu Mu said innocently,” Don’t look at me. I’m the same as you. I haven’t seen my teacher in half a month. “‘
Several people are talking about the time when the sound of the door comes from the door.
“Cough cough, everyone, split up into groups according to your class. Class One, stand at the front and line up in order.”
Who else could this lazy voice be but Cao Fenglin?
MO Xiu looked over and saw Cao Fenglin holding a megaphone and speaking to everyone.
After everyone reacted for a second, the students of Class One took the lead and stood at the front. The others stood in line according to their class and soon formed a neat line.
Cao Fenglin spoke into the loudspeaker,” I received the notice at the last minute. I’m in charge of the selection. Some of you should have heard of the selection methods used in the past. However, I’m the one organizing this time.
We’ll have to do it my way.””
Everyone was silent as they listened carefully to the rules of the competition.
“11 tnere are no omectlons, 1 Will take It tnat you agree witn my rules. my rules are very simple. The support system is the smallest system, and there are only 16 classes.”
When the students of Class One and Class Sixteen heard their names, they stepped out and stood at the position pointed out by Cao Fenglin.
“Class 2 and Class 15!”
“Class 3 and Class 14!”
“Class 4 and Class 13!”
MO Xiu was from Class 6, so he was naturally assigned to Class 11. What was surprising was that all four of Class 11 were girls.
Just when everyone thought that Cao Fenglin would split everyone into groups for the team battle, Cao Fenglin didn’t disappoint Moxiu. His words were shocking, and the way he fought was terrifyingly casual.
“A total of four students from the support department will be selected for the solo competition, as well as two groups of five people.”
“Now, we will form a group of eight. Class One and Class Sixteen will have a one-on-one elimination match, and so on. You can decide who will compete with who. If you can’t decide, you can play rock-paper-scissors.”
“Four people will be eliminated, and the remaining four will become the new class one. Tomorrow, the new class one and the new class eight will have a one-on-one elimination match. The rules will be the same. You will choose your opponent. The day after tomorrow, the new class one will have a duel with the new class four, and the day after tomorrow, the new class one will have a duel with the new class two.”
Everyone was dumbfounded. This…. It was simply perfunctory!

                    



Chapter 60: I Want to Challenge You

“Didn’t you hear what I said? Do you understand?”
Cao Fenglin finally raised his voice, causing everyone to regain their senses.
“Understood ! ”
“Alright, if you understand, then stop wasting time. Let’s start the competition, starting from the first group!”
The first group consisted of Class 1 and Class 16. The eight of them came to the center of the field and were a little confused. They had to choose who to fight with. How could they choose?
It had been half a month since the start of the semester, and everyone knew who was stronger. At this time, no one wanted to face the strongest, so they were stuck in a stalemate.
Cao Fenglin’s patience was limited. After waiting for ten minutes, there was still no response from the eight of them. He raised his megaphone and said,””Divide into groups according to where you are standing now. Two people face each other and form a group. The first group will start with the stupid kid!”
The two classes stood face to face. According to Cao Fenglin, they were indeed divided into groups.
The first group began the competition. Both of them had amplification skills, and their strength was relatively similar. They fought for a long time without determining the winner.
In the end, it was only when one of the students ‘skills went on cooldown that the other took the opportunity to attack fiercely that the outcome was decided. The match had lasted for nearly twenty minutes. Cao Fenglin was clearly getting impatient.
After the competition ended, he said,” Everyone, move out of the way. The remaining three pairs will compete together. The next competition will be the same. The four groups of the two classes will compete at the same time.”
The morning passed very quickly. Whether it was the competition or watching the competition, it was not boring.
The four groups were competing at the same time, and the competition process was much faster. In the morning, there were already eight classes participating in the competition. Moxiu’s class six should be able to compete in the afternoon.
In the afternoon, MO Xiu and the others went to the cafeteria for lunch.
“What’s the name of the club you’ve established, MO Xiu?” Mu Mu asked curiously. How’s the development going? How many people were there? I was recruited by the Vermilion Bird Society, or else I would definitely have joined.”
It was obvious that Mu Mu felt guilty. She was the only one who didn’t join MO Xiu’s club.
Without waiting for MO Xiu to speak, Dong Fang said, “Hehe, our Strongest
Club was founded with five people, and we still have five people now!”
“The strongest club?” Mu Mu asked doubtfully. Are you that confident? But I’m asking for your name!”
Dong Fang and He Lingyue looked at MO Xiu together, wanting him to explain.
MO Xiu spread his hands and said,” The club’s name is the Strongest Club. The number is 666. You can check it out!”
Mu Mu was a little stunned. MO Xiu was a very low-key person. His strength could be said to be one of the best in the Support class. He was very famous in the class. However, he had never seen MO Xiu show off before. Why would he come up with such a name to attract hatred?
“Ah, the strongest club?” Mu Mu said awkwardly. It’s quite nice.”
He Lingyue could see that Mu Mu was trying to hide her embarrassment, so she braced herself and praised him.
” Mu Mu Mu, it’s okay, I want to laugh, I want to laugh, I don’t have a way, anyway, I already have this name, ‘”‘
Mu Mu had always been straightforward. When he heard He Lingyue’s words and looked at MO Xiu and Dong Fang’s half-smiling faces, he laughed heartily.
“Hahaha, Moxiu, why did you come up with such a name?” “My strength doesn’t allow me to keep a low profile anymore. ”
The few of them spent their lunch break chatting and laughing.
He returned to the No. 1 private room of the No. 3 martial arts field and prepared for the afternoon competition.
In front of MO Xiu’s class 6 was the battle between class 5 and class 12.
The strength of Class Five was extremely strong. Three students won with an overwhelming advantage, and the other student met the strongest person of Class Twelve and lost after half an hour of fierce battle.
“The next group, Class 6 and Class 11, quickly enter the arena to choose your opponents!”
Cao Fenglin sat on the chair and placed a hand on his cheek as he spoke impatiently.
Eight people entered. Class 11 was full of girls, while Class 6 had MO Xiu and Dong Fang, two boys.
Moxiu himself was 1.8 meters tall, and he stood out among the eight of them.
There was no need to talk about Dong Fang. He could crush MO Xiu, let alone a girl.
It gave people the feeling that Class 6 was bullying them.
Seeing that no one spoke, MO Xiu was afraid that Cao Fenglin would make the decision to arrange another battle. He suggested,””How about this? The two girls in our class will choose their opponents, and the remaining two in your class will choose the two boys. How about that?”
This plan seemed unfair, but since no one in class 11 was particularly strong,
Mu Mu and He Linzvue didn’t choose the weak one. It was basicallv a matter of luck for Dong Fang and MO Xiu to defeat the strong one.
The four students of Class 6 naturally supported Moxiu’s suggestion. The four girls of Class 11 whispered to each other for a while before nodding in agreement.
Mu Mu was straightforward and straightforward, and He Lingyue wasn’t one to drag her feet either. The two of them quickly chose their opponents.
The remaining two people were not disappointed that they were going to fight a boy. Instead, one of them was filled with excitement.
Moxiu took a closer look. This girl was very petite and should be around 160 centimeters tall. Her figure was well-proportioned, and it was obvious that she trained frequently.
It was the remaining two girls of Class Il’s turn to choose their opponents. After the two of them looked at each other, the petite girl pointed at MO Xiu and said,”Mo Xiu! I know you’re strong, I want to challenge you!”
Everyone was shocked when they heard this. Although MO Xiu kept a low profile, his identity as the top scorer of the college entrance examination could not be hidden.
Everyone knew that there was a boy called MO Xiu. He had an offensive skill, but he had registered as a support type. Everyone avoided him as much as possible. They did not expect this unknown little girl to dare challenge MO Xiu.
After all, Yanjing University’s competition system was very complete. The results obtained at the end of each academic year would be recorded in the file. When they graduated, major companies and departments would consider whether to hire them based on their results.
The treatment given to those who had just advanced to the top ten of the selection was completely different. No one wanted to waste this opportunity and try their best to get a higher ranking.
And this girl had taken the risk and chosen MO Xiu.
Moxiu narrowed his eyes. He couldn’t figure out why this girl had chosen him. Could it be that she had a good relationship with the girl beside her and didn’t want her friend to face a strong enemy? It didn’t look like it.
Cao Fenglin laughed playfully and picked up the loudspeaker.””Alright, the groups are divided. The competition begins!”
The four groups came to their respective fields. The field was 50 meters square. The rules of victory and defeat were either out of the circle or losing combat power.
Moxiu had long known about this rule. It was a commonly used rule in all major competitions in society.
After entering the arena, the other three groups quickly entered the competition. MO Xiu didn’t move because he could tell that the other party had something to say.
“My name is Yang Qingzhuo, remember my name.”
“I’ll remember that. I’m very curious as to why you chose to challenge me.” “You’ll know in a while. We’ll talk about it halfway through the game!” “Interesting. Then let’s begin…” Moxiu smiled.
MO Xiu was stunned halfway through his sentence. He had activated God’s Snooping while he was speaking and was stunned by Yang Qingzhuo’s skill.
” Skill 1: Godly Speed 3
[Skill effect: Increases speed by 800% on any target. When used on two targets at the same time, increases speed by 400%. When used on three targets at the same time, increases speed by 267%. When used on four targets at the same time, increases speed by 200%. At the same time…]
When using a skill, the number of targets can be adjusted at will.
[Duration: 10 minutes]
[Cooldown time: 12 hours]
This was the first time Motheo had seen a Level 3 skill.
Without a doubt, Yang Qingzhuo was a support, a top-grade support. His speed alone had reached an astonishing 800%!
Mnxill’q gaze gradually turned geri0ur He knew that he had encountered  powerful enemy!

                    



Chapter 61: Competition to Pick Up Girls

“Shall we begin?” Yang Qingzhuo asked.
Moxiu made an inviting gesture and said, “Let’s begin!”
As soon as the two words were spoken, the two of them activated their skills at the same time. It was obvious that neither of them had underestimated the other.
MO Xiu was the first to attack. He was extremely fast and appeared in front of Yang Qingzhuo in an instant.
Yang Qingzhuo’s punch missed and he disappeared.
MO Xiu instantly turned around and blocked Yang Qingzhuo’s sneak attack.
Yang Qingzhuo didn’t disappear just now, but he was so fast that MO Xiu couldn’t see all of his movements clearly.
This was the first time MO Xiu had felt a sense of danger when facing someone his age. This speed was very troublesome. If Yang Qingzhuo could break through his defense, it would be a tough battle.
MO Xiu was glad that weapons were not allowed in Yanjing University’s competitions. If Yang Qingzhuo had a sharp dagger in his hand, he would be like a tiger with wings.
Yang Qingzhuo fought aggressively. He stayed by MO Xiu’s side and waited for an opportunity to strike. From time to time, he would give a few quick punches. He did not linger in the battle and would retreat after the fight.
Yang Qingzhuo was not only fast, but also agile. She was very agile.
Even though MO Xiu’s reaction speed was extremely fast, he was unable to hit Yang Qingzhuo. With his small body and nimble steps, he dodged cleverly.
MO Xiu had intentionally revealed his flaws many times to lure Yang Qingzhuo, but Yang Qingzhuo was very smart and never fell for it.
Fortunately, Yang Qingzhuo had a fatal weakness, which was that his attack power was not enough to break through Moxiu’s strong defense.
If they continued fighting like this, they could only wait until the cooldown of their skills ended before deciding the outcome.
Moxiu knew that Yang Qingzhuo’s skill had a duration of ten minutes. If both of them used their skills at the same time, it would enter the cooldown period at the same time.
Without any skills, Moxiu was confident that he could take down Yang Qingzhuo.
The two continued to fight. MO Xiu attacked, but Yang Qingzhuo dodged. Yang Qingzhuo attacked, but MO Xiu blocked them all.
Moxiu didn’t have the advantage in speed, but his reaction speed was very fast. He could block every attack.
Although MO Xiu predicted that Yang Qingzhuo would not be able to break through his defenses, he still blocked all of his attacks out of caution.
At this moment, the other three groups had already decided the victor. The three people from Class 6 had undoubtedly won and advanced. Everyone was sighing at the strength of Class 6, and very few people paid attention to Moxiu.
When the other three matches ended, all eyes were on MO Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo.
At this time, everyone was shocked. The competition that they thought was the least suspense had actually reached the end.
When they took a closer look at the scene, everyone was stunned.
Of course, Dong Fang and the others were also paying attention to the competition.
“Where’s that girl?” Dong Fang asked He Lingyue. Why was there only MO Xiu on the field?”
Mu Mu also looked curiously at the stage. Because Yang Qingzhuo was too fast, most people could only see MO Xiu moving at a very fast speed. There was only a black shadow beside MO Xiu.
He Lingyue sighed.” It’s too fast. This person is too fast. Look at that black shadow. It’s that girl.”‘
When He Lingyue said this, everyone was shocked. What? There was actually someone who could be this fast?
“Hehe, MO Xiu is so powerful,” Dong Fang said foolishly.”
“Dong Fang, are you alright?” Mu Mu asked in surprise.”Looking at MO Xiu’s current state, he should be on par with that girl.”
” That’s right,” He Lingyue interjected.” It’s because of this that MO Xiu is so powerful. MO Xiu’s speed is far inferior to that girl’s, but look at MO Xiu’s movements. He seems to have blocked all the attacks.”‘
Hearing He Lingyue’s words, Mu Mu looked at MO Xiu thoughtfully.
The more he looked at Moxiu, the weirder his actions became. His body was almost motionless, but at a certain moment, he suddenly made a strange movement. It seemed like he was really blocking the attack, but how was this possible? How could he block the attack of an afterimage?
MO Xiu gradually became familiar with Yang Qingzhuo’s rhythm. His counterattacks gradually increased, and he almost hit Yang Qingzhuo several times.
Moxiu’s expression changed from seriousness to excitement. This was a good opportunity to train. It was not easy to encounter an opponent who was much faster than him.
MO Xiu threw another punch. This time, it hit Yang Qingzhuo, but was blocked by him.
After calculating the time, MO Xiu realized that there were still two to three minutes before the cooldown. He couldn’t help but feel that it was a pity. If it had been a little longer, he should have been able to capture Yang Qingzhuo.
At this moment, Yang Qingzhuo suddenly stopped running and stood where he was. The others saw the shadow disappear and Yang Qingzhuo appeared.
Yang Qingzhuo’s expression changed. He was no longer as confident as before. Instead, his brows were furrowed with a hint of joy.
MO Xiu was dumbfounded. Why was this person so strange? He was about to lose, but he was happy instead.
MO Xiu didn’t take the opportunity to attack. He just stood there and wanted to see what Yang Qingzhuo wanted to do.
Yang Qingzhuo’s brows relaxed and a bright smile appeared on his face.
“I really didn’t choose wrongly!”
MO Xiu raised his eyebrows, not understanding what Yang Qingzhuo meant.
Yang Qingzhuo walked up to MO Xiu step by step. The distance between them was less than a meter.
“Come and feel my skill, then we’ll continue talking!’”‘
MO Xiu was still thinking about the meaning behind Yang Qingzhuo’s words when suddenly, a green light flashed under his feet. MO Xiu felt his entire body become lighter.
Yang Qingzhuo’s skill could increase the number of targets he could hit at any time. In other words, when Yang Qingzhuo used his skill on Moxiu, his speed would increase by 400% when he hit two targets.
MO Xiu was still feeling the condition of his body when Yang Qingzhuo threw a punch at him.
Moxiu dodged lightly and actually managed to dodge five to six meters away. Wasn’t this amplification a little too obvious?
Looking at Yang Qingzhuo’s figure, MO Xiu finally understood why Yang Qingzhuo wanted to challenge him and why he was so confident.
This was because Yang Qingzhuo’s goal was not to defeat MO Xiu, but to join him.
MO Xiu stood still as Yang Qingzhuo approached! Punch! It was aimed at Moxiu’s abdomen, but it stopped the moment it was about to hit him.
“Why didn’t you dodge?” Yang Qingzhuo asked.”
“Because you won’t let me lose. you don’t want me to lose. you want me to Keep winning.”
Yang Qingzhuo smiled again. With his small figure and delicate face, he looked quite cute when he smiled.
“It seems that you are not only talented in combat. I made the right choice!’”‘ MO Xiu looked at Yang Qingzhuo and said,”l’m glad you chose me.””
Yang Qingzhuo raised his right pinky and said,”Then it’s settled!”
MO Xiu laughed out loud. This woman was quite childish. She actually wanted to pull the pinky.
No matter what he was thinking, MO Xiu still hooked his pinky to Yang Qingzhuo.
Cao Fenglin was a little disappointed when he saw this scene. He raised his megaphone and shouted,””Are the two of you dating here? Why? Is it a draw?” The scene on the field was very strange.
MO Xiu smiled and pointed at Yang Qingzhuo.” No, Teacher. She admitted defeat. I won. ‘”‘
Everyone was shocked. He said that his opponent admitted defeat?
“Not bad!” Yang Qingzhuo said with a grin. I admit defeat!”
What the hell? What kind of competition was this?
Dong Fang looked at MO Xiu with admiration.
He whispered,” Awesome! You won the competition and even got yourself a cute girl.. You’re competing to pick up girls!” It’s a brand new method!”

                    



Chapter 62: MO Xiu Is Awesome

Amidst the shock of the entire audience, the match between class six and class eleven ended.
In the end, all four people from class six advanced. The four people from the original class six, MO Xiu, Dong Fang, Mu Mu, and He Lingyue, formed the new class six.
The students below the stage were in a commotion because the match between MO Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo was too strange. It started inexplicably, and the shocking process ended in a blur.
MO Xiu left the stage and returned to Dong Fang and the others.
Dong Fang hugged MO Xiu and said,” Boss MO, you’re too awesome. You can even pick up girls in a competition. How did you do it?” Why didn’t I realize that you were so powerful in the past? You know why I applied for the support system. Hurry up and teach me a few moves. In the future, you will be my boss.
No! Idol!”
” What do you know?” MO Xiu snapped.” That girl named Yang Qingzhuo has foresight.’”‘
At this moment, He Lingyue and Mumu also walked over. They were curious about Yang Qingzhuo’s foresight. Now, everyone was confused.
“It’s not convenient to talk about it here. Let’s watch the competition first. We’ll talk about it after the competition is over.””
After that, there was a competition between Class 7 and Class 10, as well as between Class 8 and Class 9. One of the girls caught MO Xiu’s attention.
Mu Mu came over and said,” MO Xiu, this girl is called Xiao Lan. Her skill is the blue flame on her body. She and you are both favorites to win the championship for the suDDort svstem. She is also the sister of the third-vear
senior Xiao Hong. ‘”‘
MO Xiu wasn’t interested at first. He only felt that Xiao Lan was stronger. When he heard Xiao Hong’s name, he felt a headache coming on. That unreasonable woman.
In the evening, the day’s competition ended. Cao Fenglin yawned as he walked to the center of the arena.
“Those who have advanced will come here tomorrow. Those who have been eliminated don’t have to come. After the selection is over, everyone will gather here.”
The students, regardless of whether they had advanced or not, walked out of the door sighing. How could they meet such a teacher?
After MO Xiu walked out, he wanted to go back to the dormitory first, but he was stopped by He Lingyue and Mu Mu.
“MO Xiu, what’s going on between you and Yang Qingzhuo?” Mu Mu asked. I’m so anxious.”
He Lingyue also looked at MO Xiu expectantly. MO Xiu had no choice but to bring them to the cafeteria and chat while eating.
Mu Mu was an impatient person. Once he sat down, he said impatiently,””Moxiu, can you speak now?”
MO Xiu kept them in suspense, “Yang Qingzhuo knew that he couldn’t beat me, but he still challenged me. Can’t you guess why?””
The three of them shook their heads. Mu Mu said unhappily,””Aiya, Moxiu, hurry up and tell me. Why?”
“Because she wants to join me!”
Mu Mu rolled her eyes and said, “Join the strongest club?””
“No,” MO Xiu shook his head and said,”Do you still remember the rules of the competition that Teacher Cao said?”
Hearing this, He Lingyue’s eyes lit up. Apparently, she understood.
Mu Mu whispered,” Four people will be selected to advance in the one-on-one elimination round. Then, the top two in the competition will choose their own team to advance in the team competition…” Ah! I understand. She wants you to take her to the team competition after you win.”
” That’s right,” Moxiu said.” That’s what she’s thinking. She chose me to fight today to show me her strength.’”‘
“You agreed in the end, so she admitted defeat?” He Lingyue said.”
MO Xiu nodded in response. He Lingyue and Mu Mu were both deep in thought. Only Dong Fang was unhappy.
“So you’re not chasing after girls? Sigh, you were excited for nothing.’”‘
MO Xiu didn’t pay attention to this guy who didn’t do his job properly and just smiled.
“Why did Yang Qingzhuo do this?” He Lingyue asked with a deeper meaning. With her strength, it was possible for her to enter the top four, right? At that time, wouldn’t he be able to advance in both the solo and team competitions?”
“I’ve thought about this too. Maybe she thinks that the one-on-one competition isn’t very meaningful.’”‘
“That’s right, a IVI match is meaningless to a Support.”
The person who spoke was Yang Qingzhuo. She had appeared behind them.
This made them feel a little awkward. After all, they were discussing others behind their backs and were discovered.
Yang Qingzhuo sat down beside MO Xiu.
“I think that duels are meaningless for a team. A good assistant only needs to do two things. The first is to help the team win, and the second is to have the ability to protect themselves as much as possible and not become a burden to the team. ”
Mu Mu didn’t agree,” What if you face an enemy alone?!”‘
Yang Qingzhuo leaned towards MO Xiu and said, “A good Support should become the shadow of the main attacker, inseparable!”
The few of them had strange looks in their eyes. Yang Qingzhuo’s words and
actions were very ambiguous, and it was inevitable that they would misunderstand.
Dong Fang’s eyes lit up. He thought to himself, ‘Isn’t MO Xiu still chasing after girls?’
“Then, having an extra promotion spot in the one-on-one competition will also be helpful to you,” He Lingyue asked.”
Yang Qingzhuo then sent a message to MO Xiu,”That slot is dispensable. If I didn’t choose to fight against Moxiu today, I might have advanced. However, I lost the opportunity to form a team with Moxiu.”
Yang Qingzhuo looked at MO Xiu affectionately and said, “This is my support path!”
MO Xiu was startled by Yang Qingzhuo’s glance and quickly averted his gaze.
“What is your support path?” Mu Mu asked curiously.” “The team is the main thing, and…” Yang Qingzhuo said proudly.
Yang Qingzhuo lowered his head shyly.
“Also, in a sense, Moxiu is my master!!!”
It was unknown if it was due to nervousness or some other reason, but when he said the last sentence, MO Xiu was his master, his voice became much louder. The surrounding students looked over.
Some of the students from the auxiliary support system had an expression of understanding when they saw this scene.
MO Xiu held his head and lowered his head. He had thought that Yang Qingzhuo was a very far-sighted girl who understood that the future of a Support was a team.
He didn’t expect her to do such a thing. This was going to blow up. Looking at the degree of discussion among the surrounding students, this matter would spread quickly.
The more Dong Fang listened, the more excited he became. In the end, he couldn’t control his excitement. He slammed the table and spilled the food on the table. He stood up and shouted.
“MO Xiu! Awesome!”
Dong Fang thought that this was an exciting moment, but MO Xiu was so embarrassed that he didn’t dare to raise his head. What was going on?
Not only did the surrounding people look at Yang Qingzhuo strangely, but they also looked at He Lingyue and Mu Mu, who were sitting with MO Xiu.
Yang Qingzhuo finally realized that something was wrong. He looked around and ran away, his face red.
The atmosphere was extremely awkward. Mu Mu felt that his worldview had been impacted and was stunned.
“MO Xiu, why don’t we leave first?” He Lingyue asked MO Xiu.”
MO Xiu already had this intention, so he brought the few of them and fled.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang went straight to the dormitory. As they walked, they said to Dong Fang, “What are you doing in the cafeteria? Tomorrow, we will spar in the private room of the fifth training field.”
Dong Fang had heard about Liu Ziyang and MO Xiu sparring previously. He was so frightened that he shook his head and did not dare to speak.
MO Xiu sighed. Why were there so many stupid teammates around him?
When he returned to his dorm, Moxiu turned on his phone and saw a photo that was going viral on the internet.
MO Xiu sat with his hand on his forehead. Yang Qingzhuo sat beside him with his hand covering his face. Dong Fang stood there with an excited expression.
There were four big words on the picture.
“MO Xiu! Awesome!”

                    



Chapter 63: Scumbag (1)

Looking at the pictures that had gone viral, MO Xiu had the urge to beat Dong Fang up right now.
Forget it. MO Xiu couldn’t be bothered to look at it anymore. He might as well turn off his phone and go to sleep.
The next morning, MO Xiu walked out of the dormitory and experienced the feeling of being a celebrity. Everywhere he went, people would look at him.
Downstairs, Yang Qingzhuo was waiting for him.
“What are you doing here?” asked MO Xiu. ”
“I was waiting for you!”
“Why are you waiting for me?” Moxiu asked curiously. Didn’t you say that you don’t have to go to the selection competition today?”
Yang Qingzhuo said playfully,” Yes, yes. The teacher said that you don’t have to go, but he didn’t say that you can’t go. I’ll accompany you to the competition. Did you forget what I said yesterday?” I am your shadow.”
Dong Fang didn’t dare to say anything after yesterday’s incident. He quietly followed behind MO Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo.
The passers-by looked at him strangely, and MO Xiu felt a little uncomfortable.
“Go back and wait. You don’t have to follow me. After the results of the competition are out, I’ll choose you.”
“I know you’ll choose me, so I’ll follow you too. This will help us develop our relationship.”
MO Xiu really couldn’t get through to this girl, so he could only give up trying to persuade her and let her follow him.
After arriving at the stadium, MO Xiu was shocked. There were even more people here than yesterday. Didn’t Cao Fengqing say that the eliminated people didn’t need to come? How could there be so many?
In the next second, Moxiu understood that these people were here for him.
A group of men shouted,” MO Xiu! Awesome!” He walked towards MO Xiu.
“Moxiu, quickly tell me, how did you make this little Ioli beside you acknowledge you as her master? Just teach me one move.”
“Go to the side, you don’t have any sincerity at all. How would MO God teach you? MO God, I’ll pay a hundred thousand for the registration fee, how about
MO Xiu thought to himself that this was not good. He might not be able to keep a low profile anymore.
At this moment, Cao Fenglin’s voice rang out. This was the first time MO Xiu felt that Cao Fenglin was so cute.
“What do you do? This is the selection venue for the Support Element. All unrelated people, get out!”
When everyone saw that their teacher had arrived, those who were not of the support system all retreated.
Cao Fenglin closed the door and said, “Mo Xiu, you’re very popular. You even have fans.
MO Xiu didn’t expect Cao Fenglin to make a joke out of him in front of everyone. He could only smile awkwardly.
Right now, everyone’s attitude towards MO Xiu was divided into two extremes. The boys looked at MO Xiu with envy, while the girls looked at him with disgust.
Moxiu spent the entire morning under these two gazes.
In the afternoon, it was finally Moxiu’s new class six’s turn to compete. “New Class 3 and Class 6 will enter the arena to choose their opponents.”
There were three girls and one boy in the new class. Although the three girls looked at MO Xiu with killing intent, they knew the severity of the situation and did not want to face MO Xiu.
In the end, the people from the new Class 3 took the initiative to suggest that they use the plan that Moxiu had proposed last time.
In the end, after they were split into groups, MO Xiu was matched up against a short-haired girl with a gender-looking face.
The girl snorted and said,” MO Xiu, don’t think that I’m easy to deal with. Even if I can’t beat you, I’ll make you suffer. Scumbag who plays with women. Ptui!””
The short-haired girl’s voice was not soft. Everyone present heard it. There were originally many girls in the support department. At this moment, they remembered that there was an earth-shattering shout.
“MO Xiu, scumbag!”
Cao Fenglin saw that this was going to affect the progress of the competition and quickly shouted for them to stop.
‘Quiet down, don’t bring your personal grudges into the competition. Since we’ve finished dividing the teams, let’s start the competition.”
All of them entered the arena. It was unknown whether it was because of their strength or because of their notorious reputation, but almost all of the students had come to watch MO Xiu’s match.
Although Moxiu was annoyed, he wasn’t too affected. He used God’s Snooping on the short-haired girl as usual.
” Skill 1: Weaken
[Skill Effect: Weakens a single target, reducing speed, strength, and concentration by 30%.]
[Duration: 3 minutes]
[Cooldown time: 3 hours]
Debuff skill? This was the first time Moxiu had encountered such a skill. This skill was very difficult to deal with, and there was no chance of him using trickery.
This was because regardless of whether Motheo used the skill first or if the opponent weakened him first, the reduction was the same.
Since that was the case, Moxiu might as well use the War God’s Descent to feel the sudden weakening.
Seeing that the other party did not move, MO Xiu took the initiative to attack.
When the girls below the stage saw Moxiu’s actions, someone immediately said,””As expected of a scumbag. He still has such a huge advantage against a girl, but he actually attacked first. Scumbag!”
“Yes! Scumbag!”
“Scumbag MO Xiu!”
Moxiu listened to the voices below the stage and did not stop moving. When he was about to reach the short-haired girl, his body was enveloped by a layer of red light and his body sank.
Moxiu stood on the spot and felt his body. Was this a negative state?
In order to feel how much of an impact the weakening would have on his body, Moxiu did not use fierce attacks to eliminate his opponent. Instead, he slowly exchanged blows with his opponent.
MO Xiu didn’t feel anything, but when the girls saw this scene, they exploded. “This pervert, is he trying to take advantage of me by playing around like this?” “Look at that wretched look. That’s it. It’s too much. He won’t let go of a girl.” The boys ‘eyes lit up. This was a good way to take advantage of her.
They all shouted the same slogan in unison.
“MO Xiu! Awesome!”
It was a mess below the stage. Cao Fenglin sighed and muttered to himself,””Sigh, it’s so good to be young. The faculty selection competition is almost like MO Xiu’s solo concert.”
Moxiu was also annoyed by this. Now, he felt that it was about time. The effect of this weakening on him was fading as time passed. At first, he was not used to it, and some flaws appeared. However, it slowly recovered.
In other words, a skill like Weakening would pose the greatest threat the moment it was activated. It would disrupt the rhythm of the attack.
Moxiu suddenly exerted strength and pushed the short-haired girl’s arm, pushing her out of bounds.
With MO Xiu’s victory, all four matches were decided. The four people from the new class six advanced once again and became the new class three.
Accompanied by the two different voices of ” scumbag ” and ” awesome,” MO Xiu left the stage. The final match between the new class 4 and class 5 was about to begin. MO Xiu finally stopped for a while.
Taking advantage of the last match, MO Xiu left after informing Cao Fenglin. He didn’t want to get into trouble again.
Moxiu was in a good mood as he walked out of the stadium. It was finally quiet.
As she walked forward, she felt someone pulling her from behind. She turned around and saw that there was no one there. When she looked down, she saw Yang Qingzhuo tugging at the corner of her clothes.
“Hey, why did you follow me?” MO Xiu sighed.” Yang Qingzhuo said, “Did I cause you trouble, Morixiu?” I’ll help you explain.”
“It’s okay. You don’t have to explain for me.”
What a joke. MO Xiu was scared of being scammed. If Yang Qingzhuo couldn’t explain it clearly, he would only make things worse. People would naturally forget about this kind of news after a long time. Let him be.
At this moment, MO Xiu’s phone rang. He picked it up and saw that it was Liu Ziyang. This guy had been under a lot of pressure from the competition recently. Why did he have the time to call?
“Hello? What was it? Don’t tell me you want to shout that MO Xiu is awesome?” Liu Ziyang didn’t dare to say anything else after the last ‘sparring’ incident.
“No, Boss, Zheng Yi wants to get together. I called you yesterday but you turned off your phone, so he came to find me.”
MO Xiu glanced at the follower beside him.
“Hmm…. Fine!”

                    



Chapter 64: The God of Food, Yang Qjngzhuo

MO Huan thought about it. He couldn’t shake off this stalker anyway. It would be troublesome if he was seen wandering around the school. He might as well bring her out.
MO Xiu walked in front while Yang Qingzhuo followed behind him. The girls who passed by cast disdainful looks at him.
“You’ve got the little girl, why don’t you wait for her! Humph!”
When the two of them arrived at the gate, Liu Ziyang was already waiting for them. They got into Qiang Zi’s car and went to Zheng Yi’s school.
Zheng Yi’s school was called Qingyun University, which was second only to Yanjing University.
The reason why they came to find Zheng Yi instead of Zheng Yi going to Yanjing University was because there was a very famous food street near the school.
MO Xiu and the others stopped at the school gate and got out of the car. Qiang Zi had something to do and left first.
Just as she got out of the car, she heard Zheng Yi’s hearty laughter.
“Hahaha, MO Xiu, Liu Ziyang, I missed you so much.”
Zheng Yi came over and hugged MO Xiu first, then Liu Ziyang. After hugging the two of them, he realized that there was a girl beside MO Xiu.
Zheng Yi said sarcastically, “Mo Xiu, who is this?” Why don’t you introduce them?”
“Oh, she’s my teammate, Yang Qingzhuo.”
“Just teammates?”
“Zheng Yi, this is the girl in the photo.” Liu Ziyang couldn’t help but interrupt.”
Zheng Yi had also seen the photo yesterday, and it was only then that he came to a realization.
“I understand, I understand everything!”
MO Xiu couldn’t be bothered to explain, so he changed the topic.””Cut the crap. We’re at your home ground. Lead the way and entertain us!”
Zheng Yi chuckled.” No problem. Leave it to me. Come with me. I know a good hotpot restaurant. Let’s go together.””
Zheng Yi seemed to be very familiar with this area. He led the few of them to a hotpot restaurant.
Zheng Yi reported his name and the waiter arranged a private room for them.
Everyone sat down. Zheng Yi handed the menu to MO Xiu and said,””Come, MO Xiu, order a few dishes.”
Moxiu flipped through the menu. It was written that Moxiu had never eaten mutton and beef before.
Due to the mutation, most animals had innate skills. After the war, they signed a contract of exemption, and all animals were evacuated from human territory. Now, all meat was artificially raised and the price was very expensive.
In the past, Moxiu couldn’t afford to eat at all. The best meat he had eaten was the pheasant that his mother had personally cooked.
MO Xiu didn’t know how to order and didn’t want to pretend. He directly handed the menu to Fatty Liu Ziyang.
Liu Ziyang pushed the menu to Zheng Yi.
“You guys order. I’m not picky when it comes to food.”
Zheng Yi took the menu and was about to order it himself when he suddenly saw Yang Qingzhuo sitting beside MO Xiu.
“Sister, order a few dishes. Pick what you like to eat. It’s my treat. If I can’t afford it, there’s still the God of Fortune, Liu Ziyang.”
Yang Qingzhuo took the menu and looked up at MO Xiu. Seeing MO Xiu nod, it was as if a switch had been turned on. She, who had been silent all this while. rolled up her sleeves and flipped open the menu.
“Give me five servings of premium lamb!”
‘Yes. Is this veal your signature dish? Give me five portions!”
“This colorful meat platter looks good too. Five servings!”
Zheng Yi widened his eyes and looked at Yang Qingzhuo, then at MO Xiu. What was going on? This little girl can eat so much?
MO Xiu noticed that something was wrong and whispered into Yang Qingzhuo’s ear,”l ordered so much. Can I finish it all?”
“MO Xiu, can’t you order it?” Yang Qingzhuo asked.”
The waiter looked at MO Xiu with a strange gaze. He had such a cute girlfriend, yet he didn’t let him eat his fill. How long had he been starving?
Moxiu had no choice. He pointed at a meat dish on the menu and said,”Give me five of these as well!”
The waiter’s expression immediately changed. It seemed that he was a good man who knew how to dote on his girlfriend.
Yang Qingzhuo smiled brightly and continued to order.
He ordered another ten plates of meat and pondered for a long time. He looked at everyone as if he had made an important decision. He nodded heavily and handed the menu to the waiter.
“Alright, that’s all.”
“Do you want to order something?” asked MO Xiu. It’s all meat.”
“Isn’t eating hotpot about eating meat?” Yang Qingzhuo asked.”
MO Xiu and the other two were speechless. The meat was served very quickly. There were four people and thirty plates of meat. The entire table couldn’t fit them.
MO Xiu looked at Liu Ziyang, meaning that the meat was all up to him.
The waiter wanted to help but was rejected by Yang Qingzhuo.
After the waiter left, Yang Qingzhuo picked up two plates of meat and threw them into the hotpot.
As he threw the meat, he said,”They’re too slow. We’ll do it ourselves, hehe.””
The few people who were worried about ordering too much just now were relieved in less than five minutes.
Yang Qingzhuo scooped out the two plates of meat and distributed them to the four of them. Then, he skillfully threw two plates into the pot.
After that, she sat down and ate her portion of meat. She looked at the undercooked meat in the pot with anticipation.
When the meat was cooked, he scooped it all out and repeated the process.
Seeing that MO Xiu, Zheng Yi, and Liu Ziyang hadn’t finished eating the meat on their plates, they put all the meat on their own plates. There was too much meat to put on their plates, so they even specially asked the waiter for a small basin.
Within a few minutes, the two plates of meat were finished. He continued to scoop the meat.
Seeing MO Xiu and the other two staring at him blankly, Yang Qingzhuo said embarrassedly,”Why are you… If you don’t want to eat, you can eat as much as you want. I’ll give you… Meat!”
Yang Qingzhuo couldn’t even speak properly. Zheng Yi secretly gave MO Xiu a thumbs up when he saw this.
She could eat so much. Would MO Xiu be able to afford it in the future?
Half an hour later, Yang Qingzhuo finished twenty-two plates of meat by himself.
This was the first time Moxiu felt like he had seen a monster. How did such a
small girl eat so much meat? Could it be that his entire body was filled with his stomach?
Yang Qingzhuo held his belly and smiled with satisfaction.
After that, she sat in her seat and did not speak anymore. She became a quiet girl again.
This couldn’t even be called a foodie. It should be called a God of Food!
In the past half an hour, the three of them had spent most of their time watching Yang Qingzhuo’s performance and hadn’t eaten much.
After Yang Qingzhuo finished eating, the few of them began to eat and chat.
“Zheng Yi, you didn’t seek death at Qingyun University, did you?” MO Xiu asked. ”
“When have I ever done that?” Zheng Yi said unhappily. Your performance is great, but you’re quite famous. Even the slogan ‘MO Xiu is awesome’ has come to our school.”
Zheng Yi glanced at Yang Qingzhuo, who was beside him. He didn’t feel too good and didn’t continue.
“By the way, let me tell you something good. I have a girlfriend.”
Zheng Yi took out his phone and showed MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang a few photos.
The girl on it had an elegant temperament and was somewhat like a goddess.
MO Xiu understood Zheng Yi the best.” She’s your girlfriend. You brought her here to show off a long time ago. These photos look like they were secretly taken.
Zheng Yi was exposed and said awkwardly, “”Ahaha, to be precise, she’s my future girlfriend. I haven’t gotten her yet.”
Zheng Yi glared at MO Xiu, blaming him for destroying the stage. Liu Ziyang laughed as he listened, as if he suddenly remembered something.
“Right! MO Xiu, Zheng Yi, I heard from Hao Ren that there’s a powerful figure in the power attack department from Shun City No.l Middle School. Do you know him?”
“Who is it?” MO Xiu and Zheng Yi said in unison.
“Zhou Qiuwu!”

                    



Chapter 65: Zhou Qiuwu

Moxiu pondered for a moment. He had some impression of her, but he couldn’t remember who she was.
“MO Xiu, have you forgotten about the famous Zhou Qiuwu?” Zheng Yi asked.
He had awakened two skills, but he didn’t take the college entrance examination. He must have been recruited into Yanjing University.”
Only then did MO Xiu remember that Zhou Qiuwu was a famous person for a period of time. However, he slowly disappeared from everyone’s sight. He didn’t expect to show off again at Yanjing University.
MO Xiu and Zheng Yi hadn’t seen each other for more than half a month. They finished their meal while chatting.
After dinner, MO Xiu and the others didn’t stay for long and returned to Yanjing University. After all, they still had to participate in the Department Selection Competition the next day, so they shouldn’t stay out too late.
When they returned to the dormitory, Yang Qingzhuo was still with MO Xiu. “Little stalker, I’m going back to the dormitory. Are you still following me?’”‘
“My dormitory is also here!”
Yang Qingzhuo followed MO Xiu to the third floor.
“I’m here. Which floor are you on? Hurry up and go back!”
Yang Qingzhuo pointed upstairs and left reluctantly.
MO Xiu shook his head helplessly. What should he do? Yang Qingzhuo was still clinging onto him.
After returning to the dormitory, MO Xiu lay on the bed and prepared to sleep.
There was a message message from Mu Qingyi.
There was only one picture, the famous ‘MO Xiu is Awesome!’ ,Mo Xiu slapped his head. This matter had still reached Mu Qingyi, and he did not know who had leaked it.
MO Xiu replied.
“Are you jealous?”
Mu Qingyi’s reply was still the same picture. “MO Xiu is awesome!” “What do you mean? Are you jealous?” “MO Xiu is awesome!”
“Can you post something else?”
Mu Qingyi did not send any pictures this time and typed directly.
[MO Xiu is awesome!]
‘ Hahaha, this is actually a misunderstanding…”
MO Xiu explained for a while, but he did not know if Mu Qingyi had listened to him.
He was speechless for a night.
The next morning, Yang Qingzhuo was waiting at Moxiu’s door.
MO Xiu sighed. Since he couldn’t avoid it, he decided to leave it at that.
When they arrived at the venue for the selection competition, there were clearly fewer people today. There were only four teams left with a total of sixteen people.
Those who had advanced had already competed for two rounds, and those who wanted to understand their opponents were more or less done. Those who had not advanced came here to watch the competition, so they might as well take more time to train.
There were a total of four classes left. In the morning, MO Xiu’s class, New New Class 3, was assigned to them.
The way he chose his opponent was the same as before. This time, Moxiu’s opponent was finally a boy.
The boy was very polite. After entering the arena, he did not start the competition immediately. Instead, he introduced himself.
“I call Guo Fan very happy can you match, I may hit but you, but out of learning angle, I hope you can go all out to match, one may let me know gap, two may.” Five hundred words are omitted here.
MO Xiu was annoyed by what he heard and wanted to interrupt him, but Guo Fan spoke too quickly and couldn’t interrupt at all.
The other three matches had ended, but Guo Fan was still talking.
Cao Fenglin looked at his watch. It was almost time to eat. He had endured for five minutes and had yet to stop.
“Student Guo Fan, you are disqualified from the competition. MO Xiu wins!”
Guo Fan paused for a second and said to Cao Fenglin,””Teacher, I can fight. Do you think that I can’t beat MO Xiu? Even if I can’t win, I can still contribute a wonderful match to my classmates. Why do you want to cancel my competition rules? I..
Cao Fenglin pointed to a few of his classmates and said, “Drag him out!””
A few students dragged Guo Fan out, and Guo Fan still said,”Teacher, I can fight, I can still fight…”
MO Xiu found it funny. What kind of person was this? He didn’t expect that he would advance without even fighting today.
This time, Mu Mu from the new new class three was eliminated, and the remaining three were promoted to class two.
Mu Mu was a little unhappy. She, who had always been forthright, was a little unhappy.
Mu Mu’s skills were not verv strong. so it was exDected that he would not be
able to advance.
What was surprising was that Cao Fenglin, a man who didn’t want to care about anything, actually came over to comfort Mu Mu. Mu Mu was also coaxed by him until she laughed out loud.
MO Xiu looked at He Lingyue. He Lingyue had always been with Mu Mu, so she should know something.
However, He Lingyue spread her hands, indicating that she wasn’t sure. However, looking at Cao Fenglin’s expression, it was obvious that things weren’t as simple as they seemed.
Seeing the two of them chatting and laughing, MO Xiu and the others did not wait for Mu Mu and secretly left.
As they walked out of the venue, He Lingyue wanted to say something but hesitated.
“He Lingyue, is there anything you want to tell me?” MO Xiu asked.” He Lingyue looked at MO Xiu and then at Yang Qingzhuo.
“Moxiu, can you choose me when you team up? I can give you my skill.”
MO Xiu already knew that He Lingyue’s skill, Future, could be used on others, but he still pretended to be surprised.
Before MO Xiu could say anything, Yang Qingzhuo stood in front of MO Xiu and glared at He Lingyue.
He Lingyue burst out laughing and said,”” Haha, I’m not trying to steal your master. I just want to join his team.”
As he spoke, he looked at Moxiu and waited for his reply. “I know, I’ll choose you when the time comes.””
“Thank you,” He Lingyue said.”l’ll be leaving then. Bye!””
MO Xiu understood why He Lingyue brought this up at this time. There were only eight contestants left in the qualifiers, and the remaining opponents were all very strong. It would be difficult for He Lingyue to advance further.
Dong Fang had a goal to pursue recently and left in a hurry.
MO Xiu had no idea where he was going with Little Stalker when Hao Ren called him and asked him to go to the activity room of the Strongest Club.
Since she had nothing to do, she decided to go and see what Hao Ren had been doing recently.
Upon entering the activity room, MO Xiu saw a girl sitting next to Hao Ren.
Dressed in a tight-fitting leather jacket, he gave off a particularly capable and experienced feeling.
Hao Ren saw Yang Qingzhuo following behind MO Xiu and smiled secretly.
“What are you laughing at?” asked MO Xiu. Let’s get down to business. This is…” Hao Ren suddenly became formal and introduced them to Moxiu.
“This is Duya, an Elementalist. I went through a lot of data screening and found a suitable candidate.”
Moxiu felt a little strange. Looking at her attire, he thought that Du Ya was an Agility System. He did not expect her to be an Elemental System.
MO Xiu extended his hand and said,” Hello, my name is MO Xiu. From now on, you will be a member of our strongest club.””
Du Ya ignored MO Xiu’s outstretched right hand and coldly said,””You’re the scumbag MO Xiu, right? However, it doesn’t matter. The requirement for me to join your club is that I don’t participate in the selection and directly enter the club battle.”
“No problem. It’s a pleasure working with you.” Moxiu extended his hand again.”
Du Ya’s philosophy was the same as MO Xiu’s, so MO Xiu was naturally willing to accept it.
Du Ya still ignored MO Xiu. She stood up and said,”l’ve already finished writing the application to join the club. If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving.” MO Xiu retracted his right hand and looked at Hao Ren.
Hao Ren smiled and said,” She’s like that, but she’s very strong. I see you’ve
brought someone with you. Is she joining our club?””
MO Xiu turned around and saw that Yang Qingzhuo had just finished a call and was looking at him.
“Yang Qingzhuo, have you joined a club?”
“I just called to quit my previous club. Where is your application? Give me one….”

                    



Chapter 66: Top Four

In the third training field, the auxiliary system selection competition.
Today, Cao Fenglin had eliminated all the eliminated contestants, leaving only the two classes that had advanced and…Mu Mu.
According to Cao Fenglin, Mu Mu would be his assistant in the future.
This time, Cao Fenglin did not let the two classes choose their own opponents. Instead, he personally divided them into groups.
He didn’t know if it was just his imagination, but Cao Fenglin seemed different.
MO Xiu was paired up against a girl named Hu Xianming, while He Lingyue was paired up against the strongest opponent, Xiao Lan.
As soon as the groups were divided, He Lingyue looked at MO Xiu helplessly, meaning that she had no chance. It was all up to him.
There was no one else in the stadium. It was very quiet, and the four groups were still competing at the same time. MO Xiu used God’s Snooping on Hu Xianming.
‘ Skill: Holy Light 2
[Skill Effect: Can cast Holy Light on any target ten times in ten minutes. Holy
Light can heal and purify negative statuses.]
[Cooldown time: 6 hours]
Pure nanny? This kind of pure healer could actually advance to the top eight?
MO Xiu hadn’t noticed Hu Xianming before, so he didn’t know how she was going to compete.
“Can we start?” Hu Xianming asked.”
Moxiu gestured for the other party to attack first.
Hu Xianming didn’t hold back and directly attacked, punching MO Xiu in the chest.
MO Xiu was just about to block when Hu Xianming’s fist suddenly changed direction and struck towards MO Xiu’s face.
Moxiu immediately activated the Descent of the War God and quickly retreated.
This was ancient martial arts! It had been a long time since they last met!
Moxiu had studied ancient martial arts before, but his knowledge was limited. He only knew the basics, such as Ba Gua Zhang.
Later on, after Wang Lei’s guidance in the cosmic tuition class, he slowly discovered that the simplest moves were the most effective against enemies.
MO Xiu had never encountered an ancient martial art like Hu Xianming’s, which had so many moves.
His carelessness earlier had given Moxiu a warning to never underestimate his opponent.
The two of them exchanged blows again. This time, Moxiu took the initiative and attacked with all his might.
No matter how powerful Hu Xianming’s moves were, he was still forced back by the absolute suppression.
Hu Xianming’s moves were both offensive and defensive, without a single flaw.
MO Xiu could only force Hu Xianming to retreat and exhaust her.
As the game dragged on, even if Hu Xianming could block MO Xiu’s attacks, he would still be injured and his stamina would continue to decrease.
MO Xiu seized the opportunity and punched Hu Xianming’s shoulder!
Hu Xianming didn’t manage to dodge the punch, and just when MO Xiu thought victory was in his hands, Hu Xianming’s body emitted a white light. It was the Holy Light skill.
MO Xiu’s fist and the holy light appeared on Hu Xianming’s body at the same time, and they actually negated the damage!
Hu Xianming caught MO Xiu off guard and threw a punch at him. His fist exerted a second force in the air, forcing MO Xiu back a step.
MO Xiu had never been so excited before. This Hu Xianming was too powerful!
Using the skill to the extreme, using the effect of the Holy Light to offset the damage caused by the enemy’s attack, wonderful! His timing was also very accurate.
And the punch he had thrown at MO Xiu just now had clearly used a special method of exerting force. Otherwise, Hu Xianming’s strength wouldn’t have been able to repel MO Xiu.
“I see!” said MO Xiu. Are you willing to form a team with me to participate in the team battle?”
“I’m sorry, I promised Sister Xiao Lan that I would join her team. ‘”‘
MO Xiu was not disappointed. Instead, he smiled and said, ‘”‘1 want you for sure. It seems that I need to defeat Xiao Lan and become the champion to snatch you!”
MO Xiu said this out of admiration.
Fortunately, there was no audience around. Otherwise, there would be a tsunami of scumbags.
Hu Xianming didn’t expect MO Yucheng to say this. He snorted coldly. “Beat me first!”
Both fists were thrown at MO Xiu. MO Xiu dodged to the side, but Hu Xianming’s fists continued to attack.
MO Xiu wasn’t in a hurry. He was more and more curious about Hu Xianming’s relentless pursuit of this fist technique that could even be used twice. He actually began to learn it in a proper manner.
Hu Xianming found it funny when he saw MO Xiu learning his fist technique. She had been practicing this fist technique since she was young and had only just made some progress. How could it be learned so easily?
At first, Hu Xianming only thought MO Xiu was funny, but the more he fought, the more shocked he became. What was wrong with this person? After only a dozen moves, the fist technique had some form.
MO Xiu didn’t exert any strength, so Hu Xianming naturally didn’t feel much pressure.
However, Hu Xianming was frowning. This man named MO Xiu was actually able to use his fist technique with a hint of charm. He was simply a monster!
MO Xiu had a preliminary understanding of the principle of the Second Step Force Release, and he had also figured out a thing or two about the boxing routine. However, there were still some problems with the connection between the two moves.
Just as MO Xiu was enjoying the fight, Hu Xianming suddenly struck MO Xiu’s arms with both palms, and he was forced back by the rebound.
After that, he raised his right hand and said to Cao Fenglin,”” Teacher, I admit defeat, I don’t want to fight!’”‘
“How can you just give up like this?” asked Moxiu.”
Hu Xianming cursed MO Xiu for pretending to be ignorant. If they continued fighting, he would probably learn the entire set of fist techniques. Cao Fenglin announced, “Mo Xiu wins!!”‘
‘ Alright,” Moxiu said unwillingly.” This match is over. But you have to remember that you’re in my team!””
Hu Xianming looked at MO Xiu with a complicated expression. On the one hand, he wanted to fulfill his promise to Xiao Lan, but on the other hand, he felt that MO Xiu’s strength was indeed terrifying, and joining him wasn’t a bad idea.
She lowered her head and thought for a moment, but still did not say anything. She turned around and walked out of the stadium.
MO Xiu had thought that he would be the last to finish the competition, but he didn’t expect Dong Fang to be even slower.
The one who had already advanced was a girl named Xue Ling ‘er. She wasn’t very familiar with her before. There was also Xiao Lan. As expected, she eliminated He Lingyue and advanced.
At this moment, Dong Fang wasn’t done yet, not because he had fallen into a bitter battle, but because his opponent’s skill was also to strengthen his defense. Neither of them could break through the other’s defense.
Just like that, they were in a stalemate. Moxiu looked at the boy opposite him. He wasn’t tall or strong.
MO Xiu coughed lightly. When Dong Fang looked at him, he pushed He Lingyue who was beside him.
He Lingyue looked at MO Xiu in confusion and said, ‘”Why did you push me?” “You’re so small. Shouldn’t I push you?” Moxiu said.”
Although He Lingyue had a very steady personality, she couldn’t stand MO Xiu’s provocation. Just as she was about to flare out, she saw MO Xiu winking at her.
He Lingyue didn’t quite understand what MO Xiu meant, so she simply ignored him and turned to watch the game.
When he saw Dong Fang’s actions, he suddenly realized that he was helping Dong Fang cheat.
At this moment, Dong Fang relied on his weight advantage to push his opponent away, wanting to push his opponent out of the arena.
MO Xiu’s actions earlier were clearly to tell Dong Fang this method.
The other party wanted to run, but Dong Fang’s two hands grabbed onto the other party tightly and finally pushed the other party out of bounds.
Cao Fenglin’s voice rang out. “The last match is over. Dong Fang wins!”
Then, he looked at Mu Mu.
Mu Mu took a step forward and said,” The competition has ended. The four students who have advanced are MO Xiu, Xiao Lan, Xue Ling ‘er, and Dong Fang. Congratulations, you’re representing the Support Department in the individual competition!”
MO Xiu and the other three nodded at each other.
Mu Mu continued,” That’s all for today. The final selection will be held tomorrow morning.. One or two teams will be selected to advance to the team battle!”

                    



Chapter 67: Registration

MO Xiu walked out of the stadium. As expected, the little stalker had been waiting for him.
Hao Ren had just called. From today onwards, they could go to the Student Union to sign up for the club competition and the solo competition. The club president had to bring all the members of the team to sign up.
For clubs with less than 1,000 members, each grade could only send out one team, and 10 people could sign up for the IVI.
Clubs with more than 1,000 members could fight two teams per grade, and 20 people could register for the one-on-one competition.
Each team must have no more than eight people, including substitutes.
There are only seven strong clubs, and all of them are Grade 1 students, and all of them are Grade 1 teams, and all of them can participate in the one-on-one competition.
Moni thought for a while and asked Hao Ren to ask Duya when she was free. The others were more cooperative, but Duya was the only one who was difficult to deal with.
Hao Ren soon sent a message saying that he was free today!
MO Xiu hurriedly gathered all the club members to register at the student union.
There were seven members in the strongest club: MO Xiu, Liu Ziyang, Dong Fang, He Lingyue, Hao Ren, Yang Qingzhuo, and Du Ya.
When they arrived at the Student Union building, they did not see the crowd they had imagined. There were only a dozen or so teams.
“Hao Ren, what happened?” MO Xiu asked Hao Ren. There were so many clubs, and only this few people came to sign up?
Hao Ren was now focused on helping Moxiu with the club’s affairs. He was already a know-it- all, and now he was even more well-informed.
“Registration is actually set up for some small and medium-sized clubs. Some big clubs don’t even need to register. The student union will take the initiative to send the declaration form, and they can just fill it in.”
“There are quite a few small and medium-sized clubs, right?” MO Xiu asked again.”
“Yes, but at this time, all the clubs of a certain size are either in the midst of the selection or haven’t done so yet. Before the list of participants is confirmed, most of these clubs will register a few days before the registration deadline.” Liu Ziyang raised his eyebrows and said, “That means that these clubs are all…”
Hao Ren covered his face and said,” That’s right. Those who are signing up now are all clubs like ours. They are the weakest clubs.”
Hearing Hao Ren’s words, MO Xiu was unwilling.
“Hao Ren, as the vice president, how can you destroy your own morale? Have you forgotten the name of our club?”
“When did I become the vice president?” Hao Ren asked with confusion.”
I hereby appoint you as the vice president!”
“Alright then!”
Moxiu was angry when he saw how listless Hao Ren and the others were. He didn’t create the club to be the weakest club.
MO Xiu cleared his throat and said,”Cough cough cough!” How about this, I see that you guys don’t seem to have much confidence. I’ll set a goal, a goal for the team battle. After all, the solo battle is all up to you, so there’s no way to set a goal.’
Upon hearing this, everyone’s gaze focused on MO Xiu.
MO Xiu didn’t say anything. He extended a finger.
“Top 100?” Hao Ren asked.
MO Xiu shook his head.
Liu Ziyang said,” You’re underestimating Boss too much. He’s definitely in the top ten! ‘”‘
“We only have one goal in the team competition!” Moxiu shook his head. First grade champion!”
“Tsk! ”
The other six people were stunned for a second before they all let out a ‘tsk’ sound. Even the unsociable Du Ya’s reaction was surprisingly the same as everyone else’s.
The clubs that were ranked behind the strongest clubs all looked at MO Xiu as if he was an idiot. Was this person crazy?
Soon, they were queued up to register for the strongest club.
“The name of the club!”
“The strongest club!”
The staff member raised his head and looked at Moxiu for a while, as if he wanted to remember Moxiu.
“Eh? Are you MO Xiu? Are you the president of the strongest club?”
MO Xiu nodded.
The staff could not help but laugh. Club number!”
“Do you want to register for the individual competition or the team competition?
“Everyone, sign up!”
“Then let’s start with the individual competition.”
MO Xiu reported the names of the seven people to the staff. Yanjing University focused on competition education, so no one wanted to give up the opportunity to compete.
‘ Yes,” the staff member explained.” It’s the individual competition of the club. The qualifying round is on the 15th of August. Remember to participate on time!’”‘
After that, the staff gave everyone a competition permit and they signed a few disclaimer statements before they were considered successful.
The staff member continued,” Next is the registration for the team competition. What are the year groups and the number of participating teams for the strongest club?”
” We only have one team,” Moxiu said.” We’re participating in the first grade competition. There are seven people in the team!”
“Are you sure that seven people will be participating in the competition? The rules allowed five main players and three substitutes, a total of eight people to participate in the competition. Shouldn’t they call another person over?”
” There’s no need for that,” Moxiu said confidently.” Just seven people. We just registered for the IVI competition.’”‘
The six people behind him rolled their eyes. What did he mean by there was no need? You can’t find the eighth person, right?
Since all seven of them had filled in their information, the team competition registration process was much faster.
After filling in the information, the staff asked, “The registration for the Strongest Society Team Competition is successful. What is the name of the team?”
Teams needed names because some clubs would sign up for many teams and would use names to differentiate them.
MO Xiu turned around and looked at the few of them. These people were given to him for free. When the club was named, none of them came out to speak.
Don’t even think about it.
“The strongest team!”
The staff stared at MO Xiu with wide eyes. The team’s name would be called out by the host during the competition. Was he so shameless?
I-ne you scue:
” Moxiu,” Hao Ren said as he pulled on Moxiu,” do you want to reconsider?
We’re going to attract hatred.””
“Haven’t I attracted enough aggro yet?” Moxiu asked.”
MO Xiu was the president of the strongest club and a scumbag who played with women. It was equivalent to a group of people mocking him in the entire school.
The corner of Hao Ren’s mouth twitched, and he decided to go with Moxiu.
MO Xiu turned around and said to the staff,”l’m sure. It’s called the strongest team. My teammates haven’t seen the world yet.”
The staff member didn’t know how to answer MO Xiu and subconsciously blurted out the famous quote.
“MO Xiu! Awesome!”
After registering, everyone walked out together. Liu Ziyang sneaked to MO Xiu’s side and asked softly.
“Boss, this is not your personality. You used to be low-key, but why are you so arrogant now?”
“I can’t keep a low profile now. In that case, I might as well turn the world upside down and see how capable I am.”
Moxiu slowly came to understand that increasing his fame would bring pressure, and this pressure would force him to become stronger. Moxiu was a stubborn person and liked this kind of invisible pressure.
The next morning, in the venue of the department’s selection competition.
There were only four people left. If everything went as planned, the champion of the Support Division would be chosen tomorrow.
Cao Fenglin brought Mu Mu into the stadium. Mu Mu had become a secretary and was the one speaking most of the time.
” Teacher Cao has yet to announce the champion’s reward. Now, I’ll tell everyone that the champion of the Support Division will first choose his teammates to form a team.. Also, the reward for the Support Division is a Heart
Cleansing Wood… “

                    



Chapter 68: Finals (1)

A Heart Cleansing Wood, this reward was not small.
The Heart-clearing Wood had also reached the level of the Spiritual
Concealment. However, it was not for consumption, but for nurturing.
As the name suggested, the effect of the Heart-clearing Wood was to clear one’s mind. People who lived around it for a long time could make their minds clear and their spiritual power stronger. This was too important for support.
A Support had to take care of the overall situation on the field, and a strong mental strength was essential.
Mu Mu continued,” The next group is MO Xiu versus Dong Fang, Xiao Lan versus Xue Ling ‘er. The two groups will be competing at the same time. ‘”‘
MO Xiu and Dong Fang looked at each other, and Dong Fang felt a headache coming on.
After coming to Yan Jing University, Dong Fang had spent the most time with MO Xiu. Not only were they roommates, but they had also done many missions together. Dong Fang was very clear about MO Xiu’s strength.
Dong Fang would rather face Xiao Lan than MO Xiu.
The four of them arrived at the arena. Just as Mu Mu announced the start of the match, Dong Fang turned around and walked out of the arena.
Mu Mu announced,”The first group, MO Xiu wins!””
“Why did you admit defeat?” MO Xiu asked in confusion. Aren’t you going to struggle?”
Dong Fang said proudly,” You all think I’m stupid, but I’m actually smart. You’ve been trying to get back at me for what happened to Yang Qingzhuo last time. If I don’t admit defeat today, I’ll definitely be beaten up. I, Dong Fang, won’t take this lying down.””
MO Xiu looked at Dong Fang’s smug expression and found it funny. “Alright, you’re the quick-witted one.”
This way, Moxiu finally had enough time to observe his opponent. In the previous matches, Moxiu had always fought until the end, so he rarely had such an opportunity.
MO Xiu and Dong Fang sat side by side at the side of the stadium, watching Xiao Lan and Xue Ling ‘er’s match.
The match had already begun. MO Xiu had seen Xiao Lan’s skill before. It was blue flames.
At this moment, Xiao Lan did not use any skills. The two women had been fighting each other since the start of the match.
Xue Ling ‘er was like her name. Her every move was quite agile, similar to Yang Qingzhuo’s.
Xiao Lan, on the other hand, was using a military style of combat. She didn’t make any unnecessary movements and attacked her vitals with every move.
Xiao Lan’s highly effective attack was still a notch above the others. She grabbed Xue Ling ‘er’s weakness and kicked her.
From MO Xiu’s point of view, the kick would definitely hit. The speed, strength, and angle of the kick was definitely not something Xue Ling ‘er could dodge.
However, just as Xiao Lan’s kick was about to land, Xue Ling ‘er’s speed increased to a terrifying level, turning into a blur to dodge the attack.
MO Xiu was stunned for a moment. In that instant, Xue Linger’s explosive speed was probably faster than Yang Qingzhuo’s skill. What was going on?
After dodging the attack, Xue Ling ‘er’s speed returned to normal.
In the following matches, Xue Ling ‘er used this method many times to dodge Xiao Lan’s attacks.
Moxiu didn’t use God’s Sight to check Xue Linger’s skill. Firstly, it wasn’t necessary. Secondly, he didn’t want to rely too much on the skill and wanted to maintain his judgment.
Based on his observations, MO Xiu felt that Xue Ling ‘er’s skill should be similar to a scouting skill. When she was about to be attacked, she would increase her speed to dodge or directly dodge.
Xue Ling ‘er didn’t lose, but Xiao Lan didn’t use her skills. She knew that she had no chance of winning, so she simply admitted defeat.
Mu Mu announced the results of the competition.
“Xiao Lan has won the second match. The top two teams have been decided. The captains of the two teams are MO Xiu and Xiao Lan. Tomorrow, the two of them will decide the champion and then choose their own team.”
When the few of them heard Mu Mu’s words, they thought that there was nothing else for today. Just as they were about to leave, Cao Fenglin, who had been silent all this while, spoke up.
“Mumu, gather all the members of the faculty for the preliminaries to watch the finals in the afternoon.”
Without waiting for MO Xiu to speak, Mu Mu asked, ‘”‘Teacher, will the finals be held this afternoon? Shouldn’t they let MO Xiu and Xiao Lan rest for a day?”
Cao Fenglin looked at the two of them and said,” They didn’t use any skills.
Why are they resting?” It’s settled then!”
MO Xiu sighed. Cao Fenglin was indeed Cao Fenglin, always in a rush.
Normally, the selection would last for fifteen days. If the other faculties were faster, it would probably take about ten days for the results to be out, right?
It was the 20th of July for the support-type. The finals would be held on the fifth day. Cao Fenglin would probably disappear and slack off in the remaining ten days.
Yang Qingzhuo had been waiting outside the door. When he saw MO Xiu come out, he immediately went up to him.
“MO Xiu, how was it? Did he win?”
MO Xiu nodded and said,”How can I not win against Dong Fang? Also, the finals were in the afternoon.”
“MO Xiu, you have to do your best! Don’t let anyone snatch me away!” Yang Qingzhuo said with a worried expression.”
Based on the rumors that had spread throughout the city, no one would choose Yang Qingzhuo except MO Xiu.
There was nothing much to do in the afternoon, so they returned to the martial arts field after lunch.
Because all the students from the department had come, the atmosphere was very lively. The students were discussing in groups of three to five.
They discussed who would win the championship and who MO Xiu and Xiao Lan would choose to join the team competition.
The moment MO Xiu entered, the entire place fell silent. The girls who had previously called MO Xiu a scumbag no longer had a disgusted expression on their faces.
A few girls even tried to flirt in front of MO Xiu, trying to attract his attention.
What if Moxiu chose them to join his team? Wouldn’t he be able to enter the school competition? With such results, it would be easy for him to find a job in the future.
Moxiu ignored them and walked straight to the center of the arena.
Some of the girls who couldn’t stand it said,” How shameless. You still want to seduce MO Xiu? Why don’t you take a look at yourself?” Is he as good-looking as Yang Qingzhuo?”
As the time approached, Cao Fenglin and Mu Mu also arrived at the venue.
Cao Fenglin picked up his megaphone and said,””Everyone, quiet down. MO Xiu and Xiao Lan, enter!”
MO Xiu had been standing in the middle of the arena the entire time. Xiao Lan had appeared out of nowhere.
Xiao Lan cupped her fists and said to MO Xiu,” Hello, I’ve long heard of your prowess. I can finally exchange blows with you today. ‘”‘
As she spoke, she lowered her head slightly, clearly feeling a little embarrassed. No matter how MO Xiu looked at her, Xiao Lan was like a little girl. She was like the difference between heaven and earth from her elder sister, Xiao Hong. Her younger sister was so obedient, but how could her elder sister be so unruly?
“Nice to meet you!” Moxiu replied.
Cao Fenglin said,” Let the competition begin!”
MO Xiu didn’t expect Cao Fenglin to call for the start so quickly. This was the finals after all. Shouldn’t he try to stir up the audience’s mood?
After that, Moxiu remembered that this was Cao Fenglin, not the host of the Underground Arena.
Moxiu immediately activated God’s Snooping.
[Skill 1: Mysterious Blue Flame 3]
[Skill Effect: The target will be surrounded by three blue flames. Each blue flame can increase speed, attack power, and defense by 100%. When attacked, the target can control the blue flames to block. The defense of the blue flames is five times that of the target.]
Blue Flame can be thrown to cause AOE damage. It cannot be retrieved after being thrown. [Duration: 15 minutes]
[Cooldown time: 1 hour]
Moxiu almost cursed out loud when he saw this. A Level 3 skill with a total of three blue flames meant that it increased his attack, defense, and speed by 300%.
This was the first time that Moxiu had seen a Skill that was comparable to the War God’s Descent. The War God’s Descent was even purer. It increased all Attributes and was a pure Warrior Skill.
As for the Mysterious Blue Flame, it was all-encompassing. It increased attributes, increased defense, and elemental damage. It could also be applied to others.
MO Xiu took a deep breath.. He knew that he might not win this time!

                    



Chapter 69: Fighting Xiao Lan

MO Xiu and Xiao Lan both knew how powerful their opponents were, so they didn’t let their guard down. The two of them immediately activated their skills.
Three balls of blue flames appeared around Xiao Lan’s body. The flames were moving irregularly.
The two of them seemed to have some kind of tacit understanding as they attacked at the same time.
MO Xiu took advantage of the moment when Xiao Lan was charging forward and didn’t manage to stand firm, and launched a thunderous attack.
Xiao Lan didn’t panic at all. She raised her right arm to block in front of her.
The blue flames also quickly moved to Xiao Lan’s arm.
Moxiu’s punch landed on the flames. After realizing this, Moxiu immediately retracted his fist and took a step back.
After looking at his fist, he didn’t feel the burning sensation that he had imagined. The blue flames seemed to have no temperature, unlike Wang Lei’s flaming armor, which was accompanied by high temperatures.
However, his defense was indeed astonishing. MO Xiu’s punch actually didn’t break through his defense. It seemed that if he wanted to defeat Xiao Lan, he would have to dodge the blue flames.
However, Xiao Lan’s fighting style was very similar to MO Xiu’s. They were both extremely simple moves that did not reveal a single flaw.
Every time they clashed, Xiao Lan would use Blue Flame to block. As time passed, MO Xiu actually used up more of his energy.
Xiao Lan would often use the blue flames to block attacks and free up her hands to counterattack.
What shocked MO Xiu the most was that according to his estimations, Xiao Lan’s basic physical fitness should be stronger than his.
This was simply inconceivable. A little girl’s body was actually so strong.
After Xiao Lan had gotten used to it for a while, she was able to fully control the three flames to defend herself. She then released her hands to attack without stopping.
In this way, it was equivalent to Xiao Lan having five hands. The speed and strength of the two of them were about the same. In this way, MO Xiu was instantly at a disadvantage.
Moxiu felt that his current offensive methods were too monotonous, completely relying on close combat. If this was the case, once he broke through his opponent’s defense, he would be helpless.
He had never met such a person before, but now he had appeared.
MO Xiu furrowed his brows as he pondered over how he could defeat Xiao Lan.
Regardless of whether it was the consumption or the duration of the skill, Moxiu was inferior to Xiao Lan. If this continued, he would only lose.
Moxiu swept his gaze across the audience and his eyes lit up. He smiled and continued to attack.
This time, MO Xiu attacked with both fists. Xiao Lan used two flames to block MO Xiu’s attack just like before.
Xiao Lan retaliated with a punch. MO Xiu did an extremely strange action. He swung his left arm and actually wrapped around Xiao Lan’s attacking arm, using this method to neutralize the attack.
Xiao Lan saw that her arm had been entangled and immediately pulled it back.
At the same time, Moxiu didn’t retract his hands. Instead, he continued to move. He changed his direction, his left fist attacking his face while his right fist went straight for his lower abdomen.
Xiao Lan did not expect MO Xiu to change his attack style. The blue flame moved quickly and blocked MO Xiu’s left fist that was aimed at her face, but it failed to block MO Xiu’s right fist.
MO Xiu’s right fist exerted force in the air for the second time and struck Xiao Lan’s lower abdomen. This was also MO Xiu’s first successful attack.
Xiao Lan took a few steps back before stopping. She stared fixedly at MO Xiu. “Are you using the Hu Family Fist Technique?”
MO Xiu nodded. When he looked at the audience, he saw Hu Xianming.
“What’s your relationship with the Hu family?” Xiao Lan asked with a frown.
How do you know the Hu Family Style?”
MO Xiu pointed at Hu Xianming and said,”She taught me!”
Xiao Lan looked at Hu Xianming in confusion. She didn’t understand why he was teaching MO Xiu fist techniques.
Hu Xianming stomped his feet in anger. This MO Xiu was simply spouting nonsense. Not only did he secretly learn his fist technique, but he also shamelessly boasted that he was the one who taught him!
MO Xiu didn’t give Xiao Lan much time to react. After all, the longer they dragged on, the more disadvantageous it would be for MO Xiu.
When they exchanged blows again, MO Xiu was even more skilled than before. He quickly entangled himself with Xiao Lan.
If Hu Xianming’s fist technique was like two tracking missiles, then MO Xiu’s fist technique was like two snakes.
Both of Xiao Lan’s arms were flexible like two snakes. As long as Xiao Lan threw a punch, her arms would be bound. Both of her fists were like the sharp teeth of a vicious snake, attacking Xiao Lan’s weak points continuously.
As a result, the situation on the field reversed. MO Xiu had the upper hand, while Xiao Lan was at a disadvantage.
Everyone present had different thoughts. MO Xiu had finally found a way to defeat Xiao Lan and was extremely happy.
Xiao Lan, on the other hand, was very annoyed. She had never seen such an annoying fist technique, making her feel like she couldn’t use it.
Hu Xianming was deep in thought. The fist technique MO Xiu was using now was no longer the Hu Family Fist Technique. It was a variant that amplified the Hu Family Fist Technique’s relentless pursuit, making it more clingy and both offensive and defensive.
Weakened, 2, Dash, Force, Only, Confirm, Able to hit the opponent, Time, Continue, 2, Dash, Force, Confirm attack, MO Xiu, Able to grasp the timing, Just like a monster.
Rather than saying that MO Xiu had learned the Hu Family Style wrongly, it would be better to say that MO Xiu had refined the Hu Family Style, making it more powerful and difficult to deal with.
At this thought, Hu Xianming couldn’t care less anymore. He immediately ran out of the door and dialed his father’s number.
Cao Fenglin nodded his head slightly. He felt that Moxiu wasn’t a simple person. Skills determined a person’s innate talent, but wasn’t combat talent the same?
However, the audience had different thoughts from these people. As the saying goes, experts look at the tricks and laymen look at the fun. This was the auxiliary system. The vast majority of people did not know martial arts and were not very good at fighting.
In their eyes, Moxiu’s sticky and physical approach was clearly a way to take advantage of the situation.
However, no one dared to call MO Xiu a scumbag now. If they offended MO Xiu, MO Xiu would not consider them when he chose his teammates. At the very least, they still had a chance.
In the arena, Xiao Lan was covered in injuries from head to toe after this period of attacks. Fortunately, MO Xiu’s fighting style was unable to use his full strength, so Xiao Lan’s injuries were not serious.
But even so, Xiao Lan had consumed a lot of her energy. Her stamina was somewhat unable to hold on. If this continued, she would be defeated in less than a minute.
At this point, MO Xiu became even more vigilant because Xiao Lan still had a trump card that she had yet to use.
Xiao Lan’s blue flames could be shot out to cause elemental damage.
Thus, Moxiu was now staring at the three balls of flames, ready to dodge at any moment.
Due to Moxiu’s distraction, his attacks weren’t as sharp as before.
To MO Xiu’s surprise, Xiao Lan admitted defeat a minute later. Xiao Lan raised her right hand and said to Cao Fenglin,””Teacher, I admit defeat!”
MO Xiu felt very disappointed. Why did he admit defeat at this time? Xiao Lan clearly still had a trump card.
Cao Fenglin was also stunned for a moment before saying,””Alright, the champion of the finals has appeared. Moxiu is the winner!”
“Why did you admit defeat?” Moxiu asked in confusion. You can still hold on for a while.”
Xiao Lan smiled and said elegantly, “If we continue fighting, I’ll lose too. There’s no need for that. I admit that I’m not as good as you.”
MO Xiu was still unwilling to give up.””But how do you know that if you hold on a little longer, my skill won’t enter its cooldown period?”
“Then how do you know that my skill won’t enter cooldown before yours?” Xiao Lan asked. You win, Moxiu. Congratulations!”
MO Xiu shook his head and sighed. For some unknown reason, Xiao Lan did not use her trump card and was willing to admit defeat just like that.
While the two were talking, Yang Qingzhuo, He Lingyue, and Dong Fang rushed into the arena to celebrate MO Xiu’s victory.
Yang Qingzhuo tugged at MO Xiu’s sleeve and said, “Mo Xiu, you must definitely choose me!”
MO Xiu saw Yang Qingzhuo’s expression and nodded. “Good! I said I would choose you, and I will!”

                    



Chapter 70: Choosing You

“Don’t worry! I said I’d choose you, and I’ll choose you!”
When the match ended, there were no cheers from the crowd. Instead, the entire stadium fell silent.
This was because what everyone cared about the most was not who would be the champion, but who MO Xiu and Xiao Lan would choose to be teammates.
Cao Fenglin and Mu Mu walked to the center of the arena. Mu Mu said to MO
Xiu,””Moxiu, you are the champion. You can choose your four teammates first.”
MO Xiu tapped on the screen, and the entire crowd fell silent. Everyone was afraid that they would miss out on their own names.
“Yang Qingzhuo! ”
When the little follower heard her name, she jumped up excitedly. If not for the fact that there were too many people present, she would have kissed MO Xiu.
No one was surprised that MO Xiu chose Yang Qingzhuo. Awesome! The picture of the movie was now a household name.
“He Lingyue!”
MO Xiu chose her according to his agreement with He Lingyue. It wasn’t purely because of their friendship. He Lingyue’s skill, Future, was indeed very strong as a support.
“Dong Fang!”
The reason why MO Xiu chose Dong Fang was very simple. It was very difficult to find a power attack system in the support system. Too many support systems would not be strong.
There was only one spot left. Everyone held their breaths.
MO Xiu looked at Xiao Lan and said,”l’m sorry.”‘
Xiao Lan did not understand what MO Xiu meant at first, but when she heard the last name MO Xiu said, she was stunned.
“Hu Xianming! ”
Even Xiao Lan was a little unhappy. MO Xiu’s interference was simply snatching away her beloved.
Hu Xianming had just finished his phone call and returned to the stadium when he heard his name.
After a moment of reaction, he stood behind MO Xiu like Yang Qingzhuo, He Lingyue, and Dong Fang.
After MO Xiu finished choosing, Xiao Lan also began to choose her own team members.
The process was also very fast. It seemed that Xiao Lan had already made up her mind.
Only now did MO Xiu realize that he didn’t recognize the people Xiao Lan had chosen.
After thinking about it carefully, he realized that MO Xiu and Xiao Lan had advanced in two different ways. MO Xiu had chosen people he was familiar with or people he had met in the competition.
Xiao Lan was the same. In other words, the seemingly unreasonable competition schedule would efficiently select the four strongest people from everyone, and then use the two strongest people as the core to form a team. The core would choose people who were beneficial to them or had a tacit understanding of each other.
At the thought of this, Moxiu couldn’t help but carefully size up Cao Fenglin. This man who seemed to be able to do everything at will should have great wisdom.
Seeing that MO Xiu and Xiao Lan had chosen their teammates, Mu Mu once again announced the name list for the next round.
Then, he said to Moxiu,”Moxiu, your champion reward will be delivered to your dormitory tonight.’”‘
MO Xiu nodded in response. At this point, the selection competition within the faculty had come to an end.
There was a wave of sighs from the crowd. Everyone was feeling regretful that they did not advance.
Cao Fenglin said,” There’s still ten days left until the selection. The remaining students will undergo the second round of selection at the venue next door!’”‘
MO Xiu didn’t understand. The list of people who had advanced was already out. Given Cao Fenglin’s character, why would he be re-selected?
Cao Fenglin looked at everyone’s puzzled expressions and continued,””Have you all forgotten that each team can have eight people, five main players and three substitutes? The second selection will choose a total of six substitutes from the others.”
After that, Cao Fenglin told everyone else to take note of some things. After everyone who had advanced stayed behind, the others left.
Only Cao Fenglin and Mu Mu were left in the arena, as well as the ten people who had advanced.
Cao Fenglin said to everyone,” For the next ten days, all of you have to come here every morning to train. You have to prepare for the internal battles. The training will be hosted by Mu Mu. I have already told Mu Mu Mu all the training methods. ”
“Teacher, Mu Mu is training us. What are you going to do?” Dong Fang asked casually.”
Cao Fenglin pointed at Dong Fang. I have to choose a substitute for you.”
Cao Fenglin left after he finished speaking. Mu Mu stayed behind to discuss some matters with the others.
MO Xiu sighed with emotion. Mu Mu had suddenlv become an instructor.
After Mu Mu briefly explained the things to take note of, he announced the time of all the competitions.
MO Xiu had listed the time of the internal competition and the club competition together. It seemed like he would be busy in the following days.
August 1st, the preliminaries of the individual duels.
August 15th, the preliminaries of the individual club duels.
September 1st, the preliminaries of the team competition.
September 15th, preliminaries of the team competition.
October 1st, club duel.
November 1st, the school’s one-on-one competition.
December 1st, team competition.
January 1st, team competition.
The competition would last until January next year. Next would probably be the competition between the major universities. This way, the competition would last throughout the year. Yanjing University’s competition education was indeed not for nothing.
Overall, the competition was mainly an internal competition. The club competition was more like a competition that used all the free time.
After Mu Mu finished explaining, it was already night time. MO Xiu and the others ate a mouthful of rice before returning to the dormitory.
When he returned to the dormitory, he found that someone had already delivered the Heart Cleansing Wood and was waiting at the door.
MO Xiu went up to him and opened the door for the staff to help him put the Heart-Cleansing Wood into his room.
After the staff left, Dong Fang opened the big box in front of him.
The Heart Cleansing Wood was like a small tree but had no roots. The trunk was about 30 centimeters in diameter and 1.5 meters tall. It was shaped like a coconut tree.
Before MO Xiu could go forward to check, a black shadow flashed past MO Xiu and hugged the Clear Heart Wood.
He took a closer look and realized that it was Yang Qingzhuo. Yang Qingzhuo didn’t go back to his own dorm but secretly followed MO Xiu’s dorm. He wanted to see the Heart Cleansing Wood.
When MO Xiu walked within a meter of the Clear Heart Wood, he instantly felt relaxed and refreshed. His mind became much clearer, and he felt as if he had activated the Descent of the Martial God.
MO Xiu tugged at Yang Qingzhuo, who was holding the Heart-Cleansing Wood, and said,”Little follower, you should leave quickly. If you like it, I can lend you this Clear Heart Wood for a few days.”
But no matter how hard MO Xiu tried, Yang Qingzhuo refused to let go.
After another hour, MO Xiu was about to fall asleep. He couldn’t let Yang Qingzhuo stay any longer.
MO Xiu used a forceful method to pull Yang Qingzhuo out from under the Clear
Heart Wood.
When they reached the door, Yang Qingzhuo said angrily,””Mo Xiu, you’re so petty. I can’t even stay here for a while!”
MO Xiu grabbed Yang Qingzhuo’s clothes by the back of his neck and lifted him up.
“Don’t talk nonsense. The dormitory clearly states that men and women are not allowed to stay in the same dormitory.”
He turned around and opened the door, giving MO Xiu a fright.
An old face looked at MO Xiu expressionlessly. MO Xiu had almost bumped into him just now.
This person was the old man downstairs. It seemed that he had been standing here for a long time. In other words, he had heard everything that was said through the door.
“Sir, why are you here?” Moxiu asked awkwardly.”
“You’ve brought the little girl into your dormitory for so long, and you’re still asking me why I’m here?” Sir System snorted coldly..”

                    



Chapter 71: Shocking Tactics

MO Xiu said,” Sir, I obtained a Heart Cleansing Wood today. This little fellow wants to take a look. There’s nothing else. ‘”‘
As he spoke, MO Xiu dragged Yang Qingzhuo towards the door.
Sir System looked at the two of them. They did not seem like people who would do anything out of line.
“You’re the champion of the support department?” MO Xiu nodded.
“Who is in charge of the support system this time?”
“It’s Teacher Cao Fenglin, ” replied MO Xiu.”
“Cao Fenglin?” Sir System asked in surprise.”
Moxiu did not understand why Sir System was so surprised and could only nod again.
After that, Sir System asked Cao Fenglin about the selection method and the subsequent arrangements.
When Moxiu finished, Sir System nodded and said,”Hmm, not bad. It seems that the support system is very strong this year. If I were you, I would rent a house outside the school and gather all your companions.”
MO Xiu suddenly felt that his idea was feasible. After sending off First Master and Yang Qingzhuo, MO Xiu returned to his room to sleep.
The next morning, MO Xiu woke up feeling refreshed. He looked at the Heart-Cleansing Wood beside him. It was indeed useful.
The Heart-Cleansing Wood would continue to grow. It mainly relied on absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy to slowly grow and transform it into spiritual energy that was useful to people.
MO Xiu touched the trunk of the Heartwood. The Heartwood emitted an extremely weak light as if it was responding.
Martial arts field number three.
The advanced teams, Team Moxiu and Team Xiao Lan, arrived on time.
Mu Mu had been waiting for a long time.
Seeing that everyone had arrived, Mu Mu took out a folder and opened it, then closed it.
“Everyone, please give me your guidance. My combat ability is not as good as yours, but Teacher Cao Fenglin said that I have the talent to be a teacher. In the next ten days, I might be the one helping everyone train.”
Mu Mu bowed. His actions and words were filled with humility.
Everyone was very familiar with Mu Mu, so of course, they wouldn’t refuse to cooperate just because Mu Mu was a classmate.
According to MO Xiu’s observation skill, it was similar to He Lingyue’s, but it wasn’t as abnormal as Future. It was probably a detection skill that could see through other people’s weaknesses, which was suitable for coaching.
MO Xiu was the champion of the Support Division, and he had the most authority among everyone. Mu Mu was an old classmate, so he naturally supported him.
“Director Mu, we believe in your ability. Tell us about our training today.” Mu Mu smiled and nodded at MO Xiu, understanding his kindness.
“The training arrangements for the future are like this. We will have actual combat training in the morning and special intensive training in the afternoon. Since today is the first day, we will give everyone time to adapt.”
“How do we fight?” asked MO Xiu.”
“It’s very simple. Team MO Xiu versus Team Xiao Lan. You guys choose your own team members. Today, we’ll see how well you guys work together.”
MO Xiu and Xiao Lan glanced at each other. They were about to engage in their second duel so soon.
“The rules of the competition are very simple. The field is 100 meters square. If you leave the circle or lose your combat ability, you will be eliminated. If there is no opponent on the field, you will win.”
While they were discussing tactics, a strange scene occurred.
Xiao Lan’s group of five was having an intense discussion. Many of them made suggestions and occasionally glanced at MO Xiu. It seemed like they had quite a few plans.
On Moxiu’s side, it was exactly the opposite. Moxiu gathered the other four people over and said only one sentence. The others nodded one after another. After that, the five of them sat quietly at the side. Some of them were playing with their phones, while others were watching Xiao Lan’s movements.
MO Xiu was even more overboard. He directly sat down and closed his eyes to rest.
The more Xiao Lan’s team watched, the angrier they became. Wasn’t this looking down on them? Instead, they began to discuss tactics even more intensely, wanting to defeat Team Moxiu.
Time flew by, and half an hour passed quickly. Mu Mu announced the start of the competition.
“Let the competition begin!”
As soon as he finished speaking, Moxiu opened his eyes and quickly entered battle mode.
The five members of Team Moxiu fought in a row without any rules.
On the other hand, Xiao Lan was standing at the very front, with two people standing in the middle and another two standing at the back. It was obvious that this was a carefully planned plan.
At the start of the match, Xiao Lan didn’t make any moves. Except for Xiao Lan’s release of skills, everyone else was waiting for an opportunity to make a move.
MO Xiu’s attack was simple and brutal. Three rays of light appeared on MO Xiu’s body. His Descent of the Martial God, Yang Qingzhuo’s Seraphic Speed, and He Lingyue’s Future were all cast on MO Xiu.
Moxiu felt an unprecedented power and immediately launched a lightning-like attack.
Xiao Lan originally thought that MO Xiu would directly go after her. She didn’t expect MO Xiu to use his speed advantage to skip her and head straight for the four people behind him.
Xiao Lan knew that something was wrong. She immediately turned around and wanted to give chase. However, at this moment, a figure appeared in front of her.
Dong Fang…
As the meat shield of MO Xiu’s team, Dong Fang naturally stood in front of Xiao Lan.
Xiao Lan ignored him. She wanted to shake off Dong Fang with her speed, but she didn’t expect Dong Fang, this big guy, to actually be able to keep up with her.
This was actually the reason why Yang Qingzhuo had cast his Godly Speed on Dong Fang.
Seeing that she could not shake off Dong Fang, Xiao Lan could only defeat him. No matter how fat Dong Fang was, he was not Xiao Lan’s match.
After two moves, Xiao Lan thought that she could defeat Dong Fang. Just as she was about to injure Dong Fang, a white light appeared on Dong Fang’s body and negated the damage.
Xiao Lan was extremely familiar with this skill. It was Hu Xianming’s Holy
Light.
Xiao Lan turned to look at Hu Xianming, who was looking at her apologetically.
With Hu Xianming’s skills, Xiao Lan knew that she couldn’t defeat Dong Fang in a short time. She made a prompt decision and turned around to attack He Lingyue, Yang Qingzhuo, and Hu Xianming.
If you cut into my backseat, I’ll cut into yours.
Xiao Lan’s movements were extremely fast. Dong Fang did not even have time to react before he turned around and ran away.
Just as Xiao Lan was about to attack He Lingyue, who was the weakest, a figure flashed and blocked in front of Xiao Lan.
MO Xiu!
It was MO Xiu!
Xiao Lan couldn’t believe it. Why was MO Xiu back? Could it be?
He turned around and saw that all four of Xiao Lan’s teammates had been eliminated. The four of them looked at Xiao Lan regretfully.
Xiao Lan turned her head and looked at MO Xiu in disbelief. Her team had clearly set up a foolproof strategy just now. How could it be so easily broken by MO Xiu?
MO Xiu didn’t attack directly. Instead, he asked,’”‘Do you still want to continue?”
Xiao Lan decisively admitted defeat. Under normal circumstances, she might not even be a match for MO Xiu. Right now, MO Xiu was still in all sorts of conditions. It was impossible for him to win. Mu Mu clapped his hands and said, “Excellent match. Team MO Xiu has won.”” After that, Mu Mu summarized the match.
“Team Blue Xiao had many misgivings. When the unexpected situation occurred, everyone didn’t make the correct response. Just now, when Moxiu charged over alone, you should have immediately shrunk your formation and used five against one, wasting such a good formation.”
“The members of Team Moxiu clearly have a lot of tacit understanding. Everyone knows when to do what. Although the tactics are simple, they are concise and effective.”
A member of Xiao Lan’s team asked unwillingly,””Moxiu, your team doesn’t even have any tactics, so how can you cooperate so well?”
“Who says we don’t have any tactics?” Moxiu shrugged. I’ve already laid out the battle strategy.”
Xiao Lan’s team of five and Mu Mu all looked at MO Xiu. When they were setting up the battle strategy, MO Xiu had clearly only said one sentence. Moxiu extended three fingers and said, “Our strategy is only three words!””
Everyone was puzzled.
“Four for one!”

                    



Chapter 72: Xiao Family, Imperial Family!_l

After the morning training ended, MO Xiu called Liu Ziyang to the dormitory at noon.
“Boss!” Liu Ziyang asked as soon as he entered. What’s wrong? Why are you looking for me?”
MO Xiu brought Liu Ziyang to his bedroom and pointed at the Heart Cleansing
Wood.”This is the reward for our department’s champion!”
Liu Ziyang looked left and right and said,” Boss, I knew you won last night. I just didn’t have time to call you. Is this what you get for the championship?””
“Uh… That’s right!”
“I thought it was something good. I sleep with this thing every night!”
MO Xiu had almost forgotten that Liu Ziyang had grown up with a golden spoon in his mouth and had endless resources since he was a child.
However, it was also difficult for Liu Ziyang to have such a high IQ. He had grown up with the Heart Cleansing Wood as his pillow.
“Oh right, since your family is so powerful, why is your skill only at Level 2?” Moxiu asked curiously.”
Liu Ziyang scratched his head and said,” It’s all because of my dad. My dad said that it’s best not to use drugs to upgrade skills. Even if the skill level is upgraded, the understanding of the skill is not up to standard.””
MO Xiu nodded his head, Liu Ziyang’s father said that it was very reasonable, it was very important to understand the skill.
“Boss, why did you call me here?” Liu Ziyang asked. Don’t tell me you’re just showing off your Heart Cleansing Wood? You’re not that kind of person.”
MO Xiu asked Liu Ziyang to sit down and slowly explained.
“Actually, I have something to ask you.”
“What is it?”
“What is the background of the Xiao family? Xiao Hong, Xiao Lan, and the Xiao Qing I pretended to be last time.”
When Liu Ziyang heard this question, his expression became serious.
“Boss, I can tell you about this, but it’s a serious matter. You can’t tell anyone.”
“Don’t worry. Don’t you trust me?” MO Xiu patted his chest.”
“Actually, the Xiao family is the Imperial family!”
” The royal family?!
Moxiu was extremely shocked. This was the first time he had come into contact with the imperial clan. In the past, he had only heard of it, and it was rarely mentioned in books.
The reason why MO Xiu cared so much about the Royal Family was because Elder Tang had said that the Royal Family had talent skills!
Liu Ziyang widened his eyes and covered MO Xiu’s mouth.”Boss, keep your voice down. It’s fine to discuss the royal family, but everything about the royal family is basically a secret. Only a few people know!”
MO Xiu slapped Liu Ziyang’s hand away and said,””Alright, tell me the details! ”
“Yes, yes, the Xiao family is a royal family, but they are also a fallen royal family. Otherwise, the royal family wouldn’t have come to Yan Jing University to study.”
“Imperial clan? Down and out?”
MO Xiu didn’t understand. How could the royal family fall?
“Yes, the second generation of the Xiao family, Xiao Hong’s father, didn’t have very strong skills, so he fell.”
“But I can see that Xiao Hong and Xiao Lan are both very talented!” MO Xiu nodded.”
‘Yes, there are three people in the third generation of the Xiao family. The
eldest sister, xlao Hong, tne second sister, xlao Lan, ancl tne tmrcl Drotner, Xiao Qing. Other than Xiao Qing, who is ignorant and incompetent, the two older sisters are very strong, especially Xiao Hong.”
MO Xiu understood. This explained why Xiao Lan’s skills were so perverse, and why her battle style was military-style.
“Tell me more details!”
“Boss, how can you be specific? Checking the household register? Do you like these two sisters? As your brother, I have to advise you to control yourself. You have Mu Qingyi, and now you have Yang Qingzhuo. Do you still want Xiao…” MO Xiu helplessly extended his right hand to interrupt Liu Ziyang.
“Alright, I don’t want to know about the Xiao family. I want to know about the imperial family. I’m very interested!”
When Liu Ziyang heard this, his eyes instantly lit up. Then, he lowered his head and shut his mouth tightly.
He was like a child who knew some gossip but knew not to spread it easily.
“Tell me, even if you don’t, have you forgotten my relationship with Elder Tang?” MO Xiu’s eyes moved. I’ll ask him when the time comes, and he’ll tell me, but I can’t find him now.”
Liu Ziyang let down his guard.
“Alright, I’ll tell you. You definitely won’t be able to imagine the origin of the imperial family!”
“The imperial family’s surname is Xiao?”
“No, I can’t! The imperial family doesn’t have a fixed surname. The imperial family isn’t one family, but is made up of many families…”
In the next hour, Liu Ziyang explained Royal from all aspects. Moxiu was shocked. Royal had always represented the Alliance’s strongest fighting strength, but no matter how he thought about it, he never expected Royal to be like this.
Everything originated from the meteorite ‘Origin’, so after the’ Origin’, which generation received the most care from the ‘Origin’?
Was it someone who had lived in the era of spiritual energy explosion since he was young?
Or was it that when the Origin descended, the people who were exposed to radiation were called the First Generation, and the First Generation was the strongest existence?
Neither. Liu Ziyang mentioned a concept that shocked MO Xiu. It was the ‘Holy Sage’!
The so-called ‘Holy Son’ was actually very easy to understand. It was the baby that was still in the mother’s womb when the ‘Origin’ descended.
They were blessed and experienced the first radiation. They grew up in the Reiki Era, just like the people brought to Earth by the ‘Origin’.
In the beginning, the various countries did not know about it and were caught in a bitter battle with the wild beasts. However, when the generation of the Son of God reached the age of 18 and awakened their skills, everyone knew that it was up to them to repel the wild beasts and protect the human territory.
That generation was gathered together and specially protected. It was only when they grew up that they repelled all the wild beasts and signed a contract.
However, due to the carelessness of the humans, Beast discovered the existence of the Saint. Beast used spies to launch a sneak attack, and more than half of the Saint was killed or injured!
In the war, another portion of the ‘Holy Sons’ died. The remaining ‘Holy Sons’ and their descendants were called the imperial family.
Until now, the imperial family was the core of the alliance and the strongest fighting force.
“I heard from Elder Tang that some members of the royal family have innate skills. Do you know?” asked MO Xiu.”
Liu Ziyang nodded and said,” I’ve heard of it from my grandfather, but I’ve never seen it before. I don’t know what an innate skill is.””
Moxiu fell into deep thought. Could it be that his passive skill, Reversal, was really a Royal’s innate skill?
However, he had been a poor boy since he was young. What did he have to do with the imperial family?
“Boss! Boss!”
Liu Ziyang pulled MO Xiu back from his thoughts. “What? Where were we?”
“We’re done talking. You’re so strange today.”
‘ Alright,” Moxiu said with a faint smile.” You can go back first. Thank you for clearing my doubts.’”‘
Just like that, Liu Ziyang inexplicably came and left. When he left, he still didn’t know why MO Xiu had asked him to come.
After sending Liu Ziyang off, MO Xiu sat alone under the Clear Heart Wood and pondered.
What was his relationship with the imperial family? Could it be his missing father? However, MO Xiu didn’t want to mention this to his mother.
Every time her father was mentioned, her mother, Li Yuan, would appear to be in great pain.
No matter what, it was not a bad thing for him to have a god-level skill like the flip. If nothing unexpected happened, after Moxiu awakened all of his skills, he would have eight skills, four more than an ordinary person. This was definitely a terrifying existence.
He wondered what the other imperial families ‘innate skills were. Was he also this powerful?
Oh right, when he checked on Xiao Lan previously, he didn’t see any innate skills? Could it be that there was a genetic problem??

                    



Chapter 73: The Sudden Arrival of Elder Tang

MO Xiu was still in a daze when someone knocked on the door.
After opening the door, MO Xiu was stunned. It was actually his cheap master, Elder Tang. This was even faster than Cao Cao!
“Master. Master, how did you find me?”
Elder Tang pushed Moxiu away and walked into the dormitory to look around. “Your dormitory is not good enough. Go out and rent a room.”
“I’m a little short on money right now. Master, why don’t you…” Moxiu said awkwardly.
Elder Tang rolled his eyes at MO Xiu. This disciple of his was really difficult to deal with. The second time they met, he wanted to make him bleed again. Elder Tang punched MO Xiu’s head, causing him to squat on the ground in pain.
“Aiyo, Master, what are you doing?”
“Brat, you’re trying to extort me the moment I arrived! But it’s okay, I’ve already prepared a house for you. I have a villa in Yanjing. It’s empty, so you can stay there.”
Mr. Tang said as he threw a file to Moxiu.
“Here are the keys and the transfer documents. I’ve already asked someone to settle it for you. You can move in directly!”
MO Xiu’s face, which was still bitter from being slapped, suddenly lit up with a smile.
“Master, you’re really thoughtful!” he said with a thumbs up. He didn’t expect
Master to care about his disciple all the time. His disciple was so grateful!” Mr. Tang held back his laughter and said,” Stop flattering me. Move over immediately. I have something to entrust to you!””
MO Xiu was stunned for a moment. It seemed like this old man wasn’t that kind.
“What is it?”
“I’ll tell you when you move in. Hurry up. I’ll look for you at the villa tonight.”
After saying that, Elder Tang was about to leave. MO Xiu quickly stopped Elder
Tang and said, “Hey, hey, hey. Master, can I let others live in that villa?”
Mr. Tang stroked his beard with his right hand and seemed to be thinking seriously.
“Sure! But it must be someone trustworthy, understand?”
MO Xiu saw Elder Tang’s serious expression and immediately stopped smiling. He replied seriously,””Yes, I understand.”
Mr. Tang left. Although Moxiu said that he understood, he didn’t really understand. Why did a villa need trustworthy people to move in?
MO Xiu couldn’t figure it out. This cheap master had always given MO Xiu a mysterious feeling.
They did not know his identity, the purpose of taking him in as a disciple, or even his whereabouts.
But no matter what, this master still took good care of Moxiu. He sent Moxiu into the cosmic tuition class and gave him a villa and a black kylin.
Although he didn’t do anything that a master should do, he did what a master should do.
Since his master had already given a death order, MO Xiu did not dare to disobey. He could only immediately move and start moving.
Moving a house required a large cart to carry things. Everything else was fine, but the Heart Cleansing Wood was not easy to move. Ordinary carts could not fit it.
MO Xiu directly dialed Liu Yang’s number. “Hello? Boss, what is it now? Don’t tell me you want to talk to me again?”
“No, I want to move. Can you help me arrange it?”
“Where are we moving to?”
“Wait a moment, let me see…
MO Xiu opened the bag that Elder Tang gave him and read the address on it. “Cloud Top Villa Complex, 18th floor, 15th building.”
“Ah? Boss, are you kidding me? Was it really the Yunding Villa Complex? 18th floor?”
MO Xiu looked at it carefully again and said, “There’s no mistake! ‘”‘
MO Xiu heard Liu Ziyang taking a deep breath on the other end of the phone.
“Hiss! Whoosh! How did you get this villa?”
“Master gave it to me casually!” MO Xiu answered truthfully.”
“Master?” “Elder Tang!”
” F * ck!!!”
MO Xiu only finished moving at night, and Liu Ziyang was busy with his work.
When MO Xiu arrived at the Cloud Top Villa Complex and saw the spectacular scene, he finally understood why Liu Ziyang was so surprised.
The entire villa area was built on a hill. The foot of the hill had one floor, and the top had eighteen floors.
Liu Ziyang’s family lived on the 16th floor, so he was very familiar with it. There were security guards on every floor.
According to Liu Ziyang, the villas here could not be bought with money. The higher the floor, the higher the status.
Even with the power of the Liu family, they could only live on the 16th floor because the entire 17th floor was occupied by the relatives of the imperial family.
The elevator went straight to the eighteenth floor. Moxiu felt that this place was like a paradise, peaceful and quiet. As he was at the top of the mountain, he could see the clouds within reach.
It was also Liu Ziyang’s first time coming up. He seemed to be a little smug and kept taking photos.
“Liu Ziyang, why are you taking pictures?”
Liu Ziyang said proudly,” Boss, you don’t understand. I can brag about these photos in the circle for three days and three nights. Otherwise, I’ll be awesome when I bring you to a party next time.’”‘
MO Xiu naturally understood that the circle that Liu Ziyang was talking about must be the circle of wealthy children.
“Forget it, I’m not interested.”
Liu Ziyang didn’t let MO Xiu’s words dampen his spirits and continued taking selfies.
MO Xiu said,” Liu Ziyang, I’ve been in Beijing for almost a month, but I haven’t visited your father yet. This is a good opportunity. Why don’t I visit him today?’”‘
Liu Ziyang nodded vigorously. He couldn’t wait for MO Xiu to go now. His father had always said that he was useless since he was young. This time, he brought back a friend like MO Xiu.
In Liu Ziyang’s opinion, his father would definitely praise him.
MO Xiu followed Liu Ziyang to the Liu Residence on the sixteenth floor. It was already eight o’clock at night. Although it was a little abrupt, it was better than not coming at all. They had all moved nearby.
After entering, she found out that Mr. Liu had a very important business meeting to discuss today and was not at home at the moment.
However, Mother Liu still warmly received MO Xiu and asked him to stay at home for dinner. After dinner, she asked Liu Ziyang to send MO Xiu back.
After MO Xiu left, Mother Liu said to Liu Ziyang, “Son, you’ve finally made a good friend. You’re finally not a bunch of scoundrels anymore. I think this kid is not bad. You said he’s also in the Cloud Top Villa Complex. You have to interact more with him.”
Liu Ziyang said excitedly,” Mom, MO Xiu is on the 18th floor. He’s awesome, right? He’s Elder Tang’s disciple!’”‘
‘What?” Mother Liu was shocked. Level 18? Master Tang’s disciple?”
After saying that, he turned around and entered the house. Liu Ziyang asked, “Mom, what’s wrong?”
Mrs. Liu said angrily,” You damned child. Why didn’t you say so earlier? I didn’t treat you well enough. I’ll call your father now!””
MO Xiu returned to the villa on the 18th floor. He didn’t take a closer look when he was moving. He just left his things at the door and went to the Liu residence.
The villa only had three floors including the basement, but there was a huge living room. The moment he entered, he felt like he was in a square.
There were more than ten rooms on the first and second floors. MO Xiu didn’t open them one by one. He randomly found a room on the second floor to use as his bedroom.
After that, he walked around and waited for Mr. Tang to arrive. First, he went to the backyard. There was a very large swimming pool in the backyard, surrounded by plants.
They entered the basement. The basement was very large. Moxiu had thought that it was an underground garage.
After walking around, he realized that there were no signs of living in this villa. All the furniture was new, and there were no other items.
It seemed that Mr. Tang hadn’t stayed in this villa since he owned it.
Moxiu finally arrived at the rooftop. The rooftop was like a training ground with a spacious space and pleasant scenery.
There was a rocking chair in the corner of the rooftop. MO Xiu felt very comfortable sitting on it and unknowingly fell asleep.
“Brat! You didn’t say that you were welcoming me when I came, but you slept here!”

                    



Chapter 74: Little Fushun

MO Xiu opened his eyes and saw Elder Tang looking straight at him.
“Master, you’re here. I accidentally fell asleep.”
“Brat, come with me. I have something to tell you.”
MO Xiu perked up. This master was finally going to take responsibility. Could it be that he was going to pass down a peerless divine technique?
After they went downstairs, the two of them sat on the sofa. Moxiu looked at Mr. Tang with anticipation.
Elder Tang took out something from his pocket and handed it to MO Xiu.
MO Xiu took it and took a look. This was…Kitten?
The creature in Moxiu’s hand was only the size of a palm. It was furry, had large tearful eyes, and had a beard. Wasn’t this the cat recorded by the predecessors?
Also, this little thing was taken out from Mr. Tang’s pocket.
“Master, this is…” MO Xiu asked. What do you mean?”
“Isn’t this little guy cute?”
Moxiu looked at the little fellow. His dull eyes and slow movements were indeed very cute.
MO Xiu nodded.
Elder Tang smiled and said,” Hehe, it’s good that he’s cute. I’ll leave this little guy in your care in the future.’”‘
MO Xiu pointed at himself and said,””Me? Raise it?”
“Yes, you raise it!”
The concept of a pet had long since disappeared. MO Xiu thought that Old Master Tang wanted him to raise this little guy as his son.
“But I…” MO Xiu said with a bitter face.
Elder Tang glared at him, and MO Xiu immediately swallowed his words. This was considered coercion!
“I’ll leave it to you to raise!”
MO Xiu could only accept his fate and weakly said, “‘What’s its name? Is it a man or a woman?”
“No name. I picked it up. It’s a boy.”
“Since you picked him up, give him a name!”
Old Master Tang thought for a while and said,” This little guy is lucky. I hope he can have a smooth life. How about Little Fushun?’”‘
Moxiu’s eyes widened. Didn’t you stay in the library for many years? Wasn’t it claimed to be able to understand every single individual? Is this the level of education after reading so many books? He gave it such a name.
“What’s wrong?” Old Master Tang glared again. Are you not satisfied with the name I gave you?”
“No, I didn’t mean that at all,” Moxiu quickly said.”
“That’s good. If you’re not dissatisfied, then it’s settled. I’ll be called Little Fushun! ”
“Eh?” Old Master Tang said confidently. Little Fushun is very obedient. Don’t worry, he’ll stay in my pocket the whole way.”
“But…”
Before he could finish speaking, MO Xiu felt the spot where Little Fu Shun was lying on his lap heat up.
Moxiu lifted it up and saw that there was a sticky mess on his leg. He had pooped on his leg.
MO Xiu looked at Elder Tang, implying that this was what he meant by obedient.
“Hahaha, perhaps it’s because of the long journey that Little Fushun caught a cold and had diarrhea.” Elder Tang laughed heartily.”
MO Xiu placed Little Fu on the sofa and wanted to go to the bathroom to take a shower and change his clothes. “Master, I’m going to take a shower.”
Elder Tang nodded.
MO Xiu went to the bedroom on the second floor and took out a set of clothes. He then went into the bathroom, and Little Fushun followed him along the way.
Little Fushun was too young, so he couldn’t walk properly. He even jumped up the stairs.
“Don’t follow me. Wait downstairs.” MO Xiu turned around and said to Little Fu Shun.”
Little Fu Shun raised his head and looked at MO Xiu’s eyes as if he understood.
Moxiu found it interesting.” Alright,” he said.” If you understand, then go downstairs and wait.’”‘
MO Xiu took two steps and turned around to see that Little Fu Shun was still following him.
“Sigh, it seems like you don’t understand.”
Moxiu ignored Little Fushun and went to take a shower first. He couldn’t walk around in his pants that had feces on them, right?
She quickly took a shower and came out to find Little Fushun waiting at the bathroom door.
He was originally lying lazily on the ground. When he saw MO Xiu come out, he immediately got up and raised his head high, still looking into MO Xiu’s eyes.
‘ Let’s go,” MO Xiu said.” Come downstairs with me. Let’s see if we can persuade Master to take you away. I’ll support you. You can…”
MO Xiu’s eyes twitched. When he went downstairs, he saw that Elder Tang had already left.
This master was too unreliable.
She turned around and looked at Little Fushun, who was still following behind her, and held him in her hands.
“Alright, now that you can’t leave, I’ll find you a room.”
Little Fu Shun squinted his eyes in Moxiu’s palm. Moxiu thought that Little Fu Shun was very comfortable, so he reached out his other hand to pat Little Fu Shun’s head.
“Don’t say, she’s really quite obedient…Little Fushun! You pooped again!”
Outside the villa, Mr. Tang stood at the door and looked inside.
“MO Xiu, oh MO Xiu, I don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse for you to be my disciple. However, since you have the ability, you must bear the responsibility that you deserve.”
Mr. Tang turned around and walked away.
In the villa, MO Xiu washed his hands a few times before he realized that there was no smell. Little Fushun was on his hands again.
At this moment. Little Fu Shun was beside MO Xiu’s feet. looking at him pitifully and innocently.
MO Xiu was furious.
“Don’t act cute and pull on me again, I’ll beat you up!”
Little Fushun seemed to understand her words. He took two steps back and sat on the ground. His eyes blinked and tears actually flowed out.
MO Xiu felt a headache coming on. This was simply a little vixen.
“Alright, stop crying. I won’t hit you, but you have to be good!’”‘
MO Xiu didn’t know if it was his imagination, but he actually saw Little Fu Shun nod slightly.
MO Xiu found it a little funny. He knew quite a bit about such a small thing. Was Little Fushun’s brain as big as a thumb?
MO Xiu patted Little Fu Shun’s head and said,””Little Fushun, you’re so cute. You almost cried just now. You don’t look like a boy at all.”
Little Fu Shun raised his two front paws and slammed them down. He opened his mouth and revealed his teeth.
Moxiu was stunned for a moment before he reacted. This was a show of authority towards him.
“Hahaha, you’re not fierce at all.” MO Xiu laughed loudly.” MO Xiu used his hand to lightly hit Little Fu Shun’s head.
Little Fu Shun seemed a little angry as he bit Moxiu’s finger.
He narrowed his eyes and pressed his nose as if he was exerting all his strength, but he didn’t feel any pain at all.
Xiaofu exerted some strength and pulled it out again.
It seemed that Little Fushun was also confused. He could even shit himself if he bit someone.
Moxiu had no choice but to clean up the ground.
“Little Fushun, you should be a wild beast, right? Wild beasts all have innate skills. What is your skill? Don’t tell me it’s just pooping?”
These words seemed to have angered Little Fu Shun. He pounced on MO Xiu’s foot and bit him hard.
MO Xiu pinched Little Fu Shun’s back and lifted him up, saying, “”Little thing, you have quite a character. It’s getting late. Eat something and sleep!”
MO Xiu didn’t know what Little Fushun could eat. He figured that he couldn’t eat meat at such a young age, so he passed some vegetables from the villa to Little Fushun.
Little Fushun looked at the vegetables and sniffed them before walking away in disgust.
“Yo! You’re quite bold. Let’s go! If you don ‘t eat, then sleep.”
MO Xiu wanted to give Fu Shun a room to himself, but Fu Shun refused to leave Mo Xiu.
MO Xiu had no choice but to bring him to his bedroom. Little Fu Shun ‘consciously’ laid on MO Xiu’s stomach and fell asleep in no time.
MO Xiu patted Little Fortune awake.” You can sleep here, but if you want to poop, you can poop anywhere.. If you poop on the bed, I’ll definitely hit you!””

                    



Chapter 75: Beast (1)

Early in the morning, a ray of sunlight shone on Moxiu’s face.
She opened her eyes and looked at the scenery outside the window. She didn’t want to get up. This place was really comfortable. Whether it was the temperature, humidity, or the environment, it was all calming.
Moxiu didn’t understand. This was the eighteenth floor of the Cloud Top Villa Complex, which was also the peak of the mountain.
How could there be such a comfortable climate at the top of the mountain?
He looked at the time. It was seven o’clock!
It was time to pack up and go out. There was still in-faculty training today.
She sat up and realized a problem. Where was Little Fushun? Didn’t she sleep on her stomach last night?
If it wasn’t on the bed, could it be on the floor…
When Moxiu saw the scene on the ground, he was stunned. The ground was covered in Little Fushun’s feces.
MO Xiu was about to flare up when he remembered what he said last night. Little Fu Shun did not poop on the bed, but on the floor.
“Sigh, you’re awesome!”
MO Xiu immediately got out of bed to clean up Little Fushun’s feces. Today’s feces were a little better than yesterday’s. He didn’t have diarrhea, and there was no smell.
“Little Fushun, you haven’t eaten anything. How can you poop so much? Could your innate skill really be sh * t?”
Little Fushun didn’t get angry this time. He lowered his head in embarrassment, perhaps feeling that he had gone overboard.
“Looks like I was right!”
Little Fu Shun couldn’t bear the humiliation and bared his fangs at MO Xiu.
“Save it, take your teeth back!”
Little Fu Shun seemed to understand. He retracted his teeth and turned his head to the side, not looking at MO Xiu.
MO Xiu was about to persuade her when the doorbell rang.
After locking Little Fushun in the bedroom, she went downstairs.
Little Fu Shun was a wild beast. If others knew that MO Xiu had tamed wild beasts, it would be a serious matter. If it was light, they would kill Little Fu Shun, and if it was serious, even MO Xiu would be captured.
No one else could be blamed for this. The wild beasts had caused too much harm to humans. In addition to the spies that had been lurking among the humans, no wild beasts were allowed to appear within the territory of the Alliance.
This was the reason why Mr. Tang said that if he wanted to live in this villa, he had to be a trustworthy person.
According to Moxiu’s current understanding, Elder Tang’s status in the Human
Alliance wasn’t low. This was even stranger.
Mr. Tang had participated in the war and witnessed the harm that wild beasts could do to humans. Why would he send Little Fushun to him now?
MO Xiu couldn’t understand or figure it out.
As he was deep in thought, Moxiu had already reached the door. When he opened the door, he saw an unfamiliar woman in her thirties. She was dressed exquisitely.
“Hello, are you MO Xiu, Mr. MO?”
“Yes, what’s the matter?”
The woman bowed and said, ” I’m sorry to disturb you. I’m the butler of the 18th floor of the Cloud Top Villa. My name is Fang Yun. Can I disturb you for a few minutes? Can I ask you something?
MO Xiu looked at the time. There was still time.
“Go ahead.”
“May I ask how many people are staying here?”
“There’s only one person at the moment. I’m not sure if there will be others moving in in the future.”
Fang Yun quickly recorded it on his phone and said, “Alright, do you have any requirements for the staff in the villa?”
“An employee? What employee?”
“I’m sorry for being abrupt. The Cloud Top Villa will help the owner recruit staff, such as nannies, chefs, and cleaners.”
Moxiu nodded.” Oh, I don’t need any employees in my villa.
“Don’t you need chefs and cleaners too?”
MO Xiu thought about Little Fushun, and he couldn’t afford to make any mistakes. He nodded again.
“Alright then, Mr. Mo. Do we have any part-time service? It was to send someone to clean the villa or prepare meals at the designated time.” Mon thought for a moment. This was feasible.
“Are the people you hired safe? You won’t steal anything, right?”
‘ Don’t worry, Mr. Mo. The staff is absolutely safe and they all have cleaning skills. They are very efficient. Your house will probably be cleaned in less than half an hour. During this period, there will be a supervisor or above supervising it. Please don’t worry about the safety.”
Moxiu nodded.” Alright, I only need cleaning services. The time will be set at 7:20 a. m. every day, which is five minutes later. Starting today.
“Alright! I’ll arrange it now!”
“There’s one condition that you must remember!”
“Please speak!”
“The fifth room on the second floor is my bedroom. I don’t like people approaching my room.”
“No problem. We will remember all the customer’s requests!” Fang Yun nodded heavily.”
Fang Yun then asked a few more questions. MO Xiu sighed. Was this the life of a rich person? Everything was custom-made.
MO Xiu saw that the cleaning time was almost up and immediately interrupted Fang Yun.
“Alright, I don’t need the rest of the service. I just want a cleaning service.”
Moxiu didn’t even want to clean the place, but how was he supposed to clean such a big villa?
After sending Fang Yun off, MO Xiu jogged back to his room.
As soon as he entered the house, Little Fortune meowed. He shouted.
“Looks like you really are a cat. The book says that only cats meow.”
Little Fu Shun bared his teeth in anger. MO Xiu pointed his finger and immediately became obedient and sensible.
Someone will enter the villa later and hear the commotion,” MO Xiu said.” You can’t make a sound. They’ll leave soon, understand?
Xiaofu’s ears twitched as he listened to the commotion outside the door.
Perhaps it was because he saw MO Xiu’s serious expression, Little Fu Shun actually nodded adorably.
“Haha, alright, I’ll test you later.”
The cleaning staff arrived very quickly, and Little Fushun did not make any noise as promised.
At this moment, Liu Ziyang called MO Xiu.
“Boss, what are you doing? Come down, let’s go to school together. I still have to participate in the department selection today.”
“Oh, I’m supervising the cleaners to clean the villa. Give me five minutes. I’ll go down now.”
“D * mn, boss, aren’t you too free? Do I need you to supervise me?
“Alright, I’ll go down now!”
MO Xiu hung up the phone and took out some vegetables from the fridge, as well as a large basin.
When she returned to her room, she said to Little Fushun,” Little Fushun, I know you don’t like to eat vegetables. There’s nothing else for now. Just deal with it first. I’ll bring you some meat to eat when I come back tonight!
Little Fushun’s eyes lit up when he heard that. MO Xiu was a little curious. How could such a big piece of meat move?
MO Xiu hurriedly changed his clothes and prepared to leave. Before he left, he said,”lf you want to poop, poop in the basin. If you’re obedient, you’ll have meat to eat!”
After leaving the house, MO Xiu went to find Liu Ziyang. It was getting late. If it wasn’t for Qiang Zi sending him off, he might have been late.
Qiang Zi t s driving skills were still amazing. He arrived at Yanjing University in less than ten minutes.
MO Xiu hurriedly arrived at the No. 3 training ground. At this moment, everyone else had already arrived.
Mu Mu saw MO Xiu enter and said to everyone, ‘”‘ Alright, now that everyone is in the middle of the crowd, let’s begin the morning’s actual combat training. Today’s one-on-one training, and the name list for the match is MO Xiu…”
At this moment, MO Xiu had already arrived in the group. Dong Fang chuckled and whispered, “MO Xiu, you’re really awesome. You’re almost late after moving out. Are you immersed in your gentle home”‘
MO Xiu glanced at him and said, “I think you haven’t been beaten enough!
Dong Fang was so frightened that he immediately shut his mouth. This MO Xiu dared to do it but did not dare to admit it.
Yang Qingzhuo was a little unhappy when he heard their conversation. He had not seen MO Xiu since yesterday afternoon..

                    



Chapter 76: Chapter 79 -Eye Cleansing!_l

After Mu Mu distributed the battle list, they started to fight group by group.
Moxiu was up against a member of Team Blue Desolate. His skill was to increase his instantaneous attack power.
Without expending much strength, Moxiu defeated him. He didn’t even use any skills, using the flexibility of his moves to defeat him.
The most tiring person in the morning’s competition was not the ten members who had advanced, but Mu Mu, who was watching from the side.
Mu Mu would take down a lot of notes for every battle.
The morning competition ended, and the afternoon was the special training that Mu Mu had mentioned.
Moxiu originally thought that the special training was a basic training for physical fitness and speed and strength.
However, they did not expect Mu Mu to customize a set of training methods for everyone based on the battles over the past two days.
When Mu Mu told them the training plan, everyone was shocked.
” Dong Fang will focus on training explosive power and speed. He Lingyue will improve her physical fitness and flexibility. Yang Qingzhuo will need to improve her explosive attack. Hu Xianming will focus on improving his physical fitness and overall awareness. The goal is to take care of all his teammates. Xiao Lan will train her willpower… Finally, MO Xiu, you…Just practice.”
Originally, Mu Mu had wanted to let Moxiu increase his stamina because Moxiu was the strongest. It was very likely that he would fight until the end and engage in a prolonged battle. However, after thinking about it, he decided against it. Moxiu’s stamina was already very terrifying.
Mu Mu not only pointed out the parts that needed to be strengthened, but also designed a unique training method for each person according to the situation.
For example, Hu Xianming had only released Holy Light on himself in the previous duels, so her observation of the situation was not very strong.
The training plan Mu Mu designed for Hu Xianming was to give her a few targets. In the beginning, Mu Mu would shout loudly for her to apply Holy
Light to which target, and then slowly let her judge which target needed Holy Light.
The training method of Cleansing Eyes, which accurately found everyone’s weaknesses and strengthened them, was very targeted, and everyone improved very quickly.
If the respect they had shown Mu Mu before was due to their respect for her, now everyone sincerely felt that Mu Mu was very powerful and acknowledged her position as an instructor.
During the afternoon’s high-intensity training, Cao Fenglin unexpectedly came to visit. He brought some energy replenishing food and drinks.
However, Cao Fenglin’s purpose for visiting was not pure. After he came, he didn’t care about the training and directly pulled Mu Mu to the side to chat.
Mu Mu wanted to take a look at everyone’s training but was stopped by Cao Fenglin.
It was a euphemistic way of saying, “Leave the method to them. As a teacher, you have to give them space.”
Cao Fenglin and Mu Mu were extremely close. Even the blind Dong Fang could tell that the relationship between the two was not normal.
Previously, Cao Fenglin had a dispirited look on his face. Although the various competition methods he had designed were very good, he was still lazy.
His unshaven appearance made Moxiu think that he was in his thirties or forties.
But now, he had sorted out his image. He was clearly a young man with aspirations in his late twenties.
MO Xiu couldn’t help but sigh. Cao Fenglin was able to teach at Yanjing University at such a young age, and he even led a team. It seemed like the school had taken a liking to him. He was definitely a famous figure in the past.
Cao Fenglin didn’t stay for long before he was chased away by Mu Mu.
In the afternoon, the ten contestants who had advanced were very fulfilling, including MO Xiu.
Mu Mu still customized a training plan for MO Xiu. Not only could he not relax at the strongest point, but he also had to be the strictest.
This training method was very simple. It was the training method used by the university to improve the foundation, but the intensity was ten times stronger.
Even Moxiu was sweating profusely under such intense training.
After training, they took a shower in the bathroom.
Moxiu’s mind was focused on Little Fushun and the Imperial Family, so he was a little distracted when he showered and was a little slow.
When he came out, he found Yang Qingzhuo, He Lingyue, Dong Fang, and Mu Mu waiting for him.
“I’m sorry to keep you waiting,” said Moxiu.”Why didn’t you leave first?”
MO Xiu didn’t mean to chase them away. He just felt that since he had moved out, these people could go back to their dorms first.
“It’s time for the four of us from Class Six to get together and have a meal together,” Mu Mu said cheerfully.”
She then looked at Yang Qingzhuo and snickered. And your little follower!”
The few of them were very familiar with each other, so it was relatively more casual to have a meal tozether. Thev went straizht to the cafeteria to eat.
Everyone used MO Xiu’s move as an excuse to extort him for a meal.
Moxiu didn’t mind. He felt that his life was very good now. He had a fulfilling goal and many friends. It was completely different from the closed-door training in high school.
During the meal, the few of them chatted. Everyone wanted to ask Mu Mu and Cao Fenglin what was going on, but they felt that it wasn’t a good idea.
In the end, He Lingyue, who had the best relationship with Mu Mu, couldn’t help but stare.
“Mumu, you and Cao laoshi…”
Mu Mu blushed when he heard this. He didn’t need to answer, everyone already knew the answer.
Seeing everyone’s ‘understanding’ eyes, Mu Mu opened his mouth and closed it again, but he didn’t say anything.
Mumu, who had always been straightforward and capable, was actually hesitating.
Finally, he sighed and said,”Sigh! Let me tell you, Cao Fenglin and I…They’re boyfriend and girlfriend.”
Dong Fang slammed the table and stood up. Just as he was about to shout, he suddenly remembered what had happened last time and quietly sat down to ask.
“Mu Mu, love between teacher and student! How exciting!”
Mu Mu was so shocked that he was covered in sweat. If Dong Fang had shouted it out just now, tomorrow, Mu Mu would be excited!’The picture of the girl would probably spread throughout the school.
MO Xiu punched Dong Fang’s head and said, ‘”‘This is a university. It’s very normal. If you want to be capable, you can marry a beautiful university teacher.”
Dong Fang was originally unhappy after being slapped, but when he heard MO Xiu’s words, he immediately beamed with joy at Mu Mu.
” Mumu, I’ve always treated you as an elder sister. Teacher Cao Fenglin is my brother-in-law. Can you ask him to help me see if there are any suitable female teachers?”
Mu Mu smiled awkwardly. MO Xiu punched Dong Fang’s head again.
Dong Fang looked at him with a puzzled expression. I asked for your idea, and you hit me!
“Mumu, tell me, how did Mr. Cao chase you?” He Lingyue asked.”
Mu Mu’s face turned even redder when he heard this. He almost buried his head under the table and said in an inaudible voice,””l chased him!”
Yang Qingzhuo, who had been silent all this while, suddenly became spirited and his eyes widened.
“Instructor Mu Mu, how did you do it? Can you…”
As he spoke, he glanced at MO Xiu from the corner of his eyes.
Everyone understood what Yang Qingzhuo meant.
Mu Mu began to talk about her experience of a woman chasing a man.
“Cao Fenglin looks very casual and lazy on the surface, but he’s actually very gentle. Actually, there’s one thing that I lied to you about. After the class competition, I’ve been in contact with him. My skill is very special, and my actual combat ability isn’t very strong. That’s why I came to find Cao Fenglin to ask him how to improve my results.”
MO Xiu interrupted with a smile, “You’re giving me special treatment!
Mu Mu knew that MO Xiu was joking. He smiled in response and opened his heart completely. He was no longer as reserved as before.
“Every time I look for him, he would gently and carefully answer the questions in my heart. His laziness is that he has lost hope, but he still retained the warmth of the past.”
“I’m very curious. How did such a man become like this? After asking about him, I realized…. I like him!”

                    



Chapter 77: Smelling Hot Weapons Again

Just as MO Xiu and the others were holding their breaths and focusing their attention, wanting to hear about Cao Fenglin’s past, Mu Mu paused for a moment as a look of difficulty appeared on his face.
Moxiu’s sharp senses caught this point and asked,””What’s wrong? If it’s not convenient to say it, then don’t say it.”
Mu Mu shook his head and said,” Actually, it’s nothing. You just need to ask about these things. It’s easy to find out. It’s not a secret. Many people know about it.
“It’s like this. Cao Fenglin had a girlfriend before. The two of them were once the golden boy and jade girl of Yanjing University. After graduation, they stayed in school and became teachers. At that time, Cao Fenglin was bright, capable, and positive.”
“Everything started from 1966. Their happy times didn’t last long. One night six years ago, Cao Fenglin couldn’t find his girlfriend. It wasn’t until the next morning that he found her corpse behind the teaching building. ”
MO Xiu narrowed his eyes. Killing a teacher in Yanjing University? This matter did not cause a sensation, but only spread in a small area.
It seemed like it was because of this matter that Cao Fenglin was dispirited until now.
“Cao Fenglin’s girlfriend was an assault-type teacher at that time. Her combat ability was incredible, but she was assassinated. There was a wound on her forehead that went through her entire head. There were no other wounds, and there were no signs of battle.”
Moxiu’s eyes, which were originally slightly narrowed, suddenly widened. This was…Hot weapons!
“Didn’t Teacher Cao investigate back then?” MO Xiu asked.”
Mu Mu nodded and said,” Yes, I did. I asked Cao Fenglin, but he and I were unwilling to talk about that matter. I only heard a few words from him. He investigated for three years, day and night, but in the end, he gave up.”
MO Xiu was certain that Cao Fenglin must have discovered something during his investigation. Otherwise, why would he give up so easily? It seemed like he had to have a chat with Cao Fenglin when he had the time. There was finally some progress in the firearms mission.
“Is that why you like him?” He Lingyue asked, clutching her chin.”
Mu Mu nodded seriously and said,” Yes. At first, I just felt sorry for him. Later, I realized that I liked him.
Mu Mu no longer blushed. He straightened his body and joked,””After that, I launched a fierce attack on him, but he was always indifferent.”
“Until the day you were eliminated from the selection competition.”
Mu Mu pointed at MO Xiu and said,” That’s right. I was very sad that day. I tried so hard but it didn’t change the outcome. He came to comfort me. He let go of his laziness and took out warmth.
He Lingyue patted her eyes and said,” Aiya, it’s so mushy. But congratulations, Ms. Cao is very good.
Mu Mu nodded and said, “Yeah, I think so too.
On the other hand, Yang Qingzhuo, who had always been in high spirits, was a little depressed.
“Sister Mumu, you’ve said so much, but you didn’t say how you were going to chase her?”
“Hahaha…”
Everyone laughed.
After the meal, MO Xiu walked to the school gate alone. Qiang Zi had been waiting there for a long time.
He opened the car door. Before MO Xiu could get in, a black shadow entered the car.
MO Xiu didn’t even need to look to know that it was Yang Qingzhuo.
“Get out of the car. I want to go home!”
“I’m going home too!”
“Where is your home? Let Qiang Zi send you back!”
“Where your home is, my home is!”
“Stop fooling around. Go back to the dormitory quickly. See you tomorrow!”
“I’ve already contacted the school yesterday. I’ve checked out of the dormitory and can’t go back. I’ve put my luggage in the trunk.”
MO Xiu glanced at Qiang Zi. The luggage must have been placed in advance, which meant that Yang Qingzhuo had contacted Qiang Zi in advance.
Qiang Zi turned the scope to the side so that MO Xiu couldn’t see him. Then, he leaned against the steering wheel and pretended to sleep.
“Can I trust you?” MO Xiu asked Yang Qingzhuo.”
“Of course!” Yang Qingzhuo pouted. If you don’t believe me, who else can you believe?”
“Can I trust you?”
“I already said that I can! Definitely! You have to believe me!
This time, Yang Qingzhuo didn’t answer easily. Looking at MO Xiu’s serious expression, he could guess that MO Xiu had a secret.
Yang Qingzhuo clenched his fists tightly. So what if he couldn’t let anyone know about his secret? Even if you were a beast, I would still follow you.
Then, he nodded heavily and said,”Yes!
There was only the word ” Yi ” in the last sentence, but MO Xiu was the most reassured. Although Yang Qingzhuo was a little strange, he was not stupid. MO Xiu was willing to believe her.
MO Xiu didn’t say anything else. He went straight into the car and closed the door.
“Qiang Zi, stop pretending to be asleep. Let’s go!
Qiang Zi sat up and stepped on the accelerator. He flew away.
When they passed by a fresh food supermarket, MO Xiu asked Qiang Zi to stop and promised Little Fushun to buy some meat.
MO Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo walked into the supermarket. Yang Qingzhuo said excitedly,”Mo Xiu, can I take whatever I want?”
MO Xiu’s entire body trembled. How could he have forgotten about this God of Food? He had eaten so little in the canteen just now. He would definitely eat a lot when he returned home.
“Of course, you can pay the bill!” Moxiu nodded.”
Yang Qingzhuo’s face immediately changed into a bitter one. He said with grievance, “Then I won’t eat!”
MO Xiu looked left and right. There were still quite a lot of people here, so he didn’t want to argue with her.
In order to avoid trouble, Moxiu compromised.
“Alright, take whatever you want, but not too casually. I’m not very rich!” Yang Qingzhuo smiled cutely and skipped off to shop.
Half an hour later, MO Xiu regretted bringing Yang Qingzhuo along. He had bought too much meat. The bill was fifteen thousand!
MO Xiu had never thought that he would spend 15,000 yuan on groceries.
Looking at the excited Yang Qingzhuo, MO Xiu felt helpless.
Qiang Zi drove very fast and returned to the Yunding Villa Complex in a few minutes.
Yang Qingzhuo was a little stunned after getting out of the car. He looked at MO Xiu and said,”Mo Xiu, you live here?”
“Yes, I live here.” Moxiu nodded.”
“You’re already living here, but you still won’t let me eat meat.”
MO Xiu thought that Yang Qingzhuo was serious for once. He didn’t expect him to be waiting for him here.
“If I didn’t allow it, would you have bought it?”
At the mention of this, Yang Qingzhuo looked at the two big bags of meat in his hands and laughed.
MO Xiu brought Yang Qingzhuo to the eighteenth floor in the elevator. They stopped in front of the villa.
“Why aren’t you leaving?” Yang Qingzhuo asked.”
After saying that, he lowered his head to look at the meat, meaning to quickly go in and eat it!
“What does your family do?” Moxiu asked in an extremely serious tone.” Yang Qingzhuo tilted his head in confusion.
“I need to understand you. Otherwise, I can’t trust you completely!”
MO Xiu thought about it and still felt that he should be more cautious.
Yang Qingzhuo replied seriously, “Are we exchanging information?”
“Who taught you that?” MO Xiu laughed.”
“My father!”
“Who is your father?”
“My father is the General Staff Officer of the Yanjing Division of the allied forces!”
MO Xiu was shocked. This was a big shot.
“Didn’t your father ask you to keep it a secret?”
“We are exchanging information!”
“Interesting. I’ll bring you in, but no matter what you see, even if you decide not to interact with me in the future, don’t tell anyone, okay? I believe in your character.”
“Even if you’re a beast, I’ll still keep in touch with you,” said Yang Qingzhuo.” MO Xiu laughed as he led Yang Qingzhuo into the villa and into his room.
When he opened the door and saw the leisurely Little Fushun, Yang Qingzhuo widened his eyes and looked at MO Xiu in disbelief.
“Are you really a beast? Is this your child?”

                    



Chapter 78: Gunshots (1)

“Are you really a beast? Is this your child?”
“I’m not a wild beast, and Little Fushun isn’t my child.
Yang Qingzhuo looked at Little Fushun closely and said,””Then who is this little
“I adopted her!”
Yang Qingzhuo looked at Little Fushun seriously again, then at MO Xiu and said,”Oh, I see. What’s its name?”
“Little Fushun!”
“Hahaha, he’s actually called Little Fushun?”
Perhaps it was because of Yang Qingzhuo’s mockery, Little Fushun was displeased.
Xiaofu sniffed and suddenly became excited. He rushed to Yang Qingzhuo.
It turned out that he was eyeing the meat in Yang Qingzhuo’s hand!
Little Fushun bit down on the plastic bag and refused to let go. MO Xiu held him in his arms.
“Little thing, you can’t eat it raw now. You can eat it when it’s cooked!”
Little Fushun’s small head was filled with confusion. Why couldn’t they eat raw?
MO Xiu took the meat from Yang Qingzhuo’s hands and prepared to go downstairs.
Yang Qingzhuo immediately picked up Little Fushun and said, “Little thing, you’re quite cute!”
Little Fushun was not so easy to talk to. He looked at Yang Qingzhuo with disdain. After struggling to no avail, he turned his head away from Yang Qingzhuo.
MO Xiu saw that Yang Qingzhuo had adapted so quickly, so he was relieved. He
took two big bags of meat and went downstairs.
After putting the meat into the kitchen, Moxiu was put in a difficult position. He didn’t know how to cook at all.
Looking upstairs, Yang Qingzhuo was even more hopeless. After thinking about it, he could only make the simplest dish. Hotpot?
The next step was to cut the meat. MO Xiu had only eaten one hotpot before. The last time he saw the meat, it was cut into pieces.
Moxiu had never cut meat before, so he didn’t know how to use a kitchen knife. However, he quickly got used to it.
MO Xiu’s hands were very steady. He sliced the meat easily, and the meat slices were thin and even.
After that, he prepared the pot and cutlery. The whole process took less than half an hour.
“Yang Qingzhuo! Little Fushun! I’m going downstairs to eat meat!”
When Yang Qingzhuo heard that there was meat to eat, he immediately ran down with Little Fushun in his arms.
“I won’t cook anything else. I’ll just eat hotpot!” said MO Xiu.”
Yang Qing said nonchalantly, “It’s alright, as long as there’s meat. I’m not picky.
Little Fushun looked at Yang Qingzhuo and nodded in agreement.
MO Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo sat down. Little Fushun imitated the two of them and sat down beside the plate on the table.
Yang Qingzhuo began to display his talent again. Just like last time, he boiled the meat and divided the meat in one go!
Half of the meat had been eaten, which was a few thousand yuan. MO Xiu’s heart ached, but he still ate a lot.
Yang Qingzhuo played normally, showing his true nature as a glutton. Little Fushun also ate with relish. MO Xiu picked some tender meat for him.
Perhaps it was because he had never eaten cooked meat before, but the more he ate, the more excited Little Fushun became.
The next few days were very peaceful, and Little Fushun slowly accepted Yang Qingzhuo.
MO Xiu went to the training grounds during the day, and Mu Mu trained everyone, so he had some experience.
It had to be said that Cao Fenglin didn’t say that Mu Mu was talented in coaching because he wanted to pick up girls.
Mumu had been digging deeper into everyone these days, and the training plan had become more and more perfect and scientific.
The feeling he gave off was that he had completely forgotten that Mu Mu and the others were in the same batch of students. It was as if he was a teacher.
July 28th, two days before the competition.
Cao Fenglin’s selection of substitutes had also ended. He brought the six substitutes to the stadium where MO Xiu and the others were.
Mu Mu and Cao Fenglin placed everyone aside and started discussing in a corner. They were quite emotional.
After that, Mu Mu walked to the center of the stadium and and I have discussed it and decided to regroup!”
Moxiu frowned and looked at the people around him. He did regroup. These teammates were all chosen by him and had a chemistry after training these days.
Cao Fenglin seemed to have noticed MO Xiu’s unwillingness and immediately said,””Don’t worry, it’s a good thing that we’ve been regrouped. In the past, the strength of the two teams of our support system was very average. This is to show more of each person’s skills and characteristics, so as to increase the chances of being selected into the school team.”
“But the other divisions are different. The other four divisions all have a chance to compete for the championship, so they will be divided into two teams. The eight people in the first team are the strongest eight people, and their goal is to obtain a ranking. The second team is obviously much weaker, and their goal is to gain experience.”
“You should understand now, right?”
“You want us to regroup and form a team that can fight for the rankings?” asked Moxiu.”
Cao Fenglin nodded.” That’s right. In the past, the support-type was the weakest. As for the reason…” You all understand, but this time it’s different. We have MO Xiu, Xiao Lan, and a group of extremely outstanding assistants. I think we still have some competitive edge.”
Yang Qingzhuo was a little unhappy, afraid that Cao Fenglin would separate him from MO Xiu.
“Teacher Cao, how are the teams divided?”
Cao Fenglin pointed at Mumu and said,” Mumu understands you guys better than I do. She will decide the candidates.
No matter how powerful Mu Mu was, she was still a student after all. She seemed hesitant. Everyone had a good relationship, and she didn’t want to offend anyone.
After taking two deep breaths, Mu Mu’s eyes became firm. He couldn’t let his personal emotions affect the overall situation. As an excellent coach, this was a necessary step.
” The first team members are MO Xiu, Xiao Lan, Hu Xianming, Yang Qingzhuo, He Lingyue…”
Mu Mu finished the grouping in one breath. Team MO Xiu didn’t make any changes. Xiao Lan entered the first team and Dong Fang became a substitute.
It was obvious that Mu Mu had considered a lot. In terms of strength and teamwork, Xiao Lan was a strong point of attack. She could be plugged in and used. Her defense was very strong, and she could also replace Dong Fang’s meat shield.
This way, MO Xiu and Xiao Lan could become the core, and their tactics would become more diverse.
After Mu Mu finished speaking, Cao Fenglin added,””The first and second teams have already been divided. Does anyone have any objections? If not, then it’s settled.”
The original members of Xiao Lan’s team were a little unwilling, but looking at the current members of Team One, there was nothing they could do. They were indeed stronger than them.
“Alright!” Cao Fenglin continued. If there are no objections, then it’s settled.
You guys continue to train. I won’t disturb you anymore!”
After saying that, Cao Fenglin directly left, leaving the scene to Mu Mu.
Mu Mu clapped his hands and said,” Alright, everyone, cheer up. The competition is in two days. Next, we will have a team battle. Team one against team two. The restriction is that team one cannot use skills.”
At night, MO Xiu returned to the villa. He felt that it was not appropriate for him and Yang Qingzhuo to be alone in the villa.
However, there was almost no one he could completely trust. He couldn’t let anyone see Little Fushun at this time.
In the end, Moxiu thought of someone, someone he could completely trust… Zheng Yi!
MO Xiu slammed the table and said,”That’s right, how could I forget about him!
After making a phone call, she was ready to go out.
Yang Qingzhuo and Little Fushun looked at MO Xiu in shock.
“MO Xiu, where are you going?”
“Pick up a person!”
After MO Xiu left the house, he went to find Qiang Zi and went to pick Zheng Yi up with him.
After arriving at Qingyun University, MO Xiu felt that something was amiss. Why were there so few people on campus?
Zheng Yi was already waiting with his luggage because he had called earlier.
“Zheng Yi, why are there so few people in your school?”
“Oh, someone died in our school last night. A girl’s temple was pierced through!”
MO Xiu narrowed his eyes and told Qiang Zi not to leave.
“Shot?”

                    



Chapter 80: People Always Have to Look Forward

Cao Fenglin looked at the gun and asked,”How did you get this gun?
I bought this gun from the black market,” Moxiu said.” I’m currently investigating firearms. I hope Teacher can help me.
Moxiu took out the Dark Shadow’s medal and revealed his identity. This way, Cao Fenglin wouldn’t think that he was a criminal criminal.
Cao Fenglin regained his lazy appearance and said,””How can I help you?”
“You’ve been investigating firearms for five years. You must have found something. I originally thought that the situation wouldn’t develop too quickly, but I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly.”
“Are you talking about the incident at Qingyun University?”
“Yes, sir! You know?”
“It was indeed a shooting case, but we couldn’t find anything.”
“Teacher Cao, I don’t mean to offend you, but don’t you think this case is very similar to what you experienced back then?” MO Xiu frowned and said.”
Cao Fenglin laughed coldly.”
“The time, place, modus operandi, and the choice of victims are all consistent.”
“Even if you are a pervert, would you do such a similar case again after six years?”
“I don’t understand what you mean.” Moxiu shook his head.”
“If you don’t understand, then don’t continue investigating. This is a thankless task. Why don’t you focus on improving yourself? Your future is limitless. Don’t waste time like me.”
“Teacher, I can stay out of this, but what about my relatives and friends?” MO Xiu stood up and said. I don’t want anyone I know to die from a surprise attack. ”
Cao Fenglin waved his hand, indicating for MO Xiu to sit down.
“Sit down first. Don’t be agitated. I’ve paid attention to this incident and investigated it, including all the information about Zhang Nana and Yang Qingfeng. This incident has no reference value.”
It turned out that Cao Fenglin had investigated the matter before MO Xiu. No wonder Yang Qingfeng had asked the same question.
MO Xiu looked at Cao Fenglin unwillingly and said,””Have you forgotten the pain? How could he be so calm?”
Cao Fenglin couldn’t do anything to MO Xiu. He sighed and said,””Sigh! I can answer your question just now. Why is this case the same as the one from six years ago?”
“Why?”
“The two incidents look similar, but they are different in essence. Yang Qingfeng’s current height can’t be compared to mine six years ago. The expression of the deceased before he died is also different. Six years ago, he was ambushed, but this time, the deceased’s expression before he died was very angry, but there were no signs of a fight.”
MO Xiu still didn’t understand what Cao Fenglin meant. What did this mean?
Cao Fenglin spoke slowly.” MO Xiu, I’ll advise you one more time. Don’t investigate firearms. There won’t be any results.
“Please answer!” said Moxiu.
“Sigh, if there’s any connection between the two, it must be that the latter imitates the former. Have you heard of copycat crimes?”
Moxiu had never come into contact with such knowledge before, so he shook his head.
“A copycat crime is when there are two murderers. The former uses the same method to commit the crime, while the latter imitates the former’s method to commit the crime. Generally, there are two motives for doing this. One is the latter’s blind worship of the former, and the other is…”
‘ What?” Moxiu raised his head abruptly and spoke first,” The other is to cover up their crimes and shift their attention to the former to achieve their own goals.
Cao Fenglin nodded his head in admiration and said, “”That’s right, this incident is very likely to be like this.”
“Then who do you think is the most likely murderer?”
Cao Fenglin had a smile on his face, revealing a rare confidence.””There’s no need for that. The murderer is Yang Qingfeng. You have a motive but no evidence. You can investigate, but you won’t find any valuable clues in the end.”
“Yang Qingfeng? This person is indeed a little strange.”
“There’s no need to doubt him. If you want to investigate him, just investigate him.”
“Teacher Cao, may I ask how you obtained this information…
Cao Fenglin took out his phone, casually tapped on it, and pushed it in front of Mo Xiu.
The familiar interface on the phone was obviously Shadow’s software. Looking at the level, it was LV6.
Oh my god, MO Xiu had completed so many missions, and there were even two B -rank missions that had just reached LV2. One could imagine how many missions Cao Fenglin had completed or what high-level missions he had completed.
Moxiu felt a little awkward. He had just shown the Dark Shadow Medal to Cao Fenglin. Now, it seemed like he was just showing off his skills in front of an expert.
“Teacher Cat), are you really not going to help me investigate?”
Cao Fenglin looked at the entrance as though he was looking at Mu Mu.
“Human! He couldn’t just live in the past. When it was time to look forward, he had to look forward. Otherwise, he would miss out on even more.”
MO Xiu could understand Cao Fenglin’s feelings. He had painstakingly investigated for three years and had been dispirited for three years. It wasn’t easy for him to finally have hope like Mu Mu. He didn’t want to return to the past.
“Then can you tell me the results of your investigation?” “There was no result. In the end, all the clues were lost.” “You gave up just because the clue was broken?”
“Yes!”
“I don’t believe it!”
“Brat, believe it or not, you can leave now!”
MO Xiu was mercilessly chased out of the door. Cao Fenglin must be hiding something, but it seemed like he wouldn’t be able to get anything out of him.
This time, it was an unfamiliar girl who was killed. The next time, it might be someone he knew. Thinking of this, Moxiu still felt that he could not relax and decided to continue investigating.
MO Xiu contacted Zheng Yi and asked him to keep an eye on Yang Qingfeng and report to him as soon as he saw anything.
In the afternoon, he continued his targeted training as usual. Thanks to this period of training, the effects of the Spirit Gathering Grass were fully unleashed. MO Xiu’s various basic abilities were approaching their limits.
Motheo’s strength was 701.243kg, and his speed was 4.012 seconds per 100 meters.
The current Motheo did not activate the basic stats of the War God’s Descent. He had basically reached the stats of the skill he had just awakened.
In other words, Moxiu’s physical strength had increased by 100%. The current Moxiu could definitely be considered a superman.
This was not the limit of humans. As long as there were sufficient resources, even without skills, they could still create a terrifying warrior.
A thought flashed through MO Xiu’s mind. The descendants of the imperial family had unlimited resources. How strong would their physical bodies be? Was it even stronger than when he used the Descent of the War God?
After the training, MO Xiu looked at his phone and saw three missed calls from Zheng Yi. Did Yang Qingfeng make a move so soon?
Zheng Yi called MO Xiu back and gave him a piece of news that was neither good nor bad.
The bad thing was that Yang Qingfeng had disappeared, and the clues were completely cut off. It would be very difficult to continue the investigation.
Fortunately, according to Zheng Yi’s investigation, Yang Qingfeng was taken away by three teachers of Qingyun University. The school must have found out something and took him away.
Thinking about it, it made sense. If Cao Fenglin and MO Xiu could think of it, how could such a big school not think of it?
Now, it was difficult to continue investigating or to know the follow-up.
Qingyun University would definitely keep it a secret and not spread it.
MO Xiu instructed Zheng Yi to follow up and see if he could find anything from the school’s actions.
On August 1st, the school’s individual challenge qualifiers began.
Four grades at the same time, a total of six training grounds were used. MO Xiu finally understood why Yanjing University had to build so many training grounds..

                    



Chapter 81: In-Campus Single Challenge (1)

The first grade group was assigned to the seventh training field. At this moment, the second floor of the seventh training field was completely opened up. The walls of all the rooms slowly fell down and embedded into the ground.
This design was very novel, turning the entire second floor into a huge square.
The lights in the arena shone brightly, making Moxiu feel as if he had returned to the Underground Arena.
There were only four competition venues in the center of the entire square. The rest of the place was filled with spectators.
“Dear first year students, the exciting time of the year has arrived. Some of you are excited and nervous because you have advanced to the internal competition, while some of you can only become spectators because you have not advanced.”
“But it doesn’t matter. You still have a chance. As long as you maintain your competitiveness at all times, you will be the ones standing in the center of the arena next year!
“Now! Whether you are a participant or a spectator, let us enjoy this feast together. Please welcome the participants!!!”
“First, the power attack system with the best overall results last year! ! The eight contestants walked to the center of the field and received the cheers of the audience.
Next was the elemental system, agility system, ability system, and finally the support system that Moxiu was in.
The number of people in each system was different. There were eight power attack system members, eight elemental system members, six agility and ability system members, and four support system members.
There were a total of thirty-two people. The number of people participating in the competition every year was fixed at thirty-two. The spots for each department this year were distributed according to the results of the previous year.
Last year, in the individual competition, the power attack and elemental
classes were ranked second in total, so they were allocated eight spots. The support classes were at the bottom, so they only had four spots. To put it bluntly, it was like the predecessors planted trees and the future generations took advantage of them.
The rules of the individual competition were very simple. Each contestant would have four matches, and their opponents would be random. The top eight would be chosen based on their results.
In order to avoid eliminating the stronger contestants and maintain fairness, each department had a seeded contestant.
The Power Assault System and the Elemental System had eight participants, so they could choose two seeded players. The other three systems only had one seeded player.
There were a total of seven seeds. These seven people would not meet each other to prevent the seeded contestants from being eliminated.
The individual competition was divided into four days. Every day, everyone would have a match. Time was tight, and the main reason for the rush was to give the students more time to prepare for the team battle.
It was worth mentioning that MO Xiu had two acquaintances in the other Elements. One was Liu Ziyang from the Agility Element, and the other was Zhou Qiuwu from the Power Attack Element.
Liu Ziyang’s skills were more suitable for teamwork. He was not particularly strong on his own, so he was not the strongest among Agility Attacks. Even so, he still fought his way up. The pressure he had been under during this period of time was also quite high. This was also the reason why he did not contact Moxiu.
Zhou Qiuwu was a seed of the power attack system. Looking at the state of the eight power attack system players, Zhou Qiuwu seemed to be the leader.
MO Xiu knew very well that his strongest opponent was most likely Zhou Qiuwu, who came from the same high school as him.
After all, it was the first day of the annual inter-school battle, so the host did another round of warm-up.
Most of the audience members were first-year students, and there were very few people from other grades.
Because the four grade matches were held at the same time, everyone wanted to pay more attention to their potential opponents and pay attention to the matches of the same grade.
The host warmed up and explained the rules. After more than half an hour, the competition began.
The opponents were completely random, but the order of appearance could be arranged.
The school had placed Zhou Qiuwu’s match as the first to open the competition.
It could be seen that Zhou Qiuwu was highly regarded. Moreover, from the cheers in the stadium, his popularity was also very high.
MO Xiu wasn’t in the first four groups, which gave MO Xiu a chance to see Zhou Qiuwu’s performance.
He shouted,” The match begins!” After that, the host did not say another word. After all, it was a formal competition in the school, different from the underground arena.
The host of the Underground Arena would also talk non-stop during the battle to raise the audience’s mood, while the host of the official competition would keep quiet so as not to affect the performance of the contestants.
Although there were four groups, most people were attracted by Zhou Qiuwu’s group.
Zhou Qiuwu’s opponent was a student from the Agility Faculty. The opponent knew how powerful Zhou Qiuwu was, so he activated his skill at the beginning of the match, wanting to seize the opportunity.
This Agility System student’s skill was similar to a clone. He could form a second self at an extremely fast speed. The two of them could attack at the same time. One was fake and the other was real. It was difficult to distinguish between fake and real.
Zhou Qiuwu activated his skill expressionlessly. He spread his hands to both sides, and a glowing circle appeared on the ground. A silver spear slowly rose from the circle.
He held the spear in his right hand and swung it to the side, showing some decisiveness before going into battle.
Moxiu still had a match to attend, so he didn’t use God’s Sight. He didn’t know how strong the skill was, but this was definitely the coolest skill effect Moxiu had ever seen.
Looking at the silver spear’s magnificence, it was definitely not simple.
Also, weapons were not allowed in the competition, but the opponent’s skill was a weapon. This was equivalent to cheating.
The spear emphasized agility. According to MO Xiu’s understanding, the spear had to be coordinated with a nimble movement technique. It could not be restricted by the spear. The spear should use the spear flexibly in order to win by surprise.
However, Zhou Qiuwu didn’t do that. He didn’t even move, let alone his movement technique. His feet were as steady as roots, and he didn’t even wave his spear. He just stuck it straight into the ground.
In the beginning, MO Xiu thought that Zhou Qiuwu didn’t know how to use a spear, and that he should learn how to use a spear.
However, the moment Zhou Qiuwu’s spear moved, MO Xiu knew that this person would be the strongest opponent in his four years in university.
When his opponent got close to Zhou Qiuwu, Zhou Qiuwu quickly struck out with his spear. It was so fast that no one could see it clearly. They only felt a
silver shadow flash past.
The opponent stood still on the spot. Moxiu focused his gaze and saw that the tip of the spear was already pressed against the opponent’s throat. This highly anticipated opening match had ended just like that.
Zhou Qiuwu only used one move and a simple spear attack.
MO Xiu frowned and pondered. Zhou Qiuwu did not even look at his opponent just now, but he was able to distinguish his opponent’s true body. It should be the spear skill that increased his perception.
There was also the speed. The speed of that spear was too fast. Even Moxiu himself did not have the confidence to dodge it.
“Divine Spear Zhou Qiu! Divine Spear Zhou Qiuwu!”
Overwhelming cheers filled the entire stadium. In the noisy environment, MO Xiu saw Zhou Qiuwu look in his direction. He didn’t know if it was his imagination.
Following that, there were two more matches. Each match was very exciting, and Moxiu was also watching with great interest. There were all kinds of skills, and the flexible application of each skill was quite interesting to study.
During the last four groups in the morning, Moxiu’s name was called.
“Next up are the last four groups in the morning. After these four groups are over, we will have a lunch break and continue in the afternoon. The next four groups are the support-type seeded player MO Xiu versus the elemental-type Zhang He. ”
“Support-type?” Zhang He asked after entering the arena. I’m not afraid of you even if you’re a seeded player. Don’t let me beat you until you cry!”
“We’ll know if there’s anyone who can fight,” Moxiu replied with a smile..”

                    



Chapter 82: The First Battle

Moxiu immediately activated God’s Snooping.
‘ Skill 1: Consecutive Flame Bullets 2
[Skill effect: Fire 20 fireballs to kill within 5 minutes]
[Cooldown: 6 hours
If there was a skill that God’s Sight had the worst detection effect on, it would definitely be an elemental skill.
This was because he could not detect how strong the damage of the elemental skills was.
“Let the competition begin!”
As the host announced the start of the match, Zhang He ran towards MO Xiu. It seemed like Zhang He didn’t know MO Xiu. Usually, before participating in the competition, the contestants would investigate the contestants from other Elements. After all, knowing oneself and knowing the enemy was a surefire way to win.
Even the weakest would investigate the strongest players of the other
Elements to find out whether the opponent was strong or weak.
However, the support system was an exception. If the support system had the slightest bit of competition in the team competition, then the individual competition was basically for nothing.
In the past competitions, even the seed players of the support system rarely advanced. The reason was simple. The biggest role of the support system was to help the team win. It didn’t exist.
According to Moxiu’s estimation, as long as he dodged Zhang He’s Flame Bullet, he would be able to obtain victory, so he was not in a hurry to use his skill.
What puzzled Moxiu was that Zhang He’s skill seemed to be a long-range skill.
Why was he in a hurry to close the distance?
In the next moment, Moxiu understood. Zhang He’s hands were like claws, and flames appeared on his palms. This should be a Flame Bullet, but it wasn’t fired.
It seemed that Zhang He wanted to use the Flame Bullet in close combat. This was an interesting tactic. This way, he could avoid the consumption of the Flame Bullet and also use the high temperature of the flame to increase his attack power.
Zhang He’s claw struck, but MO Xiu took a step back to dodge it. The flames streaked across MO Xiu’s face.
The temperature of the flames was not low, and the power of the flame bomb was probably not small either.
After dodging the attack, Moxiu quickly rushed forward. The distance between the two was only a fist’s distance. This made it difficult for Zhang He to wave his flames and attack.
Moxiu didn’t punch either. Instead, he used his elbow to continuously hit Zhang He’s abdomen.
Zhang He did not expect MO Yuqi to suddenly make a move and take these attacks head-on without being prepared.
After suffering this loss, Zhang He immediately took a few steps back and looked at MO Xiu in surprise.
MO Xiu didn’t chase after him. He wanted to see how Zhang He would respond.
Zhang He said,” I really didn’t expect that a support-type person would have such combat ability. Shouldn’t the basic skills of a support-type person be to escape and take a beating?
This was a misconception of many people. They thought that the job of a Support was to hide obediently after releasing the Support skill and not push them back.
In fact, during the month that Moxiu had been studying in the Support Element, he had discovered that most of his classmates were not bad at actual combat. They might not know any martial arts moves, but their foundations in speed and strength were very solid.
“I don’t think you know how to escape, nor do you know how to take a
beating.’”‘
“You…” Zhang He said excitedly. Stubborn!”
Then, he approached Moxiu and attacked with the same claw attack as before.
Moxiu narrowed his eyes. Just like last time, he took a step back and dodged this attack.
This time, the flames stopped when they brushed past Moxiu’s face.
“Sou!”
The flame bomb was fired at Moxiu’s face. Moxiu was already prepared. He knew that there was something strange about Zhang He using the same move. So he was waiting here.
The speed at which the Flame Bullet was fired was very fast, but Motheo still reacted in time and did a backflip to dodge the Flame Bullet.
As soon as he landed on the ground, Zhang He took advantage of the fact that Moxiu had yet to regain his balance and fired six Flame Bullets in a row. The positions of the Flame Bullets almost surrounded Moxiu.
The fireball would explode when it came into contact with an object. The explosion of the six fireballs caused the smoke and dust in the area where Moxiu had been standing to fill up, and Moxiu’s figure could not be seen for a moment.
Zhang He excitedly raised his hands to celebrate the victory. After being hit by six Flame Bullets, even Zhou Qiuwu would not be safe. He did not expect to kill a seeded player in the first round. It was a good start.
“Ah!” Zhang He shouted at the audience.!! Remember me, my name is Zhang He! I will advance to the top eight.”
The audience’s expression was normal at first, but it slowly became dull. Zhang He looked back in confusion.
As the dust settled, MO Xiu’s shirt was tattered from the heat. However, it was clear that MO Xiu was not injured at all.
Zhang He looked at MO Xiu as if he had seen a ghost.
“You… Why are you fine? I know, your skill is healing.”
MO Xiu looked at his sorry state and shook his head.”l haven’t even released my skills yet, and you’re already celebrating your victory? Aren’t you being too careless? Someone like you can’t enter the top eight at all.”
“Shut up!” Zhang He said angrily.”
Following that, another Flame Bullet was fired, and Moxiu quickly dodged it.
Seeing MO Xiu’s speed more than double, Zhang He was a little stunned.
Just now, Moxiu had activated the Descent of the Martial God at the same time that Zhang He had fired the six Flame Bullets. Although the speed of the Flame Bullets was fast, they were not as fast as bullets.
Moxiu could even dodge a bullet, let alone a flame bomb. If it wasn’t for the fact that he was testing the power of the flame bomb, his shirt wouldn’t have been damaged.
Zhang He pointed at MO Xiu and said,” Your speed has increased a lot. Support skills definitely can’t do it. Your skills aren’t support skills at all. You’re an agility-type skill.””
MO Xiu thought of Yang Qingzhuo’s insane skills and said, “Can’t do it? I can only say that your knowledge is too shallow. Also, my skill doesn’t only increase speed!”
After MO Xiu finished speaking, he didn’t give Zhang He another chance. He kicked off the ground with his feet and attacked Zhang He at his fastest speed.
Zhang He panicked when he saw Moxiu’s current speed. He put his hands together, and about ten Flame Bullets appeared between his hands.
MO Xiu immediately understood Zhang He’s intention. He gathered the ten flame bombs together and fired them to increase their power.
However, Moxiu’s speed was simply too fast. Before Zhang He could fire the Flame Bullet in his hand, he had already arrived beside him.
“No matter how powerful it is, what’s the use if it can’t hit people?” he said softly.”
MO Xiu punched Zhang He’s stomach. Zhang He’s eyes bulged and he almost lost consciousness. The flame bomb in his hand also dissipated.
After Zhang He realized that something was wrong, he immediately opened his mouth and wanted to admit defeat. MO Xiu did not give him a chance and directly kicked him out of the boundary, almost injuring the audience.
‘ Don’t underestimate the support system,” Moxiu said coldly.” What if a small support system that can fight appears?’”‘
In the crowd, Zhou Qiuwu turned around and left after seeing the results.
The day’s matches ended. The results of the four support system members were: MO Xiu and Xiao Lan had won, while Dong Fang and Xue Ling ‘er had lost.
This result was not unexpected. Xue Ling ‘er was a support, so she would definitely be weaker than the students from other faculties who were good at fighting.
Needless to say, Dong Fang was able to advance because he had applied for the support system. If he had applied for the power attack system, it was basically impossible for him to advance.
Liu Ziyang had encountered a seeded player of the Elemental System in his first match and was unfortunately defeated. In his own words, he said,””
When MO Xiu returned home, Yang Qingzhuo was eating hotpot with Little Fushun.
“Why didn’t you wait for me to eat hotpot?”
“We wanted to wait for you, but we couldn’t hold back!” Yang Qingzhuo said playfully. ”
Little Fushun was becoming more and more understanding, and he nodded cooperatively. “MO Xiu, how was your match today?”
“We won! Let’s eat!”

                    



Chapter 83: Another Battle (1)

Little Fushun’s body had grown from the size of a palm to the size of an arm.
Not only did he grow in size, but he also grew curious. These few days, Little Fushun was especially naughty and rummaged through the cabinets to play.
Originally, Yang Qingzhuo wanted to follow MO Xiu to watch the match at school. However, MO Xiu was worried about Little Fushun and was afraid that he would cause some trouble, so he asked Yang Qingzhuo to stay at home to watch him.
The relationship between the two was also very good. After all, they had a common hobby… They ate meat. They had been eating hotpot every day for the past few days. One day, they didn’t eat meat. Yang Qingzhuo and Little Fushun went on a hunger strike to protest, making MO Xiu suffer.
Not long after, Zheng Yi returned. The moment he returned, he asked,” MO Xiu, how was your match? It’s not embarrassing, right?” “Don’t worry, it won’t be embarrassing.’”‘
“That’s good. I heard some insider news. Do you want to hear it?”
“If you have something to say, say it quickly…”
Zheng Yi smiled mysteriously and said,””Don’t you want to know about Yang Qingfeng?”
“Tell me, I’ll treat you to hotpot.’
Zheng Yi rolled his eyes and said, “Are you sure you want to invite me?” Forget it, seeing that you’re pretty good to me, I’ll tell you.”
“I heard that Yang Qingfeng was found to be the murderer. He was suspected in the past, but now the school has found evidence that he was the murder weapon.”
“A pistol?”
” That’s right, a pistol. Yang Qingfeng and Zhang Nana had a conflict. Zhang
Nana cheated on Yang Qingfeng, and then…”
Seeing Zheng Yi’s lewd smile, MO Xiu immediately interrupted,””Alright, there’s no need to say this. Let’s continue with the business.”
“I heard that Yang Qingfeng had planned to kill Zhang Nana. He deliberately invited Zhang Nana to the back of the teaching building to kill her without anyone knowing.”
MO Xiu gestured with his right hand as if he was holding a pistol and said, “Then where did this come from?”
“Yang Qingfeng won’t tell me even if I beat him to death. Maybe the source doesn’t want to tell me.” Zheng Yi shook his head.”
This information seemed useful, but it only confirmed Cao Fenglin’s statement. Without knowing the origin of the gun, the clues were still broken.
However, Zheng Yi was really good at gathering information, and he was as good as Hao Ren.
Although Zheng Yi used to be a rich kid, he didn’t like to hang out with his friends. He didn’t have many friends in high school.
But now, Zheng Yi was socializing with people from all walks of life to get information about his goddess.
MO Xiu had only seen pictures of Goddess Zheng Yi, but he had never seen her in person. He did not know who had charmed Zheng Yi so much.
MO Xiu didn’t ask any more questions. Everyone sat down to eat.
Recently, he had been eating meat. Due to the school competition, Moxiu didn’t have time to do missions, so he couldn’t make ends meet.
Fortunately, there were Zheng Yi and Liu Ziyang, two rich second-generation heirs, to fill the gap. Otherwise, MO Xiu’s money might have been spent.
Little Fushun was a little puzzled. He wasn’t a cat, was he? All of his forms and even his meows were very similar. The black stripes on its back were somewhat mysterious.
He wondered if Little Fushun had any innate skills. If he did, why hadn’t he shown them yet?
He was speechless for a night.
The next morning, Moxiu went to the No. 3 Martial Arts Field alone.
Mumu had instructed him yesterday to make a trip to the department’s stadium before today’s competition.
MO Xiu had arrived a little early, so Mu Mu was the only one there.
Mu Mu was writing something on the table with a serious expression, so much so that MO Xiu didn’t notice him when he came in.
MO Xiu did not disturb her and sat down opposite her.
Mu Mu was writing and drawing in his notebook. He was probably concluding yesterday’s match.
Mu Mu was writing furiously. One moment, he frowned as if something unbelievable had happened. The next moment, he let out a sigh of relief as if he had solved a difficult problem.
He suddenly raised his head and realized that Moxiu was looking at him. “Moxiu, you’re here. Wait for a while. When they come, I’ll tell them together.”
MO Xiu nodded his head and made an inviting gesture with his hand, indicating for Mu Mu to continue.
Mu Mu stood up and said,” I’m sorry to call everyone here so early in the morning. I watched each of your matches yesterday and wanted to say a few words.”
“Dong Fang, your advantage is your defense. Yesterday, you were at a disadvantage when you faced the power attack system. The ones you have the most hope of defeating are the agility attack system and elemental attack system students. After this period of training, your speed has increased a lot. Most of the agility attack system students don’t have enough attack power, so you have an advantage. As for the elemental attack system, most people can only use their skills once.”
“Xiao Lan, it seems that the willpower training during this period of time has not been of much use to you. I was quite disappointed in your match yesterday. You didn’t bring out the fighting spirit you should have.”
“Xue Ling ‘er, you are already at a disadvantage…”
“MO Xiu, continue to maintain your performance. You won’t meet any seeded contestants from other divisions. It’s relatively stable, and you won’t have any problems advancing.”
Next, Mu Mu gave everyone a detailed analysis of how to deal with different types of opponents.
MO Xiu admired this lady from the bottom of his heart. She was serious, responsible, and hardworking. No wonder she could help Cao Fenglin walk out of this predicament.
Mu Mu was in charge of the group battle, and Cao Fenglin’s intention was also to focus on the group battle. He could have ignored the individual battles between the four of them, but she still did a lot for them. Everyone knew her good intentions and was grateful from the bottom of her heart.
After the explanation, the five of them went to the competition venue of the No. 7 martial arts field.
Today was the second match. After listening to Mu Mu’s analysis and pre-match mobilization, everyone was very motivated.
Today, the host did not warm up the match. Once the time was up, he immediately announced the start of the match.
MO Xiu was the last to play, so he had time to watch the people he was following.
The first to go up was still Zhou Qiuwu. The school seemed to have intentionally arranged for him to be at the front. The battle was still as simple as before, ending the battle with only one shot.
He had wanted to see Zhou Qiuwu’s second skill, but he did not see it. It was a pity.
After that was Liu Ziyang. This time, he met an Elementalist.
Liu Ziyang had the advantage of speed and was able to restrain his opponent, so he won relatively easily.
According to his own words, it was the turn of the wheel.
Then, it was Dong Fang and Ling ‘er. The two of them used the tactics of the Cleansing Eye Sect to fight until the end, but they were unfortunately defeated because they were not strong enough.
Even if the two of them lost, they didn’t let their opponents have an easy time. They fought until the last moment, and neither of them was happy about winning.
Finally, it was Xiao Lan. Xiao Lan had encountered a seeded esper, and the battle was unusually intense.
The opponent was only slightly stronger than Xiao Lan. Xiao Lan did not show any desire to win, and she still did not shoot out the blue flames.
MO Xiu was getting more and more confused by Xiao Lan. If not shooting flames was to hide her strength, then why did she show no fighting spirit throughout the entire match?
Following that, Xiao Lan was forced out of the ring. If she lost this match, she would basically have no chance of entering the top eight.
MO Xiu felt that it was a pity. Xiao Lan definitely had the strength to make it into the top eight.
Mu Mu, who was standing at the side, was even more disappointed. He shook his head and sighed.
Finally, it was MO Xiu’s turn to go on stage. His opponent was still an Elementalist called He Xu.
He Xu had obviously heard some rumors and knew that MO Xiu was very strong and not easy to deal with. His expression was very serious.
Moxiu was helpless.. Why did he have to go against the Elemental Element?

                    



Chapter 84: Your Competition Is Quite a Waste of Clothes

” Skill 1: Raging Tornado 2
[Skill Effect: Summons a tornado with a diameter of 30 meters. It will stun the target and cause continuous damage.]
[Casting time: 2 seconds] [Duration: 5 seconds]
[Cooldown time: 3 hours]
Moxiu used God’s Sight on He Xu as usual. He was shocked when he saw the effect of the skill.
Although he didn’t know how long the stun lasted or how high the damage was, just from the range of the skill, it was terrifying.
The entire arena was only 50 meters, and the diameter of the tornado was 30 meters. As long as He Xu released a skill, it was basically impossible to dodge.
However, He Xu’s skill had a weakness, which was the casting time of the first time. This casting time was the time from the release of the skill to the appearance of the tornado.
“Let the competition begin!”
MO Xiu was already prepared to launch a fierce attack at the start of the match and end the match within He Xu’s chanting time.
This way, he could avoid trouble and win the game in the safest way.
The moment the match began, Moxiu activated the Descent of the Martial God and advanced at full speed.
However, MO Xiu had miscalculated. Those who could enter the internal selection were all extremely powerful, let alone a major Element Element.
He Xu was well aware of the weakness of his skill. He had been observing the emcee just now, but he had actually released his skill before the start of the match. Just as the emcee finished speaking, the chanting time ended and a tornado appeared on the ground.
MO Xiu had only taken two steps when he realized that something was wrong.
A tornado had appeared under his feet, and he was in the center of the tornado. It seemed that He Xu had planned this all along.
In an instant, MO Xiu reacted. It was impossible for him to run out of the tornado’s range now. He changed his strategy to retreat and tried to stay as far away from He Xu as possible.
Because he didn’t know how long the tornado would last, he had to avoid He Xu from dealing a second blow to him when he was stunned.
The wind was fast and rapid, directly sending Moxiu flying into the air. At this moment, Moxiu felt his brain stop for less than a second. It seemed like he was dizzy.
After that, Moxiu was swept into the center of the tornado. The wind around him was as cold as a knife.
Five seconds later, the wind stopped. Moxiu slowly landed on the ground, his clothes tattered.
Fortunately, the wind blades did not break through his defense, and MO Xiu was not injured.
Although he wasn’t injured, Moxiu still had lingering fears. The Wind Blade’s damage was just barely able to break through his defense. If the damage was a little stronger, Moxiu would be in a sorry state right now.
Moxiu sighed. He had been too careless. If he had thought of the opponent’s tactics before the match began, he might have been able to avoid being hit and win much easier.
The wind completely dissipated as MO Xiu walked towards He Xu step by step. He Xu shook his head helplessly and shouted at the host, “I admit defeat!”
Then, he said to Moxiu,”l really didn’t expect that there would be someone like you in the support system.”
Moxiu spread his hands and said, “This year, the support system will surprise you.””
He Xu cupped his fists and said,”l’m waiting to see!””
The competition had ended. MO Ting was the last to compete today, so it was a little late when he got home. Yang Qingzhuo, Zheng Yi, and Little Fushun were waiting in front of the hotpot.
Yang Qingzhuo was almost drooling.
Yang Qingzhuo saw MO Xiu’s tattered clothes and asked with concern, “MO Xiu, are you alright? The clothes were ruined yesterday, and they were ruined today!”
“MO Xiu, you’re wearing a lot of clothes in the competition!” Zheng Yi mocked from the side. How was the match?”
“There’s no problem with the competition. We won, but why are you eating hotpot again? Aren’t you sick of it?”
Yang Qingzhuo and Little Fushun had already started eating, so they didn’t have the time to bother with MO Xiu.
“What are you tired of?” Zheng Yi asked. You won’t get sick of eating meat.
Besides, it used to be a clear soup pot, but today it’s a spicy pot. Come and eat!”
After Moxiu returned to his room to change his clothes, he returned to the kitchen. Just as he sat down, he saw Little Fushun stuffing himself with food. He knocked Little Fushun on the head with his chopsticks. “It’s spicy. Eat less. Have you forgotten when you had diarrhea?”
‘ Meow!
Little Fu Shun growled at MO Xiu, dissatisfied that MO Xiu had exposed his weakness.
MO Xiu rubbed Little Fu Shun’s head with all his might, causing him to be dazed. After a while, he continued to eat meat.
On the third and fourth days, MO Xiu won without any suspense. None of his opponents were weak.
In the end, the battle records of the four support system members were: MO
Xiu had four wins and zero losses, Xiao Lan had three wins and one loss, Dong Fang had one win and three losses, and Xue Linger had zero wins and four losses.
At the end of the competition, the host said,” The individual qualifiers have ended. Every contestant has done their best and contributed one wonderful match after another to us. Please wait a moment. The staff is tabulating the results and will announce the top eight in a moment.””
In fact, if some people were to record their achievements, they would have known who would advance.
MO Xiu had four wins and zero losses, and he was also a seeded player. The top eight was very stable, so he was not worried at all.
Ten minutes later, the results were out. It was a little surprising. Out of the seven seeded players, six had advanced. One of the seeded players had been eliminated, and it was a seeded player of the power attack system.
Among the eight who had advanced, there was one power attack type, which was Zhou Qiuwu, two element type seeds, one agility attack type seed, three ability type seeds, and MO Xiu, the support type seed.
This result was beyond everyone’s expectations. The strongest power attack system only had one person advance. Last year, the ability system, which was second to last in total, had defeated a power attack system seed and advanced three people.
Moxiu was also very puzzled. None of his four opponents were Esper, so he didn’t know what was going on.
He asked the people around him, but they were all dumbfounded.
At this moment, Moxiu called Hao Ren. This know-it-all should know what was going on, right?
Hao Ren didn’t disappoint Moxiu and told him the real reason.
After hearing the reason, Moxiu praised the Esper Ability Department’s teacher for being a tactical genius.
The reason for the sudden rise of the Esper class was simple: the suppression of the number of skills.
The ability department chose two students whose birthdays were before August 1st. In other words, before the on-campus one-on-one competition began, these two people already had two skills.
In the past, other faculties had tried this method, but it was not ideal. Because there were very few students whose birthdays were before August 1st, there might not be very strong students. Moreover, there was uncertainty. No one could predict the strength of the second skill. If the second skill that this person awakened was very weak, then the gains would not make up for the losses.
However, this year, he had been blinded by the ability department. The two students who had birthdays before August were not weak, and the second skills they had awakened were very strong.
In a situation where there was no absolute advantage, two skills could definitely suppress one skill. This was also the reason why the school encouraged competitions but protected the lower grade students.
These two dark horses of the ability system had won all four battles and were invincible.
That power attack system seed was also unlucky. He had met both of these dark horses and lost two matches in a row, not having a chance to enter the top eight.
When the list of the top eight was complete, there was a pleasant surprise. MO Xiu couldn’t believe his ears.
Du Ya, the member of the strongest club, had entered the top eight. That unruly woman, the woman who looked down on MO Xiu.
The two of them looked at each other. Moxiu could see the shock in Duya’s eyes.
The reason why Du Ya joined the strongest club was very simple. She did not participate in the selection and directly participated in the club’s solo competition.
From the beginning to the end, he did not have any hope for the team battle.. Seeing that Moxiu had actually entered the top eight, there might be hope for the team battle…

                    



Chapter 85: The Strongest Club Moves Out

On the 5th of August, Mumu announced the holidays. Firstly, there was still nearly a month before the team battle in the school, so there was no need to train every day. Secondly, it was to make time for the students participating in the team battle.
Finally, he had some free time. Moxiu waved his hand and prepared to carry out his duties as the president of the club.
This conference was very successful because even Du Ya had come.
Du Ya changed her attitude of not liking MO Xiu and actually started to look at MO Xiu seriously.
When everyone asked about the reason for the change in attitude, she only left a famous quote.
“Only the strong deserve respect.”
This was obviously an acknowledgment of Moxiu’s strength and the fact that he was the president of the strongest club.
Hao Ren, Liu Ziyang, Yang Qingzhuo, Dong Fang, He Lingyue, and Du Ya sat in their seats.
MO Xiu spoke frankly at the front.
“As the president of the strongest guild, the individual and team competitions aren’t far away. I’ve decided to start training.”
The people below the stage were all very surprised. The strongest club was actually going to train. This was really the sun rising from the west.
MO Xiu continued to say, “Yanjing University’s education method is competition education. I appreciate this kind of competition method, but I still feel that it’s not enough. ‘”‘
‘ President, ” Hao Ren asked seriously,” what’s wrong with this education method?” “It’s full of competition and can help everyone grow quickly. I feel that the competition education method is at least one or two levels ahead of other universities.”
“Vice-President Hao is right. This method is indeed very good for the school, but if we want to truly improve, I feel that the competitive pressure is not enough. We also need a sense of crisis, the kind of crisis where we will be seriously injured if we are not careful.”
The others were still a little confused, but He Lingyue was the first to react.
“Moxiu, I see that you’ve accepted some kind of mission that you want everyone to complete together, right?”
Moxiu corrected him.” What you said isn’t completely correct. I did accept a mission that requires everyone to complete together, but the order was wrong. I didn’t accept the mission because I wanted everyone to complete it together. I accepted the mission because I wanted to hone everyone’s combat ability and team cooperation.”
As soon as MO Xiu said this, the six of them thought that there were two factions. One faction was Dong Fang, Yang Qingzhuo, and Du Ya. They believed
MO Xiu’s words.
Dong Fang was simple-minded and didn’t think too much about it. Yang Qingzhuo was MO Xiu’s little fan, so he believed everything he said.
Du Ya simply didn’t understand MO Xiu. She didn’t know that MO Xiu, who usually looked serious, would occasionally joke around.
The other faction was He Lingyue, Liu Ziyang, and Hao Ren. MO Xiu’s words were too fake. He must have dragged them into this mess for the points and cash.
However, no matter which faction it was, no one objected to Moxiu’s suggestion.
At this time, everyone had some time. Moreover, after forming the seven-man team, they had not acted together, so they did not know each other very well. It was a good opportunity to get to know each other.
Looking at everyone’s expressions, MO Xiu boasted shamelessly,””Since no one has any objections, then it’s settled.”
Then, he took out six documents and handed them to everyone. These were the mission information.
The previous two large-scale missions, one was the Underground Arena, and the other was to capture Wang Jinyang. Both were investigative missions.
This time, it was different. This time, it was a simple and brutal mission to eliminate.
He opened the first page of the information.
” Extermination Quest: Catfish
[Difficulty Level: C]
[Mission Completion Requirement: Kill or capture all members.]
[Mission Reward: 2000 points, 1 million cash reward (15% of the reward will be deducted for every member who escapes)]” ” Annihilation Quest: Bandit Blackhand Cao Xiao Gang
[Mission Level: B]
Mission details: ‘
After looking through the information, there were a total of twenty-seven missions. Most of the missions were C and D in difficulty, and some of them were B. The few people from the strongest society should be able to handle them.
The targets of the mission were all people on the edge of society who gathered together to commit crimes. This should have been the job of the law enforcement team, but ever since the skill appeared, the crime rate had increased. Moreover, some people’s skills were suitable for committing crimes, making it difficult to catch them.
Therefore, the focus of the law enforcement team was to ensure the safety of the city. Such organizations would appear in some ungoverned areas outside the city.
‘ President, you accepted all 27 missions?” Hao Ren asked in surprise.”
” That’s right.” Moxiu nodded.” The time limit for the mission is two months.
There shouldn’t be any problems.’”‘
“These organizations all have people. We only have one skill. Can we do it?” Liu Ziyang said with some worry.”
“Why not?” asked Du Ya. If we can get into Yanjing University, it proves that we are stronger than them. If they really have the ability, we will be classmates. I agree with Moxiu’s decision and have decided to follow the team to carry out the mission.”
The first person to stand up and support Moxiu was actually Du Ya, whom he was most unfamiliar with. Moxiu was also a little puzzled.
He Lingyue also said,” I agree. Last time we completed Wang Jinyang’s mission together, I think it was very helpful to everyone’s growth. This is something that the school competition can’t bring us. I also agree. ‘”‘
The two women stood up to express their opinions. The others also supported them. Only Yang Qingzhuo did not say anything.
But it didn’t matter. Yang Qingzhuo would listen to MO Xiu and didn’t need to express his opinion.
Moxiu was very satisfied with everyone’s reaction. Actually, he had accepted these missions because he really wanted to improve his actual combat ability. It could not be said that the competition was not an actual battle, but it was ultimately a lack of a sense of urgency when fighting.
“Since everyone has unanimously agreed, let’s find a gang to try it out today?”
“No problem!”
“Good!”
“I can’t wait!”
In the evening, the seven members of the Strongest Club returned to the club activity room.
Today, they had spent an entire day to wipe out a small group of eight people. The mission level was D.
Du Ya took the lead and said,” We originally blocked the eight people in the room. Dong Fang, you were in charge of blocking the door. Where did you go after that?” If it weren’t for the fact that four of us ran out, would we have to go through so much trouble?”
I was in charge of blocking the door,” Dong Fang said, feeling wronged.” But I saw someone trying to escape through the window, so I went to stop him. Why don’t you say Yang Qingzhuo and Liu Ziyang, who were in charge of chasing after him?””
Liu Ziyang was not very happy either. He sighed and said,”Sigh, I was entangled at that time. That kid, he… He is full of evil tricks, and if I am not careful, I will have no descendants.”
This time, the mission was finally completed, but it was a little embarrassing. They had exposed the problem of the strongest club not cooperating well, but the root cause of the mission not going smoothly was that everyone’s thinking was too simple.
In real combat, one would fight with one’s life. There were no restrictions on the venue, and if the opponent couldn’t win, they could run away. There were no rules, and there were all kinds of weapons and traps.
Those who had never experienced such a battle style were not used to it, including Moxiu.
Now everyone was talking about their own things. It was a mess.
Moxiu shouted loudly, ” Alright, everyone, stop. Stop arguing. There are two things that we didn’t do well in this mission. First, we didn’t have a perfect plan. This is my responsibility. Second, we didn’t treat them as villains or students..”

                    



Chapter 86: The Opening of the Society Battle

‘ Our mission didn’t go well this time,” Hao Ren asked.” Will it be dangerous to continue the mission?””
‘ Yeah,” He Lingyue said worriedly.” No matter what, we have to focus on the competition. If we get injured while carrying out the mission, it won’t be worth it.”
“Do you think the mission was unsuccessful?” Moxiu shrugged. I think it was very successful.”
Everyone looked at MO Xiu strangely. He succeeded? He almost failed to complete such a small mission.
Seeing that everyone was not confident, MO Xiu said with a pained expression, “Sigh! You’ve disappointed me!”
This time, everyone was even more confused.
“Have you forgotten the purpose of our meeting this morning?
“It’s for training! It was precisely because the effect of the first mission was not good that it proved that it had a tempering effect. We found the place where we should improve, and this was very successful.”
MO Xiuji shook his head in disappointment.
“Sigh! You saw your own weakness and knew how to improve, yet you want to give up? With such a lack of fighting spirit, do you have the nerve to call yourself a student of Yanjing University?”
The six of them felt a little embarrassed by Moxiu’s words. Although they felt that something was wrong, what he said was indeed very reasonable. How could they give up on an opportunity to improve when there was difficulty?
IVIOXILI stood up and lett tne classroom atter saying tnat.
‘ Gather here at eight o’clock tomorrow morning. Think about it when you go back. Those who want to continue the mission must be on time. Those who don’t want to come…Sigh!”
When Yang Qingzhuo saw MO Xiu leave, he also ran out.
Liu Ziyang and MO Xiu were going the same way. They had to take Qiang Zi’s car back to the Yunding Villa Complex, so they followed him out.
Dong Fang, He Lingyue, Hao Ren, and Du Ya looked at each other.
Finally, Hao Ren whispered, ‘”‘1 heard that there’s an organization called MLM. I’m a little suspicious now. I’ve been brainwashed and can’t think normally.”
The next morning, August 6th, in the activity room of the Strongest Club.
At eight o’clock, Moxiu pushed open the door on time. Seeing that everyone was there, he smiled in relief.
Hao Ren immediately said,” That’s enough, President. You don’t have to say those words to stir up emotions. With just one word from you, can we not participate in the mission?
‘ Hahaha!” Moxiu laughed loudly.” That’s good. Let’s go!” Today, I will strive to complete a few missions.”
As yesterday’s mission did not go smoothly, Moxiu mainly chose a D-rank mission today. The difficulty was relatively low, so he wanted to practice first.
For today’s first mission, Moxiu had made a detailed plan. Everyone’s mission was clear. If one of them had an emergency, who could support them and who could not? Everything was arranged.
This time, it was an organization of ten people. All ten of them were students who had not been admitted to university. Their crimes did not warrant death, so MO Xiu ordered them to be captured alive.
This mission was very successful. In just an hour, they captured all ten of them. However, this was also the simplest mission.
On that day, he completed a total of five D-rank missions, which was all the D -rank missions.
After a day of missions, the seven of them gradually formed a system.
In terms of preparation work, Hao Ren was responsible for collecting intelligence and selecting missions, MO Xiu and He Lingyue were responsible for laying out tactics based on the available intelligence, Dong Fang and Liu Ziyang were responsible for logistics, and Yang Qingzhuo and Du Ya were responsible for collecting trophies.
Dong Fang was no longer in charge of blocking the entrance and was now the vanguard.
Du Ya was strong and was responsible for the main attack. She was the person with the highest damage output on the battlefield.
He Lingyue used her skills to judge the situation on the field and was in charge of on-the-spot command.
Yang Qingzhuo and Liu Ziyang were the fastest and were in charge of chasing after them.
Moxiu was a free man, so he would fill in any gaps.
This distribution was not planned out, but came about after a day of battle experiments.
In just one day, the seven members of the strongest club had transformed from a flustered team into an impeccable team. During this time, Moxiu also read Duya’s skill.
” Skill 1: Five Elements Armor 3
[Skill effect: Full-enveloping armor covers the entire body. The armor is divided into five forms and can be switched freely.]
(Gold Form: Defense increased by 100%, Attack increased by 400%.))
(Wood Form: Defense increased by 100%, additional skill, Wild Growth, throwing out seeds that can rapidly grow.))
(Water Form: Increases Defense by 100%. Additional Skill: Heal.))
(Fire Form: Increases Defense by 100%, Attack Power by 300%, Additional Skill: Scorch.))
(Earth Form: Increases defense by 800%, reduces speed by 60%.))
[Duration: 5 minutes]
[Cooldown time: 2 hours]
It was another extremely perverted and all-rounded skill. It could be used as an offensive offensive skill. The only downside was that the skill’s duration was relatively short.
It seemed that there were no weaklings in the top eight of the individual competition.
In the evening, the few of them returned to the activity room to summarize as usual.
Dong Fang sat down and said, “It’s great, it’s really great. I’m going to fight ten of them tomorrow. ‘”‘
Liu Ziyang patted him and said,” Stop bragging. Today’s missions are all D-rank missions. Starting tomorrow, we’ll be doing C-rank missions. You’re the vanguard. Don’t let others beat you up. ‘”‘
Everyone burst into laughter. The atmosphere today was clearly much better than yesterday. More importantly, this day had strengthened everyone’s tacit understanding and…Friendship.
MO Xiu didn’t say a single word as he watched the crowd chatting away. He just wanted to quietly watch this scene and see how harmonious his team team was.
The Strongest Club was unstoppable. They had completed ten C-rank missions in seven days, a total of 27 missions. There were still eight C-rank missions and three B-rank missions left.
August 14th. Tomorrow was the elimination round for the individual club challenge, so today was a day off.
These days, the bond between the strongest group had deepened. It was easier to form strong friendships in real battles. Even Du Ya, who had always been difficult to get along with, had become friends with others during this period of time.
Liu Ziyang, the host, brought everyone around Yanjing. In the evening, MO Xiu treated everyone to dinner.
When MO Xiu asked what everyone wanted to eat, several people said they wanted to eat hotpot.
It was vetoed by Moxiu. It didn’t matter if it was expensive or not. It didn’t matter if it was delicious or not. As long as it wasn’t hotpot…
On August 15th, the club battle officially began.
The venue for the team battle was the same as the individual battle, on the second floor of the No. 7 training field.
However, the team battle was obviously not as formal as the school battle. It was more like a large-scale gathering.
Selling accessories, selling player information, and even selling the Yanjing University Beauty Rankings.
Out of curiosity, yes, just curiosity, Moxiu went to take a look at the stall of this man who sold the beauty rankings.
When this old man saw someone coming over, he immediately introduced, “Brother, you know your stuff. My beauty ranking is full. The number one sister, Xiao Hong, the number one sister, Xiao Lan, and I also have private photos of the two sisters. Want one?”
MO Xiu felt that it was meaningless and stood up to leave.
The stall owner immediately said,” Brother, don’t go. If you don’t like maturity, I have the Lolita Rankings. There’s a Lolita in our first grade who entered the rankings. It’s Yang Qingzhuo from the support system. I heard that she recognized a kid called MO Xiu as her master. Sigh, what a pity.’”‘
MO Xiu’s face darkened when he heard this.
“Brother, are you not feeling well? Eh? Why do I find you a little familiar? You are… you’re tne Dig one, MO
The stall owner pointed at MO Xiu with a trembling voice..

                    



Chapter 87: The Competition Begins

MO Xiu revealed a harmless smile and said,””l’m sorry, you’ve got the wrong person.”
Just as he was about to leave, the stall owner hugged MO Xiu’s thigh from behind and said,””Brother MO Xiu, I didn’t do it on purpose. Please let me go, I’ll delete Yang Qingzhuo right now.”
“I already said that I’m not MO Xiu.”
“Don’t lie to me. I was blind and didn’t recognize him just now.”
MO Xiu squatted down and said, “So what if I’m MO Xiu? Why are you so afraid of me?”
The stall owner swallowed his saliva and did not dare to speak.
“It’s alright. Tell me about it. I’m very approachable,” said Moxiu.”
The stall owner still didn’t dare to speak. MO Xiu’s eyes narrowed as he shouted,””Speak!”
The stall owner was so frightened that he knelt on the ground and begged,” I’ll say, I’ll say. The whole school is saying that you’re the devil king of chaos. Not only are you strong and ruthless, but you also have a deep background. Even
Liu Ziyang has to call you boss.”
MO Xiu pursed his lips. He didn’t expect his reputation to be like this. Sigh!
Ignoring the stall owner, he turned around and left.
The stall owner sat on the ground for a long time before returning to his stall.
After thinking for a while, he opened his notebook and wrote down a sentence.
“The Great Demon King MO Xiu was angered by the female slave Yang Qingzhuo and beat up an innocent peddseller!”
MO Xiu walked around the venue and discovered that other than third-party vendors, there was also an official gambling house.
The host, the Student Union, was the host. There were many ways to play. The champion bet, the top four bet, the top eight bet, and the top sixteen bet. One could bet on the person they liked to enter the top sixteen, and they could even bet on the champion.
The most common bet was still on the outcome of a single match. However, the match had not started yet, so they did not know the situation of the match. Therefore, there was still an opening for the outcome of a single match.
Right now, only the top 16 could be placed. MO Xiu had originally wanted to bet on himself to enter the top 16, but he was told that he could not bet on himself in the top 16 prediction. He was also not allowed to bet on his match in a single match.
After a simple look, Moxiu felt that there was nothing interesting about it, so he returned to the preparation area.
At this moment, the seven members of the strongest club were all here. Liu Ziyang said,”Boss, the competition is about to start, and you still want to go out and have fun?”
“I’ll go and scout out the enemy’s situation!”
‘ President,” Hao Ren said in disbelief,” Forgive me for being blunt, but you haven’t investigated the enemy.””
Although the venue had not changed, the layout of the venue was still somewhat different from the internal competition.
Moxiu also saw a familiar face among the judges. It was Mu Mu. He didn’t expect Mu Mu to be a member of the student council.
MO Xiu looked at the time. There was still some time before the match, so he went up to greet them.
“Mumu, I didn’t know that you’re a member of the student council and a judge.”
When Mu Mu saw that it was MO Xiu, he said generously, “”No problem, but with your strength, you shouldn’t need my help.”
“Why are you here as a referee?”
“My club is the Vermillion Bird. As you know, the competition is very intense. I didn’t get selected. Since I can’t fight, I might as well be a referee.”
MO Xiu exchanged some pleasantries before returning to his seat.
Towards Mu Mu, MO Xiu had always admired Mu Mu. Mu Mu had a goal and a goal to pursue!
“Hello, everyone! The annual team battle had begun!
“The number of participants this year has set a new record. There are a total of 527 people participating in the solo competition and 74 teams participating in the team competition. I heard from senior that only 15 people participated in the first team competition.”
After a long warm-up, the host explained the rules. The winning and losing rules were the same as the school battles, but the advancement rules were simpler and cruder. It was an elimination round.
From the qualifiers to the finals, it was a one-on-one elimination match.
It wasn’t that the Student Union didn’t want to make the competition more reasonable, but there were simply too many participants, so many that they could only have an elimination round.
The team competition was not like the internal competition, where there were only thirty-two people left in the inter-class competition and the internal competition.
According to the registration rules for the team battle, any official team could sign up. If the number of participants was too limited, the competition would not look good. In addition, there were many teams, so there would naturally be too many participants.
There were more than five hundred participants in total. Even if it was an elimination round, it would still take five rounds to advance to the top sixteen.
The official match began. There were simply too many people, so MO Xiu did not have the chance to go on stage today.
On the first day, Du Ya and Yang Qingzhuo advanced to the second round while Dong Fang and Hao Ren were eliminated. He Lingyue and Liu Ziyang didn’t go on stage like MO Xiu.
The first day had just passed, and the first round hadn’t ended yet. The strongest club had already eliminated two people. This was something that MO Xiu didn’t expect.
Moreover, Dong Fang and Hao Ren were both powerful. As long as they were not unlucky, they should be able to make it to the third or fourth round.
Hao Ren was still alright. He had already figured out his position, and he was better at gathering information than fighting.
Dong Fang could not accept it. It was normal to be eliminated in the inter-school competition, but if he was eliminated in the first round of the team competition, he would be laughed at by the girls who were chasing him. He was quite big, yet he was hugging MO Xiu and crying.
MO Xiu was also helpless and could only console her,”That’s enough. If your goddess really likes you, she must be someone who likes you. If your results aren’t good, continue to work hard. Girls like boys who are motivated.”
MO Xiu didn’t believe it himself, but he had no choice. The key was to get Dong Fang to stop hugging him.
The second day of the individual competition, August 16th.
MO Xiu finally appeared.
Since there were ten groups competing at the same time, the referee was responsible for introducing the contestants. This way, it wouldn’t be too chaotic.
MO Xiu glanced at the referee. It was not Mu Mu, but a tall boy.
The referee said, ” Both parties have entered. Li Yongjie of the Giant Whale Club and MO Xiu of the Strongest Club!”
Li Yongjie laughed as soon as he entered the ring.
“Hahaha, the strongest club? Is this the name of the club? What a joke. How shameless must a person be to come up with such a name?”
“I got the name, so what?” Moxiu said indifferently.”
“You? I only have one flaw. I don’t like people who pretend to be cool. Today, I’ll teach you a lesson.”
MO Xiu asked in surprise, “You don’t know me?””
In MO Xiu’s opinion, not to mention his current reputation as the devil king of chaos, just based on the results of the top eight in the school, Li Yongjie should be able to recognize him. Moreover, they were all first years. Could it be that Li Yongjie was cultivating behind closed doors and did not care about the world?
Li Yongjie was stunned for a moment before he said,””l don’t care who you are. I’m going to beat you up today.”
The referee beside him whispered, “Mo Xiu…” Due to the noise, Li Yongjie did not hear it clearly.
‘What? What did you say?”
MO Xiu glanced at the referee. The referee lowered his head in embarrassment. This Li Yongjie was simply disappointing.
The referee coughed twice to cover up his embarrassment.
“Cough cough, competition…Begin!”
Li Yongjie seemed to realize that something was wrong and asked the referee,”What did you just say?
MO Xiu had already arrived in front of Li Yongjie. “He said…My name is MO Xiu!”
“What happened to MO Xiu? What was that? MO Xiu!”

                    



Chapter 88: Great Demon King (1)

By the time Li Yongjie reacted, it was already too late. He was sent flying by MO Xiu’s kick and landed outside the arena.
The referee looked at Li Yongjie’s position and said,””Mo Xiu wins, he will be promoted to the next round, Li Yongjie will be eliminated.”
Li Yongjie was lying outside the field. His first reaction was to turn around and run.
When Li Yong Jie told outsiders about this matter, he described the thrilling story of his heroic struggle and how he was almost killed by MO Xiu in the end. At this point, the name of Demon King Moxiu was finally established, and it spread to everyone overnight.
When Moxiu heard his own name, he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He was known as the ” Spear God Zhou Qiuwu ” or the ” Hundred Face Goddess Du
Moxiu was the best.’Great Demon King Moxiu’. It sounded like a villain. There was even a parenthesis behind the word’ demon’!
The day of the competition ended. The first round of the competition ended on August 17th and August 18th.
There were still 262 people left in the second round.
The results of the competition were MO Xiu and Liu Ziyang advancing, and He Lingyue eliminated.
The strongest club had four people left for the second round, MO Xiu, Du Ya, Yang Qingzhuo, and Liu Ziyang.
After a few days of observation, MO Xiu discovered that four people had come to the top eight of the school tournament.
Zhou Qiuwu, Du Ya, the dark horse of the ability system, Jeremy, and himself.
Three out of the four were the favorites to win the championship. Only MO Xiu did not have a high chance of winning.
Moxiu was originally a support-type, so he had the lowest chance of entering the top eight of the school tournament. Adding on the fact that he had the character of the Demon King, it was already good enough that he wasn’t being hated by everyone, let alone being supported.
August 19th, the second round of the competition began. MO Xiu didn’t go on stage. Yang Qingzhuo was up against a strong opponent and lost due to his lack of attack power. However, Little Stalker didn’t care. Her creed was team first, and she didn’t care about personal glory.
The eighth month, the twentieth day, the second round of the competition, the second day.
MO Xiu appeared. The other party was a member of a small agility-type club. Seeing that he had bumped into MO Xiu, he did not panic and slowly said,”
“MO Xiu, for you to be able to advance to the top eight of the school tournament, you do have some strength. However, that’s all. You’re the weakest among the top eight.”
MO Xiu didn’t understand. Other people usually started their matches right away, so why was it that the opponents they encountered always had to beat them up first?
“Won’t you know if I’m strong or not after fighting? Come! Let’s begin.”
This person had one hand behind his back and the other in front of his chest. He looked like a transcendent expert.
Don’t be anxious, I haven’t finished my words. I want to fight you, but I can’t help it. Sigh!”
“Ah, this person is so handsome. Facing the Great Demon King MO Xiu, he is actually so calm and composed.”
“Yes, yes, I saw him too. He’s handsome.”
MO Xiu looked around. Someone like this actually had supporters.
Just as he was about to attack, he saw this person take a step back and walk out of the boundary.
“I won’t fight with you today. See you another day!”
With that, he swaggered away.
MO Xiu clutched his head. This was the first time he had seen someone admit defeat so gracefully.
Even the referee did not react in time. It was not until the person walked far away that he stuttered, “Uh, MO Xiu won and advanced to the next round.”
Just like that, MO Xiu inexplicably advanced. He originally thought that there was nothing to see and he would just go home.
However, halfway through, he found a large audience gathered at the side of the arena. After asking, he found out that Zhou Qiuwu and Jeremy had met. In the second round of the qualifiers, two of the favorites had met.
Moxiu squeezed his way to the front row with great difficulty, wanting to see the battle between the two.
Barry was the dark horse of the ability system. During the school’s internal battle, he had killed an assault-type seed before he advanced.
At this moment, the battle between the two of them had reached its climax. This was the first time MO Xiu had seen Zhou Qiuwu not defeat his opponent in one move.
Barrymi and Zhou Qiuwu had two skills. The battle between two cheaters was equivalent to a battle between second graders.
At this moment, Zhou Qiuwu finally brandished his silver spear, but he still did not move.
Barrymie’s appearance was even more stunning. He had a pair of white wings that were more than two meters long on his back. Yellow lasers shot out from his eyes to attack. He flapped his wings and circled in the air like a god.
This was the two skills of Bai Ruimi. One was a powerful skill that Zhou Qiuwu could only block with his spear, and the other was so hard that it could defend against the wings of Zhou Qiuwu’s spear.
Neither of them could do anything to the other. MO Xiu’s expression was solemn. These two were too strong.
Although the situation was evenly matched, everyone knew that Zhou Qiuwu was stronger.
Everyone knew that Zhou Qiuwu had two skills. It was said by a butler that the Zhou family trusted very much. After the news was leaked, the Zhou family severely punished the butler, so it couldn’t be fake. This news also spread to Beijing.
However, the strange thing was that Zhou Qiuwu had never used his second skill. He had always been fighting with his silver spear.
It seemed that Zhou Qiuwu wanted to hide his skill. Even in this situation, he did not want to reveal it easily.
The organizers were also very helpless. These two people had met so early. If one of them was eliminated, they would lose a lot of attention.
In the end, the organizers took advantage of the stalemate between the two to announce a draw.
When the results came out, not only were the audience stunned, but Zhou Qiuwu and Jeremy were also very unhappy. They forced a draw.
Moxiu frowned slightly. The organizers had no principles. There was never a rule in the rules that said a match could be called a draw.
Even if there had been a situation where the two were evenly matched, it would only be at the end when one of them was exhausted and the one who fell first was the loser.
Originally, the organizers wanted to keep the highlight, but this time, it backfired. The audience said that the organizers had a shady deal and deliberately arranged for the two to fight in advance, and then announced a draw to deceive the audience.
Even if the organizers returned all the money they had bet on this match after the game, it would not be able to restore the already bad reputation.
The second round of the qualifiers ended in this farce.
The three people from the strongest club had advanced to the next round: MO Xiu, Liu Ziyang, and Du Ya.
August 20th, third round of the qualifiers, a total of 132 people remained.
The remaining people could finally finish a round in a day.
Moxiu’s opponent was a girl, a submissive little girl.
Seeing this little girl reminded MO Xiu of Ye Qian ‘er, who was currently in her third year of high school.
After the little girl went on stage, she realized that her opponent was MO Xiu. She said somewhat dejectedly, Great Demon King, I can’t beat you.”
“Are you going to admit defeat?” MO Xiu asked.”
“No, I can’t! Even if I can’t beat you, I still want to try. We’ve already fought this round.”
“Then let’s begin?”
“Can I ask you a few questions?”
MO Xiu took a deep breath. What was going on? Why didn’t they have a good fight no matter who they fought?
“Ask! ”
“Is Yang Qingzhuo is really your maid?” she asked, her face red.”
The little girl jumped up excitedly. Then, she looked at Moxiu and started to squirm again.
“I knew it. I made a bet with my friend that you’re not a bad person. Yang
Qingzhuo has been following you all this time, and Liu Ziyang calls you boss.”
Moxiu felt a headache coming on. He already had enough titles. Don’t add any more.. I can’t take it anymore…

                    



Chapter 89: Battlefield

“You still think of me as the Great Demon King, don’t you?” Moxiu said.”
“Why?”
“Let’s begin!”
When the little girl saw that Moxiu was preparing to fight, she did not hold back and immediately activated her skill. It was an Assassin skill.
After activating the skill, the little girl disappeared, but not completely.
It was to use a skill to reduce the sense of existence so that people could not feel her presence.
After Motheo activated his skill, he could see it if he focused.
Once the little girl’s skill lost its effect, things became much simpler. Moxiu directly sent her flying out of bounds with a punch.
The referee announced the result.” MO Xiu wins!”
After Moxiu obtained victory, he turned around and left without even looking at the little girl.
The little girl shouted excitedly behind him, “You’re indeed a domineering
CEO.””
After the competition ended, the remaining three members of the strongest club advanced to the fourth round.
When MO Xiu returned home, what he saw when he entered the house was not hot pot.
MO Xiu wanted to laugh when he saw how Yang Qingzhuo was so busy. “Why did you think of cooking?” asked MO Xiu.”
‘ Of course it’s because I’ve had enough hotpot,” Zheng Yi whispered.” No matter how delicious hotpot is, I can’t stand it anymore!”
Yang Qingzhuo acted as if he didn’t hear Zheng Yi’s words. He blushed and said, “I read in a book that even a mistress has to know how to cook. I’ve been learning for a few days. Today is my first time cooking.”
Zheng Yi immediately beamed with joy and secretly gave MO Xiu a thumbs up.
When MO Xiu heard this, he did not dare to accept it. He could only pick up a piece of unknown food and put it into his mouth.
He chewed it carefully. The taste was really not bad. He did not expect that he would not be a god of food for nothing. He really had some skills.
Zheng Yi was full of praises after tasting it.
“Yang Qingzhuo, your cooking skills are really good. You have transformed from a God of Food to a God of Food.”
Little Fushun, on the other hand, was eating with relish, ignoring everyone.
When Little Fushun’s back was facing Moxiu, the patterns on his back swayed, and Moxiu unconsciously fell into it.
Slowly, the patterns in Moxiu’s eyes began to spin and twist together. The speed became faster and faster, forming a vortex. The vortex gradually slowed down, and finally stopped. The scene unfolded.
In front of MO Xiu was not a dining table or the pattern on Little Fu Shun’s back, but a battlefield.
There was not a single plant on the battlefield. Giant beasts were as tall as dozens of floors, and the skills released by humans were flying all over the sky.
A giant was currently fighting with a giant beast. Blood flowed out, and a blood-curdling scream caused Moxiu to shudder.
Just as Moxiu was lost in his thoughts, he heard a voice in his ear. He couldn’t hear what it was, but he tried his best to listen.
“MO Xiu…Mo Xiu!”
The scene in front of him changed, and he returned to the dining table. Little Fushun had already finished eating and was sleeping soundly on the chair.
“MO Xiu, what’s wrong?” Zheng Yi asked curiously. Why are you suddenly in a daze? You don’t listen to me no matter how I call you.”
MO Xiu placed Little Fu Shun on the table. The little fellow kicked MO Xiu a few times in dissatisfaction after being woken up.
“Look at the patterns on Xiao Fushun’s back, do you see anything?”
Yang Qingzhuo looked at it for a while and said,”There’s nothing. The pattern is quite strange. ‘”‘
MO Xiu looked at Zheng Yi, hoping that Zheng Yi would see something.
However, Zheng Yi blinked and said, “Mo Xiu, are you crazy? My eyes are going blind, but I can’t see anything? What did you see just now?”
“A battlefield, a very strange battlefield. I feel like I’m in it.”
Zheng Yi understood that MO Xiu would not joke around with the others.
After looking carefully again, he said, “I still don’t see anything, but according to what you said, you seem to have been hit by an illusion.”‘
“Illusion?”
” That’s right.” Zheng Yi nodded and said,” I heard from my dad that some people’s skills are illusions. They let others see some strange things. Little Fushun is a wild beast. Could it be that his talent is illusions?” Did I accidentally use it on you?”
MO Xiu looked at Little Fu Shun and said,”ls that so?””
Little Fu Shun was a little confused. He looked back and forth at these people, as if he didn’t understand what they were talking about.
MO Xiu stared at Little Fu Shun’s back for a while, but he didn’t enter that strange state again.
Now. it seemed that Zheng Yi’s analysis was the most likely-
However, Moxiu was still thinking about the scene he had just seen. He felt as if he had seen it somewhere before, but he could not remember.
MO Xiu couldn’t figure it out and his head hurt a little. He shook his head. Sigh! He didn’t want to think about it anymore.
Back in his room, MO Xiu lay on the bed. He remembered that he had not contacted Mu Qingyi for a long time and quickly made a call.
“Hello? You still know how to call me?”
“What about me?” Moxiu asked softly.”
“Didn’t you say that there was nothing wrong with the girl named Yang Qingzhuo? Why are you cohabiting?”
Mu Qingyi knew about it again? MO Xiu even suspected that Mu Qingyi had installed a camera on him. How did she know everything?
“Are you jealous?”
“Don’t give me that. I was fooled by you last time.”
“There’s nothing between us. Zheng Yi lives with me too. If you don’t believe me, you can ask him.”
“I’m not asking. It has nothing to do with me. Hmph!”
“Qingyi!”
“Hmm?” “How have you been recently?”
“Still… Not bad!”
“Not doing well, is it? I’m talking about you!
“Hmm… Alright, I still have something to do. I’ll hang up first. Let’s talk another day!”
“Alright then!” “Sigh! MO Xiu!” “What’s wrong?” “I miss you. Bye!”
“Beep, beep, beep…”
Before Moxiu could finish speaking, the other party had already hung up.
He knew that Mu Qingyi was not doing well, but he was helpless at this moment. Sigh! He was still not strong enough!
August 21st, the fourth round of the preliminaries. There were still 64 contestants.
Moxiu’s opponent in the fourth round was a boy named Milo, from the Kingdom of Dawn, one of the six major clubs.
It was already the fourth round, and the people who advanced weren’t weak. MO Xiu didn’t let his guard down and released God’s Sight.
” Skill 1: Ferocious Tiger Summoning 2
[Skill effect: Summons two energy tigers. All attributes of the tigers are 120% of the caster’s.]
[Second form: The two tigers combine into one, and their attributes become
200% of the caster’s.] [Duration: 10 minutes]
[Cooldown time: 2 hours]
This was the first time Moxiu had encountered a summoning skill. It should belong to the Esper class, right? The attributes were 120% of the caster’s, but they could still be dealt with.
The host announced the start of the match. Milo immediately released his skill and summoned two fierce tigers.
Moxiu didn’t use any skills at first, thinking that he could deal with the two tigers without using any skills.
However, when it came to a real battle, it was not the case. Although the tiger’s attributes were not particularly strong, its flexibility was not something that humans could compare to.
Without using any skills, Moxiu found it very difficult to deal with these two tigers.
MO Xiu didn’t dare to delay and immediately activated the Descent of the War God. Golden light flashed beneath his feet, and he immediately became more at ease.
However, the fight between the two tigers was still a little annoying. Milo was also a decisive person. Seeing that the two tigers were no threat to Motheo, he immediately activated his second form and combined the two tigers into one, turning them into an even bigger tiger.
Moxiu faintly smiled as he thought to himself, I was waiting for this moment..’

                    



Chapter 90: Top 16

When they were two tigers, they could still fight with Moxiu. After fusing into one tiger, although their combat strength soared, they could no longer block Moxiu’s path.
Moxiu didn’t care about the tiger at all and went straight for Milo. The weakness of the summoning skill was the main body.
Moxiu instantly closed in on Milo. Milo had no choice but to fight.
However, Milo was no match for Moxiu and was defeated in a few moves.
Milo was a tough guy. He didn’t give up. He gritted his teeth and endured a few punches from Moxiu, waiting for the tiger to arrive.
However, Moxiu didn’t give him a chance. He knocked him out with a hand chop, and the tiger behind him disappeared.
The referee announced the result.
“MO Xiu wins and advances to the top 32.”
MO Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. They were in the top 32. There was only one match left before they could advance to the top 16.
The club battle was different from the school battle. The top sixteen was chosen instead of the top eight.
After that, MO Xiu watched the match between Du Ya and Liu Ziyang. The two of them actually met.
Liu Ziyang felt very unlucky. He had encountered a seeded player in the school battle, and this time, he had encountered Du Ya.
However, Liu Ziyang had improved greatly during this period of time. The afterimages of the two skills could not be underestimated, forcing Du Ya to use her full strength.
Moxiu did a rough count. Du Ya had switched her armor form eleven times in this match. This was enough to prove how much trouble Liu Ziyang had brought to her.
When the match was over, Du Ya deliberately kicked Liu Ziyang’s stomach twice.
He left behind a sentence.” Why didn’t you admit defeat? I’m so tired!” August 22nd, the final round of the qualifiers.
MO Xiu bumped into an old acquaintance, He Xu, who was in a rage tornado.
He Xu thought to himself that he was unlucky to meet MO Xiu again.
MO Xiu was not in a hurry this time. Seeing that He Xu wanted to admit defeat, he hurriedly said,”Don’t admit defeat yet. Let’s talk.”
He Xu shook his head and said, “I have nothing to talk about with you!!”‘
“Don’t. Are you interested in joining my club? The treatment was not bad, and there was no need to go through the selection process to qualify for the competition.”
“No need, my club is very good now!”
“Come on, I’ll give you a salary. Other clubs don’t have salaries.”
MO Xiu valued He Xu’s skill very much. It was equivalent to a large-scale crowd control skill.
However, no matter what MO Xiu said, He Xu remained indifferent.
He Xu turned around and walked out of the arena. MO Xiu followed him and chased after He Xu.
The referee was stunned. Wasn’t this too natural? Poaching people on the spot?
The referee scratched his head. Who won? He Xu was the one who walked over first, right? Cough cough! MO Xiu wins and advances to the top 16!”
MO Xiu chased him all the way to the entrance of the stadium. Seeing that He Xu was still unmoved, he could only give up.
After returning to the stadium to watch the match, Du Ya had successfully advanced to the next round.
In the top 16, two members of the Azure Dragon Club, three members of the White Tiger Club, three members of the Vermilion Bird Club, two members of the Black Tortoise Club, two members of the Yanjing Club, and two members of the Dawn Club advanced.
The six major clubs had fourteen members. What was different from the past was that one club had suddenly emerged and was on par with the six major clubs, at least in the first year group.
That was the strongest club that had been reduced to a laughingstock at the start. No one had expected that a small club with only seven members would actually have two people advance to the top sixteen. These two people had even entered the top eight of the inter-school tournament at the same time.
Everyone began to look at the strongest clubs, including the six major clubs.
When the strongest club gained strength, their name would no longer be a joke, but a resounding signboard!
Even the organizers had taken the initiative to look for Moxiu and seek cooperation with the strongest club. Of course, Moxiu didn’t have the time to push it to Hao Ren, the vice president.
Hao Ren was now helping the strongest club collect intelligence and organize information. He was in charge of all the club matters, and compared to MO Xiu, Hao Ren was more like the president of the strongest club.
The results of the solo competition had greatly strengthened the confidence of the seven members of the club. Du Ya now completely believed that the strongest club had the strength to fight in the team battle.
August 23rd. The Strongest Society continued their mission of extermination under Moxiu’s leadership.
Everyone in the club was full of confidence. All these changes in their hearts were very magical.
When the club was first established, everyone had been forcefully pulled in by Moxiu. Later on, when they were signing up, they felt that this was actually not bad. At least, it saved them the time needed for the selection within the club.
Now, everyone was full of confidence in this team and was glad to be able to join such a club.
August 26th, the remaining eight C-rank missions were all completed. The next step was the B-rank mission.
Before the B-rank mission, everyone had done a lot of preparation work to ensure that nothing went wrong.
On August 29th, he needed to return to the department to prepare for the team battle.
Therefore, they only had one day to complete the mission.
August 28th, expedition!
Target: Montenegro Gang of Four.
There were only four people in this small organization, but each of them was very powerful and had a reputation in that area.
Before they set off, in the activity room.
Only Moxiu and Hao Ren were left to make the final preparations. Hao Ren stared at the phone in a daze as if he had seen something scary. “Hao Ren, what’s wrong?” asked MO Xiu. Are you scared?”
Hao Ren handed the phone to Moxiu. After taking the phone, the smile on Moxiu’s face instantly disappeared, and his expression turned serious.
Gunshots!
Appearing in the campus of Yanjing University!
The photo showed a girl lying on the ground with a bloody hole in the back of her head. It looked like she had been ambushed.
The situation had developed too quickly and was becoming more and more serious. Moxiu understood that the matter of firearms should have already alarmed the upper echelons of the various factions.
“When did this happen?” asked MO Xiu. I want detailed information on this matter.”
“Last night, the news was blocked, but there were still photos that leaked out.
I’ll investigate now!”
At this moment, Liu Ziyang came in and said,”Boss!” Why haven’t we set off yet?”
“Tell everyone to cancel todays mission and rest for a day. After the school team battle is over, we’ll go wipe out the four-man team.”
MO Xiu was not someone who would go back on his word. There must be something important that Liu Ziyang did as he was told.
After the others left, Yang Qingzhuo returned to the activity room to wait for Mo Xiu.
Hao Ren was contacting MO Xiu while he waited anxiously.
Yang Qingzhuo looked around, not knowing what was going on.
Hao Ren suddenly looked up and said,”l got it!””
MO Xiu slammed the table and said,”Hurry up and say it!””
“It happened at the school gate, so even if the news was blocked in time, many people saw it.”
“The school gate? Does that mean the murderer has been seen?”
“That’s right!” Hao Ren looked at his phone again. The time of the crime was in the early morning. There were not many people at that time. The murderer was caught this morning. He was not a student of Yanjing University.” “Do you have any information about this girl?”
“There’s nothing special about second-year students of the elemental department, so there’s not much information that can be found.”
There was nothing in common between this case and the Qingyun University case. What was going on?
“What happened after that?”
“I can’t find out. The rest are classified.”
“Then do you know who caught the murderer?” Moxiu asked with a frown. Where is the murderer now?
“I only know that she was captured by the school. I don’t know where she is now.”
School? Cao Fenglin definitely knew.
MO Xiu immediately ran out of the door.
“Wait for me here!”

                    



Chapter 91: Lock

MO Xiu rushed to Cao Fenglin’s office.
The moment they entered, Cao Fenglin gestured for MO Xiu to sit down.
“I know why you’re here!”
“What happened this time?” asked MO Xiu.”
Cao Fenglin’s attitude had changed drastically compared to the last time. He patiently explained to Moxiu.
“The situation at the crime scene is like this. The murderer and the victim had an argument at the school gate. After the argument, the victim turned around and walked into the school.”
“The cause and effect is that the two of them have emotional entanglements.
This is the same as the case at Qingyun University.”
“I want to know where the gun came from!” Moxiu asked.”
“The murderer is a rich kid. He bought it at another gathering.”
“The person who sold the gun?”
“The organization that sold guns was destroyed last night. All of them claimed that the guns fell from the sky.”
MO Xiu frowned. What was going on?
“Teacher Cao, are you still not willing to investigate with me? The situation is very serious now. At least tell me what you know!”
Cao Fenglin was obviously hesitant, but he still rejected,””l’m sorry, I can’t help you!”
“Aren’t you afraid that your family and friends will be in danger?”
“I said I’ll help you, but I can’t. I advise you not to get involved in this matter.”
“Teacher!”
“Alright! “I didn’t let you interfere before because our levels weren’t high enough to find out the truth. Now, I don’t let you interfere because we don’t need to interfere anymore.”
Cao Fenglin threw a map to Moxiu. Moxiu took it and saw that there were more than ten circles drawn on it.
“Is this the map of Yanjing?
Cao Fenglin closed his eyes and said,” That’s right. This is the map of Yanjing.
All the places that have been circled have been killed by firearms.’”‘
MO Xiu stared at Cao Fenglin in disbelief. He didn’t expect things to have developed to this extent.
“Do you know the reason now? ” Including the one that happened on the campus of Yanjing University yesterday, there are a total of 18 murders. You don’t know this, but because the news has been blocked, not only the school, but also the law enforcement team, the military, and the Shadow team above level 6 have all been dispatched to investigate this matter. You…” The energy is too small!”
Moxiu fell into deep thought. He had not expected that the little clue he had discovered would actually develop to such an extent in a month’s time.
MO Xiu didn’t want to give up. No matter how many people went to investigate, he had to do his part.
“Teacher, do you know the progress of the investigation?”
Cao Fenglin said in exasperation, ” Oh you, why didn’t you listen to my advice?
Now, we can confirm that all the firearms fell from the sky. As for who threw them, we don’t know.””
All the clues stopped at this point. Moxiu stood up and bid farewell to Cao Fenglin, preparing to leave.
MO Xiu did not blame Cao Fenglin for not helping. It was obvious that he was also trying his best to gather clues.
“Wait!”
“What’s wrong?” MO Xiu turned around and asked. Teacher Cao!”
Cao Fenglin sighed. I can’t help you with anything else, but I can tell you what
I’ve learned.”
“I’m all ears!”
“Why did the emergence of firearms increase the crime rate?”
Moxiu replied without hesitation,” Because firearms are powerful and easy to use. “”
“What you said is the reason on the surface. The fundamental reason is the bestial nature and desire of humans!”
MO Xiu didn’t say anything and listened attentively.
“Perhaps many people have firearms, but there are only two kinds of people who commit crimes. One is the rich. They have something they can’t get and want to use violence to solve it. This is represented by the two school shooting incidents. The other is the bottom class.”
“People who are slightly rich have more desires than bestiality. They are afraid of the rules, so they often commit premeditated crimes.”
“People at the bottom of the society who have been suppressed for a long time will suddenly explode. Their bestial nature is greater than their desires.” “What is desire? What is bestial nature?”
“There is something that can allow you to do things that you couldn’t do before, but this thing violates the rules, and you still accept it. This is the desire that I mentioned before.”
“There is something that can make you completely explode. You don’t have to swallow your anger anymore. You can do whatever you want. The consequence is self-destruction.”
“Then what should we do?” Moxiu asked, seeming to understand.”
Cao Fenglin said,” Desire and bestial nature can only be hidden. They won’t disappear. We can only lock them up and ban firearms. But now…lt was opened.”
“Then we should find the mastermind and lock it again!”
“MO Xiu, you are very smart, even smarter than me. However, what you lack now is a structure. The structure is too small..
“What do you mean?”
“Not to mention that we don’t have any clues now. We can’t find the mastermind, which means that we can’t eliminate the root cause. Just based on the current situation, who knows how many people in the entire Alliance have hidden firearms.’
Moxiu fell silent. That’s right, things had already reached this stage. It would be very difficult to control them.
“The last time we banned firearms, it took ten years. At that time, the background was that there were wild beasts eyeing us covetously, and the people were united.”
“Do you think this firearm was thrown by a wild beast, Mr. Cao?” asked MO Xiu. You want to disintegrate us from the inside?”
“There’s a possibility, but it’s not very likely. I’m more inclined to believe that it was done by a human. This person usually places the firearms in poor areas or at rich businessmen’s banquets. This way, he can quickly digest the firearms and won’t spread it to the law enforcement team. This person understands people better than you and me…”
MO Xiu walked out of the office, feeling dizzy.
The structure? Human heart? It seems like I was still too naive.
As Moxiu walked, he took out his phone and opened the Shadow app. He realized that the mission to investigate firearms that he had previously created had disappeared.
When he looked at the main page again, he realized that the matter had blown up. There was a pinned mission on Shadow’s main page.
“Investigation Mission: Source of the firearms (Unlimited number of times, multiple people and teams can accept the mission.)
[Mission Level: SSS]
[Mission details: Recently, within the Alliance, there have been incidents of people being injured by firearms in many cities. Please check the relevant forums on the main page for details.] [Completion Condition: Find the source of the firearms.]
[ [Mission reward: 10 billion points]
Shadow had also issued a quest, which showed how much importance the Alliance placed on this matter.
Moxiu opened the forum to check. In the entire Alliance, there were 43 cities that were hit by firearms, and Yanjing was the most serious.
MO Xiu looked around. Shun City was one of the 43 cities, but it was not serious. There was only one case.
He was still worried, so he called his mother, Li Yuan, to ask about the situation.
After receiving the news that his mother was safe and sound, he gave Yue Yuan a call and asked him to send some people to protect his mother during this period of time. Only then did he feel at ease.
On August 29th, August 30th, and August 31st, the first and second teams of the support department conducted training to prepare for the team battle in the school.
During this period of time, Cleansing Eyes had improved again. Whether it was his analysis of the battle or his understanding of Skills, he had improved by a level, benefiting everyone greatly.
Mu Mu only said lightly, “Let’s improve together! ‘”‘

                    



Chapter 92: Team Battle

On September 1st, the much-anticipated team competition began. Compared to the individual competition, the team competition was more enjoyable to watch.
There were four teams from the power attack system and the elemental system, three teams from the agility system and the ability system, and two teams from the support system. There were a total of sixteen teams, and the top four teams were selected in the preliminaries.
The competition process was the exact opposite of the individual competition. To ensure fairness, the preliminaries were a knockout system. After the top four were selected, the four teams would take turns to fight. In the end, the team with the most points would win.
The rule was that each Element would have a seeded team, and the seeded teams would not meet.
However, since there were a total of five faculties, in order to select the top four, one of the seeded teams would definitely be eliminated. Therefore, the school stipulated that the last two teams in the previous year would meet.
This kind of competition mechanism was equivalent to sending the seeded team out. It was very rare for the second team of the other departments to advance unexpectedly.
Moreover, this mechanism made it very difficult for the last person to make a comeback, especially for the support system.
Last place this year, and they would have to face other seeded teams in the preliminaries next year. The combat strength of the support system was weak to begin with, and it was almost impossible for them to advance. This was a
vicious cycle.
Therefore, ever since the inter-school competition, the support system had never entered the finals. They had always been stuck in the top four.
After hearing the rules, everyone was a little disappointed. It was fine against other types, but this time it was against the Esper type!
This year, there were many talents in the ability department. Three people had entered the top eight in the individual competition. According to the predictions of the outside world, the ability department had a higher chance of winning than the support department.
MO Xiu also felt great pressure, and he couldn’t help but look at Xiao Lan.
Xiao Lan was definitely the key to this match. As long as Xiao Lan brought out her fighting spirit and displayed her full strength, MO Xiu believed that she would be on par with him.
“Everyone, the team competition has begun! The team competition wasn’t just about individual strength. More importantly, it was about the team’s tenacity, the tacit understanding between the members, and everyone’s contribution.” “Next, let us invite the various participating teams to enter the arena…”
Following the host’s introduction, all 16 teams entered the arena. Following that, the battle list appeared.
Apart from the Support and Esper seed teams, the other teams were completely random.
The luck of the support system was not bad. They encountered the fourth team of the power attack system, but in the next round, they would have to fight against the seed team of the ability system.
The competition venue was a four-in-one arena in the middle. There was only one arena.
Since there was only one group of matches each time, the first round of sixteen to eight was divided into two days.
MO Xiu’s support-type seeded team was the last to go on stage. These two days also gave everyone time to observe their opponents.
The main opponents were of course the other four seeded teams. Throughout the entire round, each team had their own characteristics.
Mu Mu was taking notes quickly, trying to record every detail.
Especially when it came to the special ability seed team, Mu Mu even remembered every little action of the team members.
Assault system, there was nothing much to say. They were very strong individually, and there was no strategy in battle. They directly charged forward and after two rounds, the other party would be disarmed.
Agility-type, this was the team with the best coordination. They perfectly integrated the advantages of speed and flexibility into their tactics. The small coordination between two people and the combined attacks between five people were all very smooth.
The Elemental Element was a rogue Element. Duya stood at the top and used the Earth Armor to shield the people behind her.
The four people behind him each threw a skill. The match was over! There was no reason to reason with them. They could only rely on elemental skills that dealt explosive damage to defeat you.
Finally, it was the Esper class. Their opponents were the Agility class second team, which was ranked in the top two of the second team. Mu Mu, MO Xiu, and the others had thought that this match would be a great reference. They didn’t expect the Esper team to make such a shocking move, leaving the audience dumbfounded.
The match had just started, and two players jumped out of the arena. This was equivalent to giving up two players to the opponent. It was a three-on-five situation.
How was this confidence? He was simply arrogant.
Of course, the audience didn’t think that this matter was too big. They shouted crazily. The five members of the Agility System Team Two gritted their teeth. They didn’t want to suffer such humiliation.
One of the team members said, “Captain, they…” This is humiliating us!”
The captain was very calm at this moment and said, “No, I can’t! They just didn’t want the support system team to see their true strength, but… “The third party will benefit from the fight between the snipe and the clam. This is also our opportunity. As long as we seize this opportunity, we might be able to enter the top four!”
The three Esper contestants were unmoved. They didn’t show any disdain or arrogance. They were very calm.
MO Xiu knew that Espers were very scary. Every member of his team was well-trained.
“Let the competition begin!”
The match ended in just five minutes. The Esper class won. This result was not unexpected, but the process was too terrifying. Three people were beating five people, and the player with two skills had yet to make a move. This was simply too terrifying…
At this moment, the agility-type second team member who had fallen on the field said to the captain,”Captain! Didn’t you say that this was our chance?”
“And you said I can’t be humiliated?” The captain pursed his lips. Why was he the first one to fall to the ground?”
Barry, who was on par with Zhou Qiuwu, had just stepped out of bounds and forfeited. Seeing that the outcome of the match was decided, he immediately looked over to the Support and exchanged glances with Moxiu.
This glance was not avoided, and the provocation was obvious.
Dong Fang, who was sitting at the side, was furious. He shouted, “What are you looking at? Are you not convinced?”
MO Xiu hurriedly covered his face. This Dong Fang had never disappointed anyone. He was really embarrassed.
With a wicked smile, he shouted, “”l’m really not convinced. Let’s have a competition in the next match. The support system isn’t strong, but it’s quite domineering. ”
It was unknown whether these words were a response to the Dong Fang or a mockery of the Demon King MO Xiu. However, there was no time to continue arguing because the support team was about to enter the arena.
MO Xiu looked at his opponents today. Power attack system team four. Even if the power attack system had many talents, team four wouldn’t be particularly strong.
He might as well use God’s Snooping on Jeremy and the person beside him. He could not afford to lose in the next match. If he were to spy on them again, he would only know the skills of the two people.
Only by spying on them multiple times would MO Xiuyi be able to learn all five of their skills.
The first was Jeremy’s skill.
” Skill 1: Explosive Laser 2 [Skill effect: Both eyes shoot out light with a burning effect.]
[Duration: 10 minutes]
[Cooldown: 2 hours]
[Second Skill: Silver Wings Protection (2)]
[Skill Effect: Wings grow on the back. The defense of the silver wings is 800% of the user’s own. It can be freely controlled and has the ability to fly.]
[Duration: 15 minutes]
[Cooldown time: 3 hours]
Barry’s two skills weren’t top-notch, but when they were combined, they were perfect for both offense and defense. This could be seen from his previous fight with Zhou Qiu.
Next was the second person, the dark horse who had always kept a low profile.
” Skill 1: Life Connection 2
[Skill effect: Choose two targets to connect their lives. When one target is injured, the other target will receive 50% of the damage.]
[Duration: 5 minutes] [Cooldown: 1 hour]
[Second Skill: Deceive the crowd]
[Skill Effect: Releases a command to interfere with the actions of up to five targets.]
[Cooldown time: 3 hours]
MO Xiu narrowed his eyes.. This…lt was a little troublesome!

                    



Chapter 93: Prepare for War (1)

The last match of this round was the support system team one versus the power attack system team four.
MO Xiu, Xiao Lan, He Ling, Yue, Yang Qingzhuo, Hu Xianming, as the starting player, were ready to appear.
Just as he was about to go on stage, he was stopped by Mu Mu.
Mu Mu gathered everyone and said,””lt’s best that we preserve some of our strength. Don’t let the other side see our strongest strength.”
“Alright, you make the arrangements,” replied Moxiu as the captain.”
“Today’s lineup is MO Xiu, Xiao Lan, Dong Fang, Xue Ling ‘er, and Jia Haiyang.” Mu Mu replaced He Lingyue, Yang Qingzhuo, and Hu Xianming.
Before they could ask, Mu Mu explained, “”1 made this arrangement because I considered two points. One is that we cannot underestimate the enemy. We will leave Moxiu and Xiao Lan on the field to ensure that there will be no accidents in the competition. ”
“The other thing is, as you can see, the person leading the team from the ability department is very powerful. I’m ashamed that I’m inferior to him. This person must have collected a large amount of information on MO Xiu and Xiao Lan long ago. There’s no need to hide it anymore.”
This time, not only did Mu Mu gain Cao Fenglin’s trust, but she also gained the support of the support department’s dean. This time, she was fully in charge of leading the team.
This opportunity brought Mu Mu power and pressure.
The ability users had indeed used all their tricks in this competition, which made Mu Mu feel very pressured.
The host had already introduced the two teams, and the two teams began to take the stage.
Up until the stage, MO Xiu and the others didn’t discuss their tactics. When they reached the stage, Dong Fang asked, “”Moxiu, how are we going to fight later?”
MO Xiu looked back at his team members and said, ‘”‘There are no tactics. Just fight directly. ”
“Let the competition begin!”
The Assault System began to set up their formation. MO Xiu waved his hand and said,’Go!”
The five support-type players all released their skills and charged forward.
Seeing this, the five assault-type players immediately got into a defensive formation to fight the enemy.
The audience discussed animatedly.
“D * mn, did I see wrongly? The support system initiated an attack? The power attack system is forced to defend?”
“That’s right, isn’t this the opposite?”
‘What do you know? The support system is different. Xiao Lan is Senior Sister Xiao Hong’s sister and is very strong. And that demon king, don’t look down on him. He’s quite strong. He challenged the top eight in the school and the top sixteen in the club.”
The crowd was abuzz with discussion. The storm rose again. The offensive system’s formation was instantly scattered by MO Xiu and Xiao Lan’s two offensive points. The rest of the support system rushed forward.
In less than ten minutes, there was only one person left in the offensive system.
“Should I throw you out, or do you want to go out yourself?” MO Xiu looked at the person and asked.”
This person said with a look that said,’”‘l won’t give up easily.”
“Aiya, f * ck! Stop pretending.”
“Come down!”
“There’s no hope. You want to fight five people alone?”
“No chance!”
The person on the stage shouted to the audience, “You bunch of gutless guys, how dare you affect morale. ‘”‘
Dong Fang didn’t want to listen to their chatter and kicked this person out of the arena.
“Go to hell!”
The host announced the results, “Support System Team One has won and advanced! The next round of the competition was on September 4th.”
After two days of competition, they would rest for a day. On September 4th, they would be facing the first team of the ability department.
After the match and the host’s explanation, God’s Sight had finished its cooldown and could be used again.
Moxiu looked at the Esper class and released his skill to read the skills of the two members.
‘ Skill 1: Painting the Earth as a Prison 3
[Skill effect: Draw a circle on the ground with your feet. All targets within the circle cannot leave the circle.] (Maximum diameter of the circle is 10 meters)
[Duration: 1 minute] [Cooldown time: 20 minutes]
‘ Skill 1: Petrification 3
[Skill Effect: Choose a target and petrify it. The petrified person’s defense will be increased by 500%, and its speed will be reduced to zero.]
[Duration: 3 seconds]
[Cooldown time: 3 minutes]
Both of them had crowd-control skills, which made the tactics of the Esper class very variable.
However, based on the current situation, it was basically certain that Jeremy was the main point of attack.
Seeing that Motheo was looking in their direction, Barrymie extended his right thumb, first pointing up, then slowly turning it down.
Even with such provocation, Moxiu was still not angered. He responded with a smile.
September 3rd was a day off. Mu Mu did not want to waste this precious day, so he gathered the first and second teams of the support system to carry out special training before the competition.
Of course, the second team of the support system had already been eliminated. This time, they were mainly used as sparring partners.
Mu Mu laid out the detailed strategy and asked every team member to follow the established plan.
However, the results of the first round were not ideal. Everyone had their own habits, and there were always unexpected situations. It was difficult to complete the battle according to Mu Mu’s strategy.
Mumu fell into deep thought. In this situation, he could only practice constantly, but there was not enough time. The competition would be held tomorrow.
Just as Mu Mu was troubled, MO Xiu sat beside Mu Mu.
Mu Mu saw that it was MO Xiu and forced a smile.””Moxiu, why don’t you rest for a while? I’ll think about what to do.”
“Do you know?” asked Moxiu. You’re putting too much pressure on yourself.”
Mu Mu sighed and said,” There’s no other way. The support system has given me so much power and trust. I can’t let them down.””
“Then you’re oppressing us?”
Mu Mu tilted her head and asked in confusion,”l’m not oppressing you. I’m oppressing myself.’”‘
“Do you think I’m powerful?”
Mu Mu didn’t understand why MO Xiu asked this, but he still replied, “Of course it’s powerful!”
“Then what do you think is amazing about me?”
“Your skills, your physical fitness, your improvisation…You mean…”
“That’s right. Why do you want us to follow your fixed strategy? Is it because you don’t trust me or because you don’t trust everyone?”
Mu Mu lowered his head and said,” Neither. I just think that this tactic is the best. It has the best chance of defeating the ability system. ‘”‘
‘We’ve been training together for so long. We have a tacit understanding. Don’t you believe in our performance on the field?” If the opponent didn’t use the tactics you predicted, would our tactics be useless? At that time, we will only be flustered.’
“What you said makes sense. I do have a problem. How about this, I’ll design two more tactics.”
“That’s not what I meant…” Moxiu said helplessly.
At some point, Cao Fenglin entered and walked to Mumu’s side.
He gently patted Mu Mu’s shoulder and said,””Take a rest first. Leave the rest to me.”
Mu Mu said unwillingly,” But, there are still many things that I haven’t told you. The opponent’s habitual attack route, the problem that we should avoid. ‘”‘ Cao Fenglin said gently,” I said, let me do it. You’re too tired.’”‘
Mu Mu still wanted to say something, but he didn’t say it in the end. He knew that he was in a bad mood and was a little impatient.
Cao Fenglin asked Mu Mu to sit at the side and personally directed the training.
“Everyone listen up, the second team is dismissed and the first team is to gather. We will change the training method for the following training and will not continue with the team battle.”
The second team left the arena, leaving only the first team of eight people, waiting for Cao Fenglin’s next instructions.
“Xiao Lan and Yang Qingzhuo, MO Xiu and Hu Xianming, two against two!”

                    



Chapter 94: Xiao Hong (1)

MO Xiu and the others were a little confused. Weren’t they preparing for tomorrow’s team battle? Why was it a two-on-two?
Cao Fenglin saw that they didn’t move and shouted, ‘”What’s wrong? I haven’t taught you guys for the past few days, so you don’t listen to me anymore?” MO Xiu and the others could only do as Cao Fenglin said.
Yang Qingzhuo was a little reluctant. He wanted to be in the same group as MO Xiu, but after MO Xiu’s persuasion, he decided to cooperate with the training.
Since they were going to fight, they had to fight seriously. MO Xiu and the others were very serious, and they fought fiercely from the beginning.
Just as the four of them were locked in battle, Cao Fenglin suddenly shouted,” Stop!
The four of them immediately stopped and looked at Cao Fenglin in confusion.
Cao Fenglin turned to Mu Mu, who was sitting at the side, and said,””When MO Xiu attacked, how should Xiao Lan and Yang Qingzhuo cooperate to resolve the situation?”
Mu Mu was also confused, but he still gave an answer.
Cao Fenglin said,” That’s right. Do you remember it?”” Xiao Lan and Yang Qingzhuo nodded.
“Alright, if you remember, the competition will continue!”
After that, it wasn’t just 2v2, there were also 3v3 and 4v4. When there wasn’t enough manpower, Mu Mu even went up.
Cao Fenglin asked Mu Mu to design many combinations according to the situation.
That’s right, it was cooperation, not tactics. It was cooperation between two people, three people, four people, but there was no complete set of tactics.
Moxiu slowly understood Cao Fenglin’s intentions. He wanted to train everyone’s tacit understanding when they fought together. He wanted to sort out all the possible combinations that might occur. After that, he would leave the matters on the battlefield to the members to handle.
It’s a little like that. I’ll leave the moves to you. When the time comes, how you use them will depend on yourself.
After a day of training, Cao Fenglin dismissed everyone except for Mu Mu.
“Is this really okay?” Mu Mu asked worriedly. Is it safe without a fixed strategy?”
Cao Fenglin smiled confidently.” You don’t believe in your team member, MO Xiu. He might be the one with the strongest adaptability in the entire school. I’m talking about the entire school, including the fourth-year students and teachers. Do you understand how big of an advantage this is?”
Mu Mu stared in shock at the direction where MO Xiu had left. He didn’t expect Cao Fenglin to have such a high evaluation of MO Xiu.
“I understand!”
“You have to learn to trust your team members. They have been training together for a long time and have developed a tacit understanding. Everyone is subconsciously cooperating with Moxiu, and Moxiu’s adaptability is so strong.”
Mu Mu said dejectedly,”But I always wanted to do more. Maybe it would be more helpful to this team.””
Cao Fenglin said firmly,” A good mentor doesn’t have to control the team to develop in a certain direction. Instead, he has to stimulate their full potential and become a stronger team.”
Mu Mu’s eyes gradually regained his confidence. He was full of confidence for tomorrow’s match.
Seeing that Mu Mu had returned to normal, Cao Fenglin smiled cheekily and said,””ls it done? Alright, give me a kiss!”
“Get lost! ”
MO Xiu and the others walked out of the stadium and prepared to go to the cafeteria for a meal.
When she reached the entrance of the canteen, Xiao Lan was a little strange and dodged.
MO Xiu turned around and realized that Xiao Hong was right behind them. But why was Xiao Lan hiding from Xiao Hong? Aren’t they sisters?
Strangely enough, MO Xiu had only met Xiao Hong a few times, and all of them were in the cafeteria.
MO Xiu used his eyes to ask Xiao Lan if she wanted to greet Xiao Hong.
Xiao Lan lowered her head slightly and shook her head unnoticeably.
At this moment, Xiao Hong’s voice sounded.
“Xiao Lan, how long are you going to hide from me?”
Xiao Lan saw that there was no longer any need to hide, and walked out from the crowd.
“Sis, I’m not hiding from you.”
Xiao Hong snorted coldly. Don’t give me that. From tomorrow onwards, you’re not allowed to stay in the dormitory anymore.”
Xiao Lan appeared a little listless. It was obvious that she was very unwilling.
Xiao Hong looked at MO Xiu and the others behind Xiao Lan.
“I told you to sign up for the elemental system, but you didn’t listen. Now, you’re with this bunch of trash. And you, you can’t even enter the top eight in the school tournament.”
Xiao Lan could only say softly,”l’m sorry, Sis.””
Dong Fang didn’t know Xiao Hong. When he heard someone call him trash, he immediately replied,””Who are you calling trash?”
Xiao Hong glanced at him, but Dong Fang still looked back at her indignantly.
MO Xiu hurriedly whispered into Dong Fang’s ear,””She is the famous Xiao Hong. ”
Upon hearing that it was Xiao Hong, Dong Fang immediately softened and lowered his head, not daring to look at her.
Although MO Xiu felt that he shouldn’t interfere in other people’s family affairs, he felt that Xiao Hong had gone overboard. Xiao Lan was, after all, his sister.
“Senior Sister Xiao Hong, we were just about to go have a meal. Do you want to join us?” MO Xiu cupped his fists and said.”
Xiao Hong glanced at him and said to Xiao Lan,’”‘Xiao Lan, you are not allowed to have any dealings with this kind of person in the future. Don’t bring shame to our Xiao Family.”
MO Xiu was a little unhappy. He had originally wanted to help Xiao Lan out of her predicament and at the same time express his goodwill to Xiao Hong. He did not expect Xiao Hong to have such an attitude.
“Senior, you can make it clear. Am I that kind of person?”
“I’m lecturing my own sister,” Xiao Hong sneered.”Since when is it someone else’s turn to interrupt?””
Although MO Xiu had a good temper, he was never one to swallow his anger.
“You’re talking about me? Can’t I ask? If I’m here today to scold you, Xiao Hong, for being a shrew, are you not allowed to ask?”
This was the first time Xiao Hong met MO Xiu’s gaze, and her eyes were filled with killing intent.
“Well done. Since I came to Yanjing University, you are the first person who dares to talk to me like this.”
MO Xiu placed his hands behind his back and said word by word, “It doesn’t matter who I’m talking to.”
Xiao Hong walked over step by step and stopped beside MO Xiu.
“I’ll show you what reason is today.!!”
Yang Qingzhuo immediately stood in front of Xiao Hong and said, “Sister Xiao Hong, there’s a rule in the university that seniors can’t attack juniors.”
“Yang Qingzhuo? Get out of my way!”
Xiao Hong’s voice was not as calm as before. She raised her voice, clearly angry.
MO Xiu pulled Yang Qingzhuo behind him and said, “There’s no need to go through so much trouble. Why don’t I challenge you?”
Everyone was shocked. There were many people gathered around. The Great Demon King wanted to challenge the third-year fiery goddess, Xiao Hong? How arrogant was this? He simply did not want to live.
Xiao Hong’s eyes narrowed. She didn’t understand MO Xiu’s motive. He actually dared to challenge her.
MO Xiu saw that Xiao Hong didn’t say anything, so he continued,’”‘How is it?
Senior Sister Xiao Hong, this way, you can attack me.”
When she said that, everyone thought that MO Xiu wanted to commit suicide. When Xiao Hong didn’t respond, she should have just run away. Why did she continue to provoke him?
Xiao Hong calmed down and said,””l don’t want to argue with you because I know your identity. You’re that person’s disciple.”
MO Xiu was shocked. How did Xiao Hong know about this?
In fact, MO Xiu didn’t know that the world was a place. Recently, Wang Lei and
wang yu remembered tnelr mission and went around publiclnng tnat MO Xlu was Mr. Tang’s apprentice.
Of course, ordinary people did not know, but a family with a royal background like the Xiao family had long known about this news.
“I don’t understand what you mean,” said Moxiu.”
Xiao Hong smiled.” Boring. I’ll let you off for now today. But you have to remember that no one can become a stumbling block or burden on my path. Xiao Lan can’t, but you…” It’s even more impossible..”

                    



Chapter 95: Awakening   1

After Xiao Hong finished speaking, she dragged Xiao Lan and left. The surrounding onlookers were all amazed. Who exactly was MO Xiu? Even Xiao Hong, a fearless woman, had to be wary.
After today, the fact that the Great Demon King MO Xiu had an astonishing background was confirmed.
MO Xiu and the others went upstairs to eat, and the crowd dispersed.
At the dining table, Dong Fang said in admiration,””Mo Xiu, I’m starting to admire you more and more now. You’re really good at picking up girls. You even dared to challenge Xiao Hong. You challenged her to leave a deep impression in her heart so that you can wait for an opportunity to strike in the future, right?”
Before MO Xiu could reply, Yang Qingzhuo asked anxiously,”Mo Xiu, is that really the case?”
MO Xiu punched Dong Fang’s head and said,””You don’t know anything else other than chasing after a girl. I knew she wouldn’t lower herself to fight me, so I challenged her.”
However, even though MO Xiu had said so, the few of them still admired his courage.
No one knew what was going on. In fact, Moxiu was panicking. At first, he didn’t think much of it, but when he saw Xiao Hong’s skill, he immediately regretted challenging her. If Xiao Hong had agreed, he might have been beaten up.
‘ Skill 1: Flame Blast 4
[Skill effect: Summon a fireball from the ground and explode at any location within 50 meters of the main body.] [Cooldown time: 30 minutes]
[Second Skill: Flame Spear 4]
[Skill Effect: Summons a flame spear. When held, increases the user’s attack by 1,000%, speed by 500%, and causes explosive elemental damage when thrown.]

Immune to 60% physical attacks and 30% elemental attacks other than water.
Speed increased by 300%. Additional skill: Fireball (No Cooldown)
[Duration: 10 minutes]
[Cooldown: 6 hours
This was the first time MO Xiu had seen a Level 4 and Level 5 skill on Xiao Hong.
Previously, in the Universe’s cram school, he had heard Wang Yu mention that the strongest known elemental skill was elementalization.
At that moment, MO Xiu was secretly praying that Xiao Hong would not accept his challenge.
After dinner, MO Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo returned home.
At this moment, Zheng Yi was holding Little Fushun and didn’t know what to do.
“What’s wrong with Little Fushun?” MO Xiu hurriedly asked.”
Zheng Yi handed Little Fu Shun to MO Xiu and said, ‘”‘1 don’t know either. When I didn’t see Little Fushun when I came back today, I felt that something was wrong. He used to be able to play tricks at home, but then I found him lying in bed listlessly in your bedroom.”
MO Xiu rubbed Little Fu Shun’s head, and when Little Fu Shun opened his eyes and saw MO Xiu, he meowed.
MO Xiu looked over and his eyes suddenly widened.
“Little Fushun, what’s wrong?”
“Meow “Are you feeling unwell? Does it hurt anywhere?”
“Meow “Okay, okay. Have a good rest.’
“Meow
Zheng Yi and Yang Qingzhuo were stunned. What was happening? “MO Xiu, do you understand what Little Fushun is saying?” Zheng Yi asked.”
“I don’t understand!”
“What about the conversation just now?”
“I guess, I guess he wants to hibernate.”
Zheng Yi was originally very serious, but when MO Xiu said this, he immediately retorted,””Big brother, stop joking. Little Fushun hibernates? Besides, it’s summer now.”
MO Xiu said, ” Go away, go away. Get out of the way. You know everything. Go prepare some meat and water to put in my room. We’ll eat it when Little Fushun wakes up.”‘
After saying that, MO Xiu left, leaving Zheng Yi fuming.
“Me? Ah, I’ll prepare it now.”
MO Xiu returned to his room and placed Little Fushun on his bed before covering him with a blanket.
Actually, the moment MO Xiu took the small Fu Shun, he felt that something was wrong. Little Fu Shun’s entire body was weak and limp.
In a moment of desperation, Moxiu used God’s Sight on Little Fu Shun. The last time he had successfully used it on a wild beast was when he was fighting the Demon Hawk.
In fact, when Xiao Fushungang had just arrived, Moxiu had used God’s Snooping once, but at that time, nothing could be read.
Innate Skill: Awakening to the middle…”
MO Xiu immediately understood that Little Fu Shun was currently in an awakened state, which was why he was so weak. He had just told Zheng Yi that he was hibernating.
However, Moxiu couldn’t figure it out. Weren’t wild beasts born with innate skills? Why did Little Fushun need to awaken? Right now, he could only take good care of Little Shun.
September 5th, the last day of the team competition preliminaries.
The most anticipated battle between the support system team one and the ability system team one was naturally the last to appear.
In the previous three matches, there had been no unexpected surprises. Power Assault System Team One, Elemental System Team One, Agility System
Team One had successfully advanced. Now, they were only missing one more spot.
Mu Mu was in a much better condition today, and his signature bright smile was on his face again.
From coming to the venue to now, I haven’t said a word about the events of the competition, I’ve been chatting with a few people about unimportant things.
They were about to go on stage. MO Xiu asked Mu Mu,’”‘Coach Mu, we are about to go on stage. Don’t you have anything to say?”
Mu Mu still smiled and said, “Of course there is. That is…”
Seeing Mu Mu’s expression, they thought that he had some secret tactic, so they all leaned closer to listen.
“That means you can do it! ”
MO Xiu and the others looked at Mu Mu in confusion. They had prepared so much during the competition and analyzed so much information, but they were not going to say anything? This was too unlike Mu Mu.
I was wrong before,” Mu Mu said seriously.” As the leader of this team, I have complete faith in your abilities now. You can deal with any unexpected situation.’”‘
“If there’s one thing that I’m better than the ability coaches, it’s my trust in you. We’re not worse than any other team.”
Mu Mu’s words boosted everyone’s confidence.
He walked onto the stage with a different mood than before. At this moment, the ability user was standing opposite him.
“Are you ready to be eliminated?” said Barrymie as soon as he came up.”
Moxiu had seen the match between Barry and Zhou Qiuwu, and he knew that this person was not an arrogant person.
Barrymi’s repeated provocations were just to anger the support system members and make them unable to perform normally in battle. After all, it was not against the rules to interfere outside the field.
‘ Don’t try to provoke us,” Moxiu said directly.” We all have good tempers. Let’s use our strength to speak.’”‘
Hearing that he had been seen through, Jeremy changed the topic and said, “Hahaha, Brother MO is amazing. You saw through my little trick with a single glance. I’m truly impressed. Others say that you’re a great devil king, but I don’t think so. I feel that no matter if it’s your character or your strength, you’re superior to others.”
MO Xiu felt awkward when he heard this. Wasn’t this fellow changing way too quickly? Just now, he was still speaking ill of her, but now, he was flattering her.
Yang Qingzhuo closed his nose and whispered beside MO Xiu, “This person is shameless!”
Although his voice was soft, it was still heard by Jeremy. However, Jeremy didn’t have any reaction. Instead, he cupped his hands towards Yang Qingzhuo.
This Berri… How shameless..

                    



Chapter 96: My Nanny Is Super Godly (1)

Before the start of the match, Moxiu carefully observed the five opponents. Just as he had expected, he had already seen the skills of four of them, leaving the last girl untouched.
‘ Skill 1: Enormalization 2
[Skill effect: Increases the size of any part of the body. All attributes of the enlarged part will increase by 300%.]
[Duration: Can be used 10 times in 10 minutes, 5 seconds each time]
[Cooldown time: 3 hours]
After looking at the skills of all five Esper Ability users, Moxiu’s thoughts were in a mess. These five skills were too compatible, and there were too many tactics that could be used. For a moment, he was unable to sort out a
countermeasure.
At this time, the host began to introduce the members of the competition.
“Next up is the most important match of the entire qualifiers. Support system team one versus ability system team one! !”
The audience responded to the host with cheers.
“First, we will introduce the support system. Xiao Lan, Yang Qingzhuo, He
Lingyue, Hu Xianming, and our Great Demon King…Mo Xiu!”
“Next up is the ability department. Jeremy…”
The five Esper Ability users were Barry, Jiang Feng who had the Life Link and
Heresy, Qian Deshun who had the Earth Prison, Li Zhi who had the
Petrification, and the last one, Chen Peipei, who had the Magnification.
While the host was still introducing, He Lingyue asked,””Mo Xiu, how are we going to fight later?”
MO Xiu thought for a moment and said, “Xiao Lan and I will attack first. The three of you stay together and don’t separate.’”‘
After MO Xiu finished speaking, the host announced the start of the competition.
The match had just begun. MO Xiu and Xiao Lan were the first to release their skills. The two of them attacked first, while the other three followed behind, waiting for an opportunity to strike.
The five Esper Ability users didn’t move. When MO Xiu and Xiao Lan got close, Chen Peipei used her size amplification skill and enlarged her right hand. She grabbed Qian Deshun and threw him behind MO Xiu and Xiao Lan.
MO Xiu remembered that Qian Deshun’s skill was to draw a circle on the ground to activate the skill. Among the three people behind him, Hu Xianming and Yang Qingzhuo were not weak and should be able to handle it.
Motheo didn’t mind. According to the plan, one of him and Xiao Lan would hold back Jeremy, while the other would kill as many members of the other party as possible.
However, when Motheo went up against Jeremy, he realized that something was wrong.
Qian Deshun didn’t draw a circle. Instead, he stepped on the boundary line, and a yellow line appeared where he stepped. Then, he ran quickly and drew a big arc. Yang Qingzhuo and the other two were in the arc.
MO Xiu frowned. Qian Deshun couldn’t activate his skill unless he drew a complete circle. Could it be that his skill had leveled up in just one day?
According to Qian Deshun’s running route, if he wanted to draw a complete circle, he had to go out of bounds…
Thinking of this, Moxiu carefully looked at the traces left behind by Qian
Deshun. They formed a quarter circle in the inner circle.
It wasn’t until Qian Deshun ran out of bounds that Moxiu finally understood.
Qian Deshun wanted to use the price of going out of bounds to draw a complete
circle to trap the three of them and finish the remaining three-quarters of the circle outside of bounds.
“Yang Qingzhuo, save Hu Xianming! Ah!”
Moxiu shouted to remind Yang Qingzhuo, but he was hit by Jeremy’s laser. The laser hit his lower abdomen, and blood was already flowing out. He turned around and saw that Barrymie was smiling at him.
“Brother MO, you’re underestimating me too much.”
Mothew quickly dodged Barrie’s next laser and tried to close the distance between them.
Yang Qingzhuo immediately took action after receiving the order. He cast the skill on himself and Hu Xianming, increasing their speed by 400%.
Although the two of them didn’t know what was going on, the yellow lines on the ground were definitely strange. The two of them quickly ran out of the line.
Although He Lingyue didn’t have a speed bonus, she still tried to run out of the lane.
At the same time, Xiao Lan attacked Jiang Feng, Li Zhi, and Chen Pei Pei.
The battlefield was divided into three parts. Moxiu and Barramy were holding each other back, Xiao Lan was attacking, and Yang Qingzhuo and the other two were trying to run out of the yellow line.
At this moment, a voice that could change the outcome of the battle rang out.
“Set it for me!”
His voice was loud and penetrating. The three words seemed to have some kind of curse. Moxiu paused for a moment.
After reacting, he immediately dodged Barramy’s attack and almost got injured.
That was… Not good! It was Jiang Feng’s heresy.
Looking at the other two sides, they were actually in danger.
Due to everyone’s mental defense being different, the time they were frozen was also different.
First, Xiao Lan had just launched an attack when she was stopped by Heresy. Chen Pei Pei did not let go of this opportunity. She directly enlarged her hands and held Xiao Lan tightly. Li Zhi quickly activated the skill Petrify.
Xiao Lan had just woken up at this moment. She struggled for a moment before she was petrified again.
Although the defense of the petrified state had increased, its speed had dropped to zero and it could not move.
Chen Pei Pei used Xiao Lan’s petrified state to lift her up high, wanting to throw her out of the arena.
On the other side, Yang Qingxue and Hu Xianming were running at full speed. They were frozen by the sudden sound and couldn’t move.
As Motheo was worried about the others, he didn’t notice Jeremy. Another laser shot at him.
The three sides were suffering. MO Xiu was about to be injured, Xiao Lan was about to be eliminated, and Qian Deshun was about to finish drawing a circle to trap Yang Qingzhuo and the other two.
At this critical moment, five white lights appeared almost simultaneously on the five support-type people.
On Moxiu’s side, the white light negated the damage from the laser.
On Xiao Lan’s side, the white light had purified the negative status. Although she was still in a petrified state, her speed had recovered. The moment she was about to be thrown out, she grabbed Chen Peipei’s finger and jumped to the ground.
On Yang Qingzhuo’s side, the three of them regained their freedom at the same time. Before Qian Deshun finished drawing the circle, Yang Qingzhuo and Hu Xianming ran out of the circle.
The five white lights were Hu Xianming’s holy light. His body was frozen, but his consciousness was still there. Hu Xianming had an idea and displayed his godly control.
Mu Mu let out a sigh of relief. It was too dangerous.
The opponent’s guidance was definitely not simple. The tactics and cooperation of the ability users were too amazing. Mu Mu admitted that his previous tactics were useless. Fortunately, he allowed his team members to freely play, thanks to Hu Xianming’s god-like operation.
It wasn’t just Mu Mu. The entire stadium was in shock. When the ability system’s strategy was displayed, almost everyone thought that the match was about to end. They didn’t expect such a turn of events.
A healer’s godly operation pulled the entire team out of the abyss. The ability system’s strategy failed and they lost a member. Qian Deshun was out of bounds and eliminated.
On the field, Moxiu revealed a smile. He had been distracted. From the start of the match, he had been thinking about how to deal with the opponent’s skills. This kind of thinking had become a burden, preventing him from unleashing his full strength.
It was only when Hu Xianming’s five rays of white light had lit up that MO Xiu was finally reassured. With such an excellent teammate, what was there to worry about? Just let it go.
The ability users didn’t expect such a situation. The situation that they were certain to win was inexplicably resolved. The four people on the field were at a loss.
Jeremy was stunned and said to Motheo,”What’s going on?”
MO Xiu smiled slightly and said, “Is there a need to ask?” My nanny is super godly! “

                    



Chapter 97: Turning the Tide

The Esper class was well-trained. After a short moment of panic, they immediately returned to combat mode.
Chen Peipei’s hands were still enlarging as she grabbed Jiang Feng and Li Zhi and threw them into the distance. Her target was Qian Deshun’s circle.
As the height of the throw was very high, Xiao Lan was unable to stop them. She could only watch helplessly as the two entered the circle.
At this moment, He Lingyue was the only one in the circle. The moment Li Zhi and Jiang Feng landed in the circle, He Lingyue made a prompt decision and released Future on MO Xiu before walking out of the circle.
This was the best solution He Lingyue could think of. If she added the skill to herself and fought with the two of them, she might not be able to win, and the skill would be wasted.
If he didn’t use his skill, it would be even more disadvantageous for him to be stunned and lose consciousness. He might as well give the skill to Moxiu and go out of bounds to avoid being stunned. Moxiu also obtained the skill.
With Future’s ability, Motheo was able to predict the direction of the Barramy laser.
Xiao Lan’s side had the advantage against Chen Peipei, forcing Chen Peipei to retreat.
At this moment, Barrymi spread his wings and flew directly to Chen Peipei’s side, picking her up.
Barry carried Chen Peipei and flew in the air. Moxiu and Xiao Lan couldn’t do anything about it.
“You didn’t forget, did you?” said Jeremy. I can fly.”
The current situation was that two Espers were in the air and two were in the circle.
Yang Qingzhuo and Hu Xianming were the closest to them, and they took the lead in attacking Li Zhi and Jiang Feng.
Moxiu and Xiao Lan also rushed over at full speed, but no matter how fast they were, they couldn’t be faster than Jeremy’s laser.
A laser beam shot directly in front of Yang Qingzhuo and the other two, preventing them from continuing to attack.
As he was flying, his speed was even faster. He flew directly in front of Li Zhi and Jiang Feng, and the two of them each grabbed one of his legs.
Just like that, Jeremy and his three teammates flew up.
At this moment, the time limit of the Earth Prison was up, and the circle disappeared.
Motheo looked at Jeremy in the sky and felt a headache coming on. What kind of rogue tactic was this?
Then, the audience saw a strange scene. Jeremy was dragging three people in the sky and shooting lasers down.
On the ground, Moxiu and the others ran back and forth to avoid the laser beams.
This situation lasted for two minutes, causing the audience to grow impatient.
“Can we determine the winner by fighting like this?”
“Espers are obviously stronger. Why are they using such tactics?”
“The ability department has placed all their hopes on the first tactic.”
Mothethew was thinking as he dodged. What was Barrymi’s motive for doing this?
Although the support system had two strong points, the ability system was not weak either. Why did they have to waste time like this?
Moxiu suddenly thought of a possibility. Li Zhi’s Petrification skill had a cooldown of three minutes. It should be about time now.
At this moment, Li Zhi suddenly dropped to the ground.
Because of Barry’s constant harassment, the four Support players had long lost their formation. At this moment, the four were separated.
Xiao Lan and Hu Xianming, who were the closest to the drop point, were annoyed by the harassment. When they saw someone fall, they immediately ran over and attacked without thinking.
“Don’t go over!” Moxiu shouted.!”
Unfortunately, it was too late. The two of them had already arrived and launched an attack.
Just as the two of them hit Li Zhi, Li Zhi used Petrify on herself, increasing her defense by 800%, blocking the two of them.
Just as Xiao Lan and Li Zhi were about to push Li Zhi out of the boundary, a laser shot at Xiao Lan.
Hu Xianming immediately prepared to use the holy light to heal him, but before he could do so, a giant palm slapped down and knocked him unconscious.
Hu Xianming eliminated!
Even though Yang Qingzhuo had used all his skills on MO Xiu, who had 800% speed, he still wasn’t able to save Hu Xianming in time.
Hu Xianming was eliminated. Chen Pei Pei, Li Zhi, and Jiang Feng attacked the injured Xiao Lan at the same time.
Mohiu wanted to help, but was stopped by Jeremy.
However, Moxiu’s speed was too fast. Even if Remy flew, he wouldn’t be able to catch up to Moxiu.
Seeing Moxiu pass by him, Jeremy fired another laser at Xiao Lan!
Xiao Lan was hit again. She, who was seriously injured, once again showed her weakness of weak willpower. She was passive in the competition and was almost forced out of the boundary by the few people.
Xiao Lan was eliminated!.
MO Xiu saw that Xiao Lan had been eliminated, so he didn’t stop at all and continued to charge forward.
As Chen Peipei and the other two were at the border, MO Xiu arrived in front of Li Zhi and kicked with all his might.
Li Zhi could not react in time and could not block this kick. He was directly kicked out.
Li Zhi was eliminated!
Chen Peipei and Jiang Feng were shocked and immediately joined forces to block Mo Xiu.
Jeremy hadn’t expected that MO Xiu would be so decisive and immediately think of a way to deal with it.
He sped up at full speed and continuously shot out lasers to interfere.
Yang Qingzhuo was not idle either. After seeing that Motheo was in position, he immediately cast a skill on himself and chased after Barramy to disrupt him.
Motheo was fighting one against two, and with Barry’s interference, he couldn’t take down the two of them.
Although Yang Qingzhuo had the advantage in speed, his attack power was not enough. He could definitely dodge, but it was very difficult to stop Jeremy. He was sent flying in just two moves.
Jeremy knew that Yang Qingzhuo was very fast. Even though he had hit Yang Qingzhuo, he did not continue to attack. He had fallen into a trap and continued to chase after Moxiu without looking back.
Yang Qingzhuo had just gotten up from the ground and was about to continue harassing MO Xiu when he saw MO Xiu’s left hand making a ‘three’ gesture behind his back.
As a support, the most important thing was to pay attention to every move of the main attacker on the battlefield.
Even though MO Xiu’s actions were very subtle and fast, Yang Qingzhuo still saw it.
Yang Qingzhuo gave up chasing after MO Xiu after seeing the gesture. He stood still and stared at MO Xiu.
Barry was burning with anxiety. One second later, one of his teammates might be eliminated. When he was less than three meters away from Motheo, he fired another laser.
Mothew did not dodge the attack immediately. Barrymi and Chen Peipei, who was in front of Mothew, both felt that the attack would hit!
MO Xiu’s left hand made a ‘six’ gesture. Yang Qingzhuo accurately captured this detail and used all his skills on MO Xiu alone.
A strange action and an unexpected ending!
Moxiu suddenly turned his body sideways and sucked in his stomach, dodging the laser. The laser accurately hit Chen Peipei, who had been in front of Moxiu.
Chen Pei Pei did not expect that the laser would hit her. After she was injured, she subconsciously took two steps back and walked out of the boundary.
Chen Peipei was eliminated!
Barry looked at Moxiu in disbelief. In just a few seconds, he had eliminated two teammates in a row and saved the situation.
Mu Mu couldn’t help but shout.
‘Yay! Good job, MO Xiu.”
The audience below the stage was also looking at something. Could this be the finals? The game had only been going on for a few minutes, and there were already several reversals.
Just now, the Esper Ability user had used a realistic trap to force the Support
Ability user into a desperate situation. In less than ten seconds, the Great Demon King Moxiu had single-handedly turned the tide and eliminated two Esper Ability users in a row.
The battle returned to a draw, two against two!
After a second of silence, the audience burst into applause.
The audience started to support the support system that was not favored at the beginning.
“MO Xiu is awesome! The support system is awesome!”

                    



Chapter 98: Victory (1)

Barry couldn’t let MO Xiu eliminate Jiang Feng again, so he immediately stood in front of Jiang Feng.
“It’s a two-on-two now!” said MO Xiu.
“That’s right!” said Jeremy.
The two of them began to attack each other. It had to be said that Bai Ruimi’s combat ability was very strong. There was no need to mention the laser. His attack speed was fast, and when he had wings, he could even hack people.
The two of them were locked in a fight. Seeing that he couldn’t intervene, Jiang Feng went to Yang Qingzhuo.
He thought that this weak little girl was easy to deal with, but he realized how difficult Yang Qingzhuo was.
Neither of them used any skills and were purely engaging in close combat.
Yang Qingzhuo knew that he was useless now, so he attacked with all his might.
On the other side, Moxiu and Jeremy had yet to decide the winner. On the other side, Yang Qingzhuo and Jiang Feng had tied and were out of bounds together.
Jiang Feng had used his Life Link Link skill to connect Barry and Moxiu together.
Jiang Feng and Yang Qingzhuo were eliminated!
The situation on the field was very clear. It was a one-on-one.
Jeremy had been at a disadvantage. Motheo had speed bonuses and Future bonuses, so he could predict his movements.
Every time he fought back, Motheo would punch him hard, leaving him in a sorry state.
However, things were different now. There was a life connection between Barramy and Motheo, so Barramy could use his wings to defend himself.
Whenever Motheo attacked, Barramy would use his wings to block it. This way, due to the connection of life, Motheo would deal 50% of his attack power.
This way, Moxiu would be at a loss. No matter how he fought, he would be at a
disadvantage.
‘ Brother MO, don’t drag it out any longer. Admit defeat. I admit that your combat ability is stronger than mine, but Jiang Feng’s skill has connected us together. I’ve been using my wings to defend, and you can’t do anything to me!””
Moxiu lowered his head and thought for a moment. Suddenly, he raised his head and hit his own head with his right hand.
“I’m so stupid. We’re connected, right?”
Jeremy said,” That’s right. I can tell you that my wings have very high defense. At least, it’s higher than your own defense! ‘”‘
MO Xiu nodded.” Oh, I see. Then do you think your defense is higher than mine?
‘ So what if you don’t?” said Jeremy indifferently.” I won’t let you hit me beyond my wings.
” You’re mistaken,” Moxiu said sincerely.” I won’t hit you again!””
“You want to admit defeat? Aiyo! It hurts.”
Next, the audience saw a scene that they would never forget.
Motheo hit himself, and Barrymi went up to pull Motheo away, not letting him hit him.
A competition could be like this? So loving?
In fact, Motheo Imew that his defense was higher than that of Barry’s. Since both of them received equal damage, he could just hit himself!
A minute later, Barramy couldn’t take it anymore and admitted defeat. When he walked off the stage, he said to MO Xiu,”l don’t understand!”
“What do you not understand?”
“The overall strength of our ability department is not inferior to yours, and we have a delicate plan. Why did we lose?”
“I’ll give you a sentence. This sentence was given to me by one of my enemies.”
“What words?”
“There is no perfect setup, only a perfect breaker!”
This was what Wang Jinyang said when he was captured. MO Xiu had always remembered it.
The competition ended and the top four appeared. The one who advanced was unexpectedly the support- type.
This year was supposed to be the most promising year for the ability department, but they were unfortunately defeated. Although they were unwilling, they still acknowledged the strength of the support department.
This was also the first time the Support Faculty had entered the top four. All the students were very excited.
Of course, the teachers were no exception. In order to commemorate this historic moment, all the teachers of the supporting department had taken a photo with the first team of the supporting department. The competition was supposed to end at four in the afternoon, but due to this mess, Moxiu only left the school at nine in the evening.
When MO Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo returned home, Zheng Yi was preparing the ingredients.
“Yo! Zheng Yi, you’ve grown up. Are you ready to cook?”
When Zheng Yi saw Yang Qingzhuo, it was as if he had seen his savior. He quickly pulled Yang Qingzhuo into the kitchen.
“F * ck, why are you guys only back now? I’m starving. I can only try to cook by myself, but I realize that I can’t do it!”
Yang Qingzhuo was hungry as well. He immediately got busy as soon as he entered the kitchen. He wanted to eat as soon as possible.
“After the competition ended, we were stopped by the teachers and were not allowed to leave.”
“That awesome? Does that mean you won? Creating history? How do you feel
“I don’t feel anything. I don’t feel like I’m creating history.””
Zheng Yi raised his middle finger.”
“Oh right, how’s Little Fushun?” MO Xiu asked. Are you awake?”
“It’s still the same. I’ve been sleeping all the time, but my appetite hasn’t decreased. I don’t know when the meat I prepared before was eaten up, but I prepared it again.”
MO Xiu patted Zheng Yi’s arm and said,””You’ve worked hard!”
“Hey, don’t be so polite. Isn’t your son my son?”
MO Xiu glared at Zheng Yi. This guy was really not serious.
After dinner, MO Xiu returned to his room. Little Fu Shun was still sleeping. When he looked closely at Little Fu Shun’s back, he saw a faint golden light emitting from it.
Using God’s Sight to check, it still showed that the skill was awakening.
He didn’t know how many more days Little Fushun would awaken, so he could only wait.
He was speechless for a night.
The next morning, MO Xiu came to school. When he walked to the Support Department office, he saw a huge banner.
On it was written,” First grade team competition, support department advanced to the top four!”
There was also a group photo below the banner. It was a group photo of the support department team and all the teachers from yesterday.
He didn’t write any congratulatory words. He simply hung up this matter for everyone to see. Coupled with the sudden group photo, it was extremely awkward.
MO Xiu lowered his head and walked into the office, afraid that someone would recognize him. His reputation was already bad, and this time, he hung the photo upstairs.
In fact, after yesterday’s battle, MO Xiu’s reputation had changed greatly.
Originally, MO Xiu’s image in the eyes of other people was that he had some strength but was not top-notch. He relied on the power of his family to do whatever he wanted, so he was called the Great Demon King.
Yesterday’s battle, he had single-handedly turned the tide, and in the end, he had challenged Barramy. Everyone realized that Motheo’s strength was terrifying, and he was the strongest in the first grade.
The way she called him the Great Demon King had changed. It was originally meant to be sarcastic, but now it had become the real Great Demon King!
This time, he came to the office to look for Cao Fenglin. The firearms incident had always been something that Moxiu was worried about. However, due to his lack of information, he could only come to Cao Fenglin to ask.
MO Xiu knocked on the door and entered. When Cao Fenglin saw that it was MO
Xiu, he said helplessly, “‘Why are you here again?” “I want to inquire about the progress of the firearms incident!” “Didn’t you see the mission at the top of the Shadow app?
“I see it!”
“Then why did you come looking for me?”
“I accepted that mission.”
Cao Fenglin covered his face and said,” You’re really persistent. Once that mission is out, many big shots will come out. There’s no need for you at all.”‘
“I’m only here to ask you for information! ”
“I already said that I won’t help you. Why are you asking me?”
“But among the people I know, only you know the development of this matter, and… You’ve been paying attention to it, haven’t you?” “Alright, I can tell you, things…lt’s getting worse..”

                    



Chapter 99: Surrounding the Four-Man Group

“How could that be?” Moxiu asked in disbelief. All the forces were following up on this matter, so why did it worsen?”
Cao Fenglin took out a stack of documents from the drawer and handed it to Mo Xiu.
“You can read it yourself. The document can only be read here.”
MO Xiu flipped through the documents and saw the new cases of injuries. He was shocked.
The reason why Cao Fenglin said that the situation was serious was because there had been cases of law enforcement members being shot dead in the past two days.
Moreover, many of the cases happened in public places and were witnessed by some people.
It was already very difficult to suppress the matter now. Many people knew about this and it was spreading on a small scale.
After MO Xiu finished reading it, he closed the document and handed it back to Cao Fenglin.
“Is it going to be reported?”
Cao Fenglin nodded and remained silent.
“About how long?” MO Xiu sighed.”
“Very soon. Within this month, the relevant departments will try their best to suppress the news.”
Moxiu stood up and said,”l understand. I’ll leave first!’”‘
After leaving the office, MO Xiu’s heart was heavy. He immediately called Yue Yuan and told him about the matter, asking him to take good care of his mother.
He also called his friends to remind them to be careful.
Once it was reported and the matter of firearms was made public, it would cause a lot of chain reactions.
Firstly, there would be panic and riots in many places.
Secondly, there would be protests, which would affect the progress of the investigation and cause further riots.
Finally, what Moxiu was most worried about was what the mastermind would do next.
The mastermind behind the scenes had spread firearms in order to create chaos. Now that he had undoubtedly succeeded, what was his next step?
No matter what he did, it would definitely create greater chaos. At that time, everyone would be in danger.
After walking out of the office, Moxiu went straight to the activity room of the
Strongest Club. According to the plan, he would carry out the mission of encircling the Montenegro Gang of Four today.
When he walked into the activity room, everyone else was already seated.
MO Xiu also walked to his seat and sat down.”Hao Ren, tell me about the mission.”
Hao Ren stood up, walked to the front and said,””Due to the delay of the mission, I have more time to gather information.”
“Let’s talk about this group of four first. The origins of these four people are unknown, and we can’t find anything about them in the past. We only know that after they went to the Montenegro to become sworn brothers, they changed their names to Black One, Black Two, Black Three, and Black Four.”
Dong Fang chuckled when he heard the name.
“Hahaha, what kind of name is that? It’s even worse than the names given by the authors of urban novels I read!”
MO Xiu scolded the anchor,”Shut up!” Listen carefully.”
Hao Ren continued,” Each of these four people has their own characteristics.
They commit all kinds of crimes. The surrounding residents have been harmed. Black One and Black Two are the strongest, and their skills should be offensive. Black Three is extremely fast and is responsible for stealing. Black Four’s skills have the effect of mental confusion and are responsible for abducting innocent women!”
He Lingyue pursed her lips and said, “Hmph, he even kidnapped a good woman.
Such a person deserves to die!””
Yang Qingzhuo and Du Ya agreed. The three girls were surprisingly united.
“In terms of terrain, they are occupying a small mountain. You may not believe it, but they only have four people, but they are heavily guarded.” Hao Ren said as he took out the map and showed it to everyone.
“Here! There was a large courtyard at the top of the mountain, which was their stronghold. It was surrounded by surveillance cameras. If anyone went up the mountain, they would be the first to notice.”
“Is there anyone else in their stronghold?” Moxiu asked.”
Hao Ren thought for a moment and said,” No one has seen anyone up there. But they have robbed a lot of women. I guess there are innocent women up there.””
“Alright, is there anything else you want to ask?” said Moxiu.”
No one spoke. MO Xiu continued, “Alright, let’s go. Let’s go and gather some information nearby!”
The Strongest Club was swift and decisive, and the seven of them quickly arrived at the foot of the Montenegro.
Moxiu looked at the other six people and shook his head. He had wanted to send someone to check the location of the cameras, but after looking around, not a single person was a professional investigator.
“Hao Ren!”
“What’s wrong?”
“After we return, recruit a strong scout for me.”
“Understood ! ”
“Who can go and investigate?” Moxiu asked the others. Find out all the cameras.”
Moxiu did this not because he was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to defeat the Montenegro Four-man Team, but because he was afraid that the strongest team would be discovered the moment they went up the mountain. It was time for them to escape.
The six of them volunteered to go. If they all went, it would be too big of a target.
In the end, MO Xiu selected the members and sent Hao Ren, Liu Ziyang, and Yang Qingzhuo to investigate.
He sent Liu Ziyang and Yang Qingzhuo because they were the fastest and should be able to avoid the cameras. He also sent Hao Ren to record the exact location of the cameras.
MO Xiu, He Lingyue, Du Ya, and Dong Fang, the four people who stayed behind, began to study tactics according to the available information. Dong Fang could not participate.
The three of them left at 9 am and didn’t come back until 6 pm.
MO Xiu and the others had been waiting until they were about to fall asleep. When they saw the three of them return, they immediately perked up.
“How is it?” asked MO Xiu.
Hao Ren handed a map to Moxiu and said,””l didn’t fail my mission! There were a total of two surveillance cameras. The first was at the foot of the mountain, where the cameras were loosely arranged. They could enter once they found a blind spot. The second was at the mountainside, where they needed to use speed to break through. Finally, at the top of the mountain, there was only one camera at the top. It was basically a decoration, and there were too many blind spots.”
“Alright!” said MO Xiu. In that case, how about we attack tomorrow?”
Everyone agreed, but one person objected.
It was Yang Qingzhuo! Yang Qingzhuo, who had always been obedient to MO Xiu, actually opposed MO Xiu’s opinion.
MO Xiu also felt that it was strange. When Yang Qingzhuo returned, he felt that his expression was not right. He was not as lively as before.
“What’s wrong? Did something happen?”
MO Xiu asked softly.
Yang Qingzhuo was so aggrieved that tears were about to flow out. He grabbed the corner of MO Xiu’s shirt and said,”Mo Xiu, let’s fight them today and kill those bastards, alright?”
” There’s no hurry,” MO Xiu asked.” Tell me slowly. What exactly happened?””
I was the only one who reached the top of the mountain,” said Yang Qingzhuo.” I looked into one of the rooms out of curiosity. There were many big sisters locked up in cages.’”‘
MO Xiu frowned. It seemed like things were worse than he had imagined.
Everyone understood what Yang Qingzhuo meant. It must be that the four of Montenegro didn’t treat the women as humans.
“MO Xiu, let’s go up today!” He Lingyue said.”
Before MO Xiu could say anything, Du Ya’s temper flared up.
“MO Xiu, give me a straightforward answer. If you don’t go up, I’ll go up myself tonight. We’ll talk about those four bastards later.”
“Aiya, look at how anxious you guys are. Go!” MO Xiu hurriedly said. It’s a little early now. Let’s go back and change into black clothes first. We’ll wait for them to fall asleep and catch them off guard.”
The three girls looked like they couldn’t wait any longer. MO Xiu comforted them for a while before the three girls obediently listened.
The four men looked at each other and smiled. They…He was also very angry!
It was already past eleven o’clock at night when they were ready. Seeing that it was about time, Moxiu made a gesture and everyone set off.
“Tonight, we will attack Montenegro! “

                    



Chapter 100: Night Attack on Montenegro Mountain

With MO Xiu’s order, all seven of them moved out.
Hao Ren was looking for the blind spots in the first circle.
The first round of surveillance cameras came over easily. They didn’t hear any movement at the top of the mountain, so they shouldn’t have been discovered. The seven of them stopped in front of the second circle of surveillance cameras.
He Lingyue looked at MO Xiu and asked, “How do we pass this round?’”‘ “Yang Qingzhuo, use your skills on everyone one by one and use speed to pass.
” We’ll break through with our speed,” Moxiu asked Hao Ren.” Will we really not be able to see anything from the surveillance cameras?””
“There will be a black shadow. If you don’t look carefully, you won’t even be able to see the black shadow.”
At this moment, Dong Fang said casually, “No problem. It’s so late and they’re all asleep. Who would watch the surveillance cameras?”
Dong Fang was right. There were only four people in total, and one of them had to watch the surveillance cameras. Moreover, there were hundreds of surveillance cameras. It was impossible for them to notice a black shadow on a screen.
Everyone looked at MO Xiu, waiting for him to speak.
“I think we should be more cautious. If we alert the enemy, our preparations will be in vain,” said Moxiu.”
“What do you think we should do?” Hao Ren asked.”
“It’s easy to be discovered if there are continuous shadows on one screen. How many screens are there?”
“You mean we broke through the surveillance cameras at different points?” He
Lingyue continued.”
“That’s right. We’ll do that later…”
Once the strategy was set, the seven of them began to move.
Yang Qingzhuo added the skill status to Moxiu, and Moxiu immediately jumped over the surveillance.
After MO Xiu walked over, he gestured for the rest to move forward. After about fifty meters, He Lingyue came over.
After another 50 meters, Du Ya came over.
This method of breaking through the surveillance cameras one by one while moving was indeed the safest.
However, everyone felt that Moxiu was being a little too careful. Was there anyone staring at the surveillance screen at this late hour?
In the monitoring room of the mountaintop courtyard, there were ten women sitting neatly inside. They were staring at the surveillance camera intently. A few of them saw a black shadow appear on the screen. After the ten of them looked at each other, one of the women stood up and walked out with a painful expression.
He walked to the door of a room and knocked. Not long after, the door opened and a naked man poked his head out.
“Damn it, what’s wrong? Knocking on the door in the middle of the night?”
The woman trembled as she said, “Fourth Master, we just saw a black shadow in the surveillance room. It appeared on multiple screens…”
The woman tried her best to describe what she saw in detail.
The man called Lord Fourth slapped the woman to the ground.
“Damn it, aren’t you looking at the shadow? You woke me up because of this.”
The man didn’t seem to be satisfied. He stepped forward and kicked twice again. “Hurry up and get lost!”
The woman was first slapped and then kicked twice. From the beginning to the end, she did not shout out and kept her mouth tightly shut.
When he heard the word ‘scram,’ he immediately got up and ran.
At the mountainside, the seven of them broke through the surveillance cameras. All they had to do now was slowly climb up and not be discovered.
The seven of them carefully climbed to the top of the mountain and saw the so-called courtyard.
Originally, MO Xiu thought that the courtyard would be very messy if the four men lived on the mountaintop. He did not expect that it would actually be very tidy from the outside.
There was no one inside or outside the courtyard. The Montenegro Group of Four should be in their rooms.
Moxiu went around alone and found a total of eight rooms.
After he came back, he discussed with the others. Out of the eight rooms, excluding the cell that Yang Qingzhuo saw earlier, there were seven rooms left.
There were exactly seven people in the strongest club, and each of them could check one room.
Moxiu estimated from the appearance of the rooms that four of them were exceptionally large. They should be the rooms of the four brothers.
Moxiu quickly made the allocation.
MO Xiu, Du Ya, Liu Ziyang, Dong Fang, and the other four were stronger in combat. Each of them chose one of the four rooms, and the remaining three went into the other three rooms. There shouldn’t be any danger.
The seven of them immediately took action. At this moment, the seven of them had arrived at the courtyard. Each of them was at the door of a room. They were waiting for Moxiu’s signal, and the seven of them would break in at the same time.
MO Xiu extended his right hand.
Three
Two
One
As Moxiu waved his hand, the seven of them rushed into the room together.
Seven people, seven rooms, different sceneries, and the same anger. After Moxiu entered the room, he immediately cast God’s Sight on the man in the room.
‘ Skill 1: Confusion
[Skill effect: Obstructs a target from thinking normally, causing the target to lose their guard against the outside world.]
[Cooldown: 3 hours]
[Second Skill: Bewitched
[Skill effect: Implant a certain belief in a target’s brain.]

[Skill 3: Blurred Memory]
[Skill effect: Fades the memories of a target, causing the memories to become blurry.]

24 hours.] [Cooldown: 3 hours]
[Skill 4: Brain Impact 2]
[Skill effect: Directly attacks the target’s brain. There is a certain chance of causing the target to die.]
[Cooldown time: 3 days]
The four skills were similar, and the person who could choose these four skills definitely had evil intentions.
Without a doubt, MO Xiu knew that this person was Hei Si, who specialized in abducting women.
Moxiu immediately activated the Descent of the Martial God to strengthen his mental defense to prevent the other party from attacking.
“Who are you? How did you get in?”
Only then did MO Xiu take a closer look. At this moment, there was a woman under Hei Si.
Black Four got off the bed and asked, “Who the hell are you?” Aren’t you afraid of death?”
Moxiu replied, “I’m the one who wants your life. You…” Are you afraid of death?”
On Du Ya’s side, after she rushed in, she saw a burly man sleeping soundly on the bed and three women kneeling on the ground.
The sound of the door breaking woke the burly man up, but Du Ya ignored him and helped one of the women up.
After the woman stood up, she looked at Du Ya blankly. Then, she knelt down in panic and kowtowed to the burly man.
The burly man walked up to the woman and stepped on her head.
“Yo, a little girl barged in. She’s so beautiful. Are you feeling lonely?”
“Swoosh!”
The burly man, who was still teasing Du Ya, found that he could not speak. He touched it with his hand and his mouth opened and his tongue broke! “You actually want to insult me with your stinky mouth?” The burly man panicked and even forgot to use his skill on Du Ya.
“Swoosh!”
Another hand knife!
“Did you use this foot to step on this woman just now?”
The burly man opened his mouth, but he could not make a sound. His expression was extremely painful.
“Shua! Shua!”
“You hit a woman with both hands, right?”
“Shua! Swoosh! Shua!”
On Liu Ziyang’s side, he saw a live Japanese acrobatics show after entering the door.
Even someone as thick-skinned as Liu Ziyang couldn’t help but blush.
Seeing someone enter, the man stopped what he was doing and sized up Liu Ziyang seriously.
“Brother, you are?”
“Don’t ask me who I am. Just tell me who you are.” Liu Ziyang pretended to be mysterious.”
“Brother, you must be joking. You barged into my room and don’t know who I am? I am Montenegro Black One!”
Liu Ziyang smiled smugly. This time, he was going to make a contribution and catch Boss.
Black One was still smiling, and Liu Ziyang also became carefree.
“Come with me. I’ll look for you… Aiya!”
Before Liu Ziyang could finish his sentence, Black One suddenly attacked.
Liu Ziyang was attacked and turned into an afterimage. When he reappeared, he was already behind Black One.
“You scared me to death.. If I hadn’t activated my skill in time, I would have fallen into your trap!”

                    



Chapter 101: Eight Doors, Eight Sceneries

Black One was still smiling, but it had turned into a sinister smile.
“Your skill is very strange, but…You’re not my match.”
Liu Ziyang was about to retort when he suddenly felt a few hands grabbing him. He turned around and realized that those people who were not wearing clothes were now pulling him.
Black One shouted, “Poisonous Dragon Drill!”
In Black One’s eyes, this attack was a sure death for this young man.
The Poisonous Dragon Drill missed, and Liu Ziyang turned into an afterimage again.
Liu Ziyang appeared behind Black One. This time, he didn’t hesitate and stabbed his dagger into the back of Black One’s neck.
“You…”
“I’m sorry, brother’s skill has two stages!”
When the women on the bed saw this scene, they all froze in place and did not move. However…Tears flowed down from his eyes…
On He Lingyue’s side, the door was opened. It was the surveillance room. Ten women were sitting neatly on chairs, staring at the screen.
Even when He Lingyue came in, these women didn’t even look at her. They just stared at the screen.
He Lingyue went forward to check and found that everyone’s eyes were bloodshot. Some people even had blood flowing out of the corners of their eyes.
This was caused by long-term fatigue. He Lingyue pulled the woman closest to her.
The woman was pulled to her feet, but she was still staring at the screen.
He Lingyue let go of her hand and the woman sat down again.
Looking at this absurd and strange scene, He Lingyue felt fear.
After searching for a while, he finally found the main power switch in the monitoring room and turned it off without hesitation.
All the screens went off, and the ten women immediately panicked. Some tugged at their hair, some trembled, until one of them rushed to the switch.
After turning on the switch, the women returned to normal and continued to sit in front of the screen and watch the surveillance.
He Lingyue shuddered. She didn’t want to stay in this environment anymore, so she immediately left the room.
Yang Qingzhuo opened the door and saw more than ten women lying inside.
These women didn’t have any reaction. Their eyes were closed, and it was unknown if they were sleeping.
‘ Sisters, don’t sleep anymore,” Yang Qingzhuo said.” I am here to save you.”” No one responded to Yang Qingzhuo. They all continued to sleep.
Yang Qingzhuo shook one of the women again, but no matter how hard he shook her, she did not open her eyes.
The atmosphere scared Yang Qingzhuo. He slowly backed away from the room.
“Ring, ring, ring!”
As he retreated, he bumped into a bell.
As soon as the bell rang, all the women who looked like they were about to die stood up. Their movements were so orderly that it was terrifying.
They sat up together, put on their clothes together, put on their shoes together, and went to the ground together. Their actions were surprisingly consistent. Yang Qingzhuo couldn’t stand the atmosphere anymore, so he turned around and ran out the door.
After running out, he turned around and saw that these women had actually followed him out and started cleaning the courtyard.
Yang Qingzhuo saw He Lingyue running out of another room. Both of them saw the horrifying scene. At midnight, a group of women were cleaning the yard mechanically.
Hao Ren was already nervous before he entered the house because it looked like a warehouse from the outside.
Hao Ren only said one sentence after he opened the door.
After saying that, he retreated and took a few deep breaths at the door. He gritted his teeth and opened the door again.
He retreated again, but in the end, he could not enter again.
This was a morgue…
Dong Fang pushed open the door and saw a man beating up the woman beside him.
“Hahaha, you b * tch, didn’t you always hide from me before?” This time, I’ll get Fourth Brother to bring you back. Let’s see if you’re still noble?”
The woman hugged her head and cried. Her head was broken, and the liquid that flowed down her arm could no longer be distinguished from tears or blood.
“Stop!” Dong Fang shouted.”
The man stopped and looked at Dong Fang, saying, “‘Who are you? She actually dared to enter my room. It looks like those b * tches who were watching the surveillance cameras deserve another beating.”
“I hate men who hit women the most.”
Dong Fang immediately launched an attack. Hei San was obviously not prepared enough and was pressed to the ground by Dong Fang.
However, Hei San was known for his speed. He escaped from Dong Fang’s restraints with a golden cicada shedding its shell.
Then, without hesitation, he ran out of the door. When he reached the door and saw that something was wrong, he immediately ran down the mountain!
When he returned to Moxiu’s side, Black Four saw Moxiu’s arrogant words and did not hold back. He used a skill to greet him.
Moxiu did not react. This was the first time Black Four had encountered a situation where his skills failed. He was a little flustered and directly threw two, three, and four skills at Moxiu.
MO Xiu slowly walked towards Hei Si. His right hand formed a claw and grabbed Hei Si’s head.
With a little force, Hei Si immediately knelt on the ground in pain. “Ah, let go. Who are you? Why is my skill useless against you?”
MO Xiu didn’t say anything. Instead, he looked at the woman on the bed.
The woman’s eyes were dull. She sat up subconsciously and put on her tattered clothes expressionlessly.
MO Xiu knew that this woman was hopeless. She had already been brainwashed by Hei Si.
Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but increase the strength in his hands.
Black Four’s scalp started to bleed, and his expression was twisted.
“Ah! Let go of me quickly. As long as you let go of me, I’ll do anything you want.”
MO Xiu still didn’t say anything. He just grabbed Hei Sit s head and walked out of the door.
At this moment, Dong Fang had just come out and shouted,’Quickly help me chase after him. This person is trying to escape!”
The others had all come out of their rooms. They glanced at MO Xiu and saw his gloomy face. Liu Ziyang and Yang Qingzhuo, who were the fastest, took the lead and chased after him.
MO Xiu dragged Hei Si from room to room. The first thing he saw was a woman who was cleaning the yard as if no one else was around.
MO Xiu tightened his right hand, and his five fingers had already touched Black Four’s skull.
Hei Si’s entire body trembled as he said, “Master…” Grandpa, let me go!”
In the next room, there were ten women in the surveillance room. Even though there was a huge commotion outside, they did not look out.
He exerted strength again, and his five fingers dug into the skull.
Hei Si was in so much pain that he couldn’t speak. His eyes were filled with disbelief. Where did this group of people come from?
When she walked past Black One, Black Two, and Black Three’s rooms, the women inside were all hopeless.
MO Xiu’s heart trembled. How could such a cruel thing exist in this world?
His skull was completely shattered, but Hei Si was still breathing.
The last one they passed was the room that Hao Ren had been guarding. Hao Ren opened the door.
It was filled with corpses, female corpses that were randomly placed all over the place. They did not rot and seemed to have been frozen. It should be the skill of one of the Hei brothers.
Looking at the dozens of corpses, MO Xiu felt very down. Why? Why didn’t anyone come to punish these four people before? They had caused so many innocent people to suffer.
Moxiu’s right claw clenched into a fist. Black Four fell to the ground, his eyes still open as he looked in the direction of the morgue.
At this moment, Liu Ziyang and Yang Qingzhuo caught Hei San.
“Boss, we’ve caught him. What should we do with him?” Liu Ziyang asked.”
MO Xiu didn’t even turn his head and roared,”Kill!”!!”
In the end, the woman in the cage was released. These people still retained their self-awareness, which was why they were locked up.
Fortunately, this mission saved some people.
He had thought that this was the door with the worst situation, but he didn’t expect it to be the only door with a chance of survival.
Eight doors, eight kinds of scenery, scenery cold people’s hearts..

Threads and rays of sunlight fell from the sky, faintly illuminating the entire Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   With the rise of the sun, the whole Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion gradually “came to life.”   Figures interweave.   On the not-so-wide streets.   The sound of hawkers could be heard from all directions.   “Lower-grade Thick Earth Amulets, a must-have for home protection! Five spirit stones each.”   “Spirit rice! Home-grown spirit rice, ten catties for one spirit stone!”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m   “Lower-grade demonic beast meat, two catties for one spirit stone!”   “…”action   Spring breeze carrying a hint of chill, pedestrians hurried through the streets.   The stall owners were all eagerly looking at the crowd, hoping for business to come their way.   He Song tightened his sleeves, his eyes scanning the crowd. He lingered at the spirit rice stall for a moment, before reluctantly shifting his gaze to the mortal rice placed next to it.   Spirit rice was tasty and could even increase cultivation.   But he was currently short on funds, so he must focus on satisfying his hunger first.   “Sir, please give me twenty catties of mortal rice.” He Song said when he arrived at the rice stall.   “Alright, two spirit sands.”   Spirit sand was a smaller currency compared to spirit stones. One spirit stone could be exchanged for a hundred spirit sands.   As for the mortal world’s silver or gold, they were worthless in the Cultivation World.   In the Cultivation World, as long as it contained spirit power, the smallest currency unit was spirit sand.   The rice seller was an old man who appeared aged and weak, but the spiritual pressure emanating from him still made He Song feel anxious.   Seeing that He Song only bought twenty catties of mortal rice, the old man didn’t say much, only putting the rice into a package and handed it to He Song.   He Song took out the two prepared spirit sands from his sleeve, and the exchange of money and goods took place.   Carrying twenty catties of rice, He Song finally felt somewhat relieved.   He didn’t even glance at the other stalls.   He turned around and walked towards the exit of the Stall Section.   “The first time out went quite smoothly.”   Carrying the rice, He Song walked and breathed a sigh of relief in his heart.   Although he had learned from his previous life’s memories that killings were prohibited in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, knowing was one thing, and arriving in a completely unfamiliar world still made him feel uneasy.   He Song was a transmigrator.   Three days ago, he had transmigrated into this world, taking over the body of a first-tier Qi Refining cultivator.   Fortunately, the previous owner of the body was also named He Song. After acquiring the previous life’s memories, He Song spent three full days at home, perfectly reproducing the previous life’s habits and various customs.   This was the Cultivation World.   Action of seizing bodies were quite common.            Concerned for his own life and property, He Song naturally wouldn’t step out of his house unprepared.   If he were discovered to have seized a body, he would probably be immediately hacked to death as an Evil Cultivator.   Now, after three days of imitating and reinforcing his memories, being certain that he wouldn’t be discovered, He Song finally went out to take his first proper look at the familiar yet unfamiliar Cultivation World before him.   He Song’s residence was not far from the Stall Section.   Carrying the rice, he walked for a while and returned home without finding anyone following him.   Close the door.   Lock it.   Leaning against the door.   He Song slowly exhaled.   “A lawful society is still better, at least I don’t have to worry about losing my life for some inexplicable reason.”   “But… if I hadn’t transmigrated, I should be thinking about how to surrender myself to get the best protection right now, right?”   “Eternal life isn’t easy to hide in modern society.”   Putting the bag of rice aside, a panel with black background and white text suddenly appeared in front of He Song, visible only to him.   “Name: He Song.”   “Lifespan: Infinite.”   Transmigrators have Golden Fingers.   This was an ordinary occurrence.   Having read a lot of novels, He Song wasn’t unfamiliar with the concept of Golden Fingers.   However, the panel with black background and white text in front of him wasn’t the kind of Golden Finger that could dominate the heavens, earth, and air.   Rather, its function seemed somewhat mediocre to He Song.   Infinite lifespan.   Eternal youth.   It sounds wonderful.   Many emperors and nobles in the mortal world have pursued longevity in their later years.   But… being at the very bottom of the Cultivation World and having such an ability with only first-tier Qi Refining seems somewhat useless.   From ancient times to the present, who are those who pursue longevity?   Emperors of the mortal world.   Renowned nobles.   Wealthy merchants.   A thousand-year-old aristocratic families.   These people have some things in common.   They hold high positions, enjoying the world’s finest, and wield great power.   As long as they continue to live, they can continue to enjoy their wonderful lives.   Has there ever been an ordinary person living at the bottom of society seeking longevity?   An elderly beggar seeking immortality, begging for ten thousand years?   A brothel woman seeking immortality, receiving guests in the brothel for ten thousand years?   A farmer seeking immortality, plowing the fields for ten thousand years?            A corporate worker seeking immortality, working hard and laying bricks for ten thousand years?   Are they so masochistic?   Even with immortality and infinite lifespan, one still needs to live.   One can die from injuries, poisoning, hunger, and illness.   And, eating costs money, medical treatment costs money, renting a house costs money, everything costs money.   Under such circumstances, an immortal being at the bottom of society would not be as wonderful as imagined.   Of course.   If they were royalty and nobles to begin with, it would be a different matter, as those seeking immortality are mostly royalty and nobles.   As such, this Golden Fingers seems somewhat useless in He Song’s eyes.   However, He Song is not discouraged.   In this world, there is one more thing that is heaven-defying compared to his previous life’s world.   Cultivating immortality!   Cultivating immortality is different from other things.   As long as you have the time and can continuously absorb spirit Qi into your body, your cultivation will gradually increase.   When your cultivation starts to increase,   Your social status, class, and strength will gradually improve.   At this moment, He Song’s cultivation is at the first-tier of Qi Refining, and his identity is at the very bottom of the Cultivation World.   But if he breaks through to the Foundation Establishment Stage, his status will instantly change dramatically.   As he moves up, He Song’s status will naturally change as well.   This is the truly heaven-defying thing!   As long as you live long enough, your social status will keep increasing, and no one would question or suppress it.   Strength is the foundation of all social statuses!   …   “Sigh, the most important thing now is to earn spirit stones.”   Shaking his head to cast away his thoughts, He Song let out a light sigh, then grabbed the rice bags and stood up.   He poured the rice from the bags into the nearly empty rice jar.   He Song looked at the now exceedingly familiar room before him. This was to be his home from now on.   The house was rented.   Ten spirit stones a month, which was not cheap.   For He Song right now, it was quite expensive.   The Immortal Pavilion never cared whether Loose cultivators could afford to rent a house.   Such expensive rent was also an Immortal Pavilion’s test for screening out qualified cultivators.   If you can’t even pay the rent, then leave the Immortal Pavilion and become a Loose cultivator.   Though the spirit Qi outside is thinner.   Though the outside world is more dangerous.   Though the mortality rate is higher outside.   But at least, there’s no need for such high rent.   After searching his person and the house for a while, He Song finally stared at the thirty-odd spirit stones on the table and fell into deep thought.   If he just paid the rent,   These spirit stones could be enough for three months.   But if he added food and drink, along with the expenses of learning a skill, He Song felt that he might be kicked out right away.        

2 Chapter 2: Spirit Rain Skill Translator: 549690339 What can more than thirty spirit stones be used for?   They can buy six Thick Earth Amulets.   They can buy three hundred catties of spirit rice.   They can buy sixty catties of low-grade demonic beast meat.   And then, there’s nothing left!   If he really bought these things, he might not even be able to afford a meal.   In order to not be kicked out of the house and starve to death,   quickly learning a craft that can earn money has become He Song’s top priority.   Following his past life’s memories, He Song started rummaging through the house again.   When he returned to the only table in the room, several more items appeared before him.   Two wrinkled Thick Earth Amulets.   A copy of “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill.”   A cultivation skill for reaching the ninth-tier Qi Refining, “Thick Earth Formulas.”   In addition to the more than thirty spirit stones already on the table.   These items,   now became He Song’s entire fortune.   “In my previous life, I finally left the countryside and settled in the city. After crossing over, do I need to start farming again?”   Looking at the “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill” in front of him, He Song’s doubtful expression flashed by.   He was not unfamiliar with farming, as he was a rural child in his previous life and was familiar with farming techniques through constant exposure.   But who would have thought that after crossing into a cultivator, he would need to pick up his previous life’s farming skills again?   In the Cultivation World, those who make a living growing spirit rice or other spirit plants are collectively called spiritual plant farmers.   Income for spiritual plant farmers is not high, but it is relatively stable.   As long as the spirit plants are properly cared for, there will be a decent income every year.   For low-level cultivators, this is a good path.   The “Spirit Plant Cultivation Skills” found in his room was obtained by his predecessor with the intention of becoming a spiritual plant farmer.   After contemplating for a moment,   He Song picked up the “Spirit Plant Cultivation Skills” on the table and began to browse through it.    The book only recorded two types of spirit plants cultivation methods and two skill cultivation methods.   “Spirit Rice cultivation method.”   “Golden Bamboo cultivation method.”   “Spirit Rain Skill.”   “Spirit Arrow Skill.”   Spirit rice, when mature, can be harvested as spirit rice, which is the staple food for cultivators.   Golden Bamboo on the other hand is a specialty of Bamboo Mountain Market, as hard as iron and can be used for refining artifacts, but has a long growth period.   Spirit Rain Skill is a skill that uses spirit power to irrigate spirit plants.   The Spirit Arrow Skill is a skill to kill pests in spirit plant gardens.   Apart from this, the “Spirit Plant Cultivation Skills” also indicate that once the Spirit Rain Skill and Spirit Arrow Skill are learned and the book is thoroughly studied, one can apply to become a spiritual plant farmer in Bamboo Mountain Market. The market will distribute a five-acre spirit field and corresponding spirit plant seeds for free.   However, once you become a spiritual plant farmer in Bamboo Mountain Market, all the spirit plants produced will be purchased at 30% of the market price.   The market price of one hundred catties of spirit rice is ten spirit stones, and the purchase price of Bamboo Mountain Market will be three spirit stones for one hundred catties.   With such a commission, even if the yield per acre of spirit rice is as high as a thousand catties, a spiritual plant farmer working hard for a year in a five-acre spirit field would only bring an income of about 150 spirit stones.   With an annual income of 150 spirit stones, 120 spirit stones would be needed for rent if living in the market, so the majority of their income would be spent there.   After a year of hard work, and after deducting rent, only thirty spirit stones would be left in the balance.   This really is… you make money in the market, and you spend it in the market, never taking any of it back home.   However, even so, if one wants to stay in the market, the profession of a spiritual plant farmer is still very attractive.   For no other reason…   First, it was because there were Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators stationed in the market, making it very safe.   Second, the concentration of spirit Qi in the market was much stronger than outside, making cultivation faster.   “Forget it, let’s focus on surviving first. I’ll make less money, but my lifespan is unlimited, and as long as I absorb spirit Qi during the Qi Refining stage, I’ll become stronger. Since the market is safe and secure, and the cultivation speed is faster than outside, I’ll stay here for now.”   After carefully reading the “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill” book, He Song made a decision.   He soon immersed himself in the knowledge brought by the book.   Methods of cultivating spirit rice.   Methods of cultivating Golden Bamboo.   Spirit Rain Skill.   Spirit Arrow Skill.   As He Song glanced through, insights emerged one after another in his mind, like a gushing spring.   Since he had experience cultivating rice in his previous life, He Song quickly grasped the cultivation methods for spirit rice.action    Ultimately, spirit rice was just rice containing spirit Qi. Compared to ordinary rice, it actually shared some similarities.   However, spirit rice required nourishment of spirit fields and needed to be irrigated with the Spirit Rain Skill.   After completely understanding the cultivation method for spirit rice, He Song quickly began practicing the Spirit Rain Skill and Spirit Arrow Skill.   The cultivation methods for spirit rice and Golden Bamboo only needed to be understood.   The Spirit Rain Skill and Spirit Arrow Skill were the keys to becoming a spiritual plant farmer!   Without these two skills, even if you were familiar with the cultivation methods, you couldn’t grow qualified spirit rice and Golden Bamboo.   It took a considerable amount of time to practice skills.   Although He Song immersed himself, his cultivation level was too low, and he still needed to eat.   As the sky darkened, He Song was finally awakened by hunger.   Looking out the window, He Song felt slightly surprised.   Unknowingly, he had immersed himself in cultivating skills for an entire day.   If it weren’t for the hunger in his stomach waking him up, he might have continued to immerse himself.   “Is this a skill from the Cultivation World? Channeling the spirit power within the body, forming hand seals, and casting spells can produce various miraculous effects.”   As the method of casting the Spirit Rain Skill flashed in his mind, He Song sighed in admiration, his body unconsciously channeling the spirit power within him and began forming hand seals.`,   It was a subconscious action.   Just like a child who had just received a new toy and wanted to try it out.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m   Learning a new skill in just half a day was impossible for ordinary cultivators.   Even though the Spirit Rain Skill was simple, for a first-tier Qi Refining cultivator to cast it perfectly, it would still take ten days to half a month of practice.   However, in the next moment,   Buzz!   He Song felt a tingling sensation on his scalp.   When he looked up, he was shocked.   At this moment, a tiny cloud, similar to a mist, was floating quietly above He Song’s head.   As He Song’s gaze swept across, wisps of moisture began to diffuse from the tiny cloud above his head.   Drip!   When the first drop of Spirit Rain fell from the cloud onto He Song’s face, he was awakened once again.   This is the Spirit Rain Skill!   Although the cloud above his head was tiny, the spirit power it contained was genuine.   It was just that since it was He Song’s first time casting it, and he wasn’t proficient, the cloud formed by the skill was extremely small.   But, Spirit Rain Skill is still Spirit Rain Skill!   Once it’s cast, it means that he has entered the door. All he needed to do next was to practice slowly, and he would soon be able to cast the normal Spirit Rain Skill that could cover several acres of spirit fields.   The tiny cloud created by the Spirit Rain Skill above his head quickly dissipated.   But He Song’s heart was filled with intense excitement.

3 Chapter 3: 1 Month Translator: 549690339 One day!   Just a short day’s time!   He had successfully practiced the Spirit Rain Skill, one of the two skills recorded in “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill”!   Although the Spirit Rain Skill is just a beginner’s skill for spiritual plant farmers and has a very low difficulty in cultivation.   But generally, it takes spiritual plant farmers ten to fifteen days to perfectly practice this skill.   And for him? It only took one day to be able to practice it.   Although the Spirit Rain Skill he practiced was just a cloud the size of a palm, this progress still astonished and delighted He Song.   When his previous self practiced skills, he hadn’t made so much progress as he does now.   Could it be because of transmigration that his soul is stronger than his previous self, and thus his skill cultivation progress has been increased?   A guess flashed through his mind.   He Song looked at the “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill” in his hand, and his gaze changed a little at this moment.   If this is true.   Then his future path of cultivating immortality might be much smoother than he had imagined!   “Let’s eat first. After diligently practicing these two skills for a few days and thoroughly mastering them, I’ll go to Bamboo Mountain Market to apply to be a spiritual plant farmer.”   “Only after becoming a spiritual plant farmer can I truly settle down.”   Putting down the book in his hand, He Song turned around to cook.   …   Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, twenty quiet days have passed.   Early morning.   The golden sunlight streamed through the window and fell on He Song’s body.   When his body became warm, He Song opened his eyes timely.   “Spiritual Arrow Skill!”   A flash of brilliance in He Song’s eyes, he made a hand gesture and practiced the skill, his spirit power mobilizing within his body. Soon, a spiritual light as thick as a chopstick appeared between his fingers.   The spiritual light swirled like a sword’s edge.   This was a spiritual arrow condensed from He Song’s internal spirit power.   With just a thought, the spiritual arrow in his fingers shot out.   Like a mundane arrow, the spiritual light shot straight from He Song’s fingers. In the blink of an eye, it pierced through the floor of the room, leaving a bottomless small pit in the soil beneath the floor.    Puffing sound.   With a slight noise, He Song looked at the bottomless pit in front of him and secretly marveled.   This power.   It’s probably comparable to a handgun, right?   If it hit someone, it would probably pierce them through.   Moreover, once the Spiritual Arrow Skill was proficiently practiced, the consumption of internal spiritual power would not be significant. It was truly a skill used for driving pests in the fields and could be practiced repeatedly in a short time.   Although the Spiritual Arrow Skill has a smaller power compared to other skills, it is enough for the sole purpose of driving pests.   Seeing the power of the Spiritual Arrow Skill, He Song stood up with satisfaction.   At this moment.   It had been twenty days since He Song started seclusive cultivation of the Spirit Rain Skill and Spiritual Arrow Skill.   During these twenty days, He Song thought that his speed of practicing skills would be much faster than his previous self.   However, after a twenty-day comparison, He Song had to admit a fact.   His speed of practicing skills was indeed much faster than his previous self.   But it wasn’t much faster.   For either the Spirit Rain Skill or the Spiritual Arrow Skill, ordinary cultivators would need about half a month of practice to properly cast them without losing power.action   His previous self was probably in the same range.   However, now he only needed twenty days to practice both skills to the point where they can be normally cast without losing power.   After all this, He Song found that his skill talent had indeed improved, but this improvement was still within the normal range.   “Perhaps it is because I am a transmigrator, and after absorbing the memories of my previous life, my soul is stronger than that of my predecessor.”   He Song thought to himself.   A strong soul is indeed very beneficial for the cultivation of skills.   Even in the traditional Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, after the soul becomes stronger, the speed of cultivation naturally comes faster than that of others.   Such as elixir refinement, amulet making, weapon training, Array Skills, and so on.   These are advantages for those with stronger soul power and stronger perception.   However, at this moment, He Song did not yet have the ability to cultivate these skills, so he could only guess in his heart and not put it into practice.   …   After breakfast.   He Song took all his belongings and opened the door for the second time.   The morning sun brought a touch of warmth to He Song’s body.    The row of houses in front, built like matchboxes, made He Song’s mood slightly heavy.   But soon, the heaviness in He Song’s heart disappeared.   Clenching his fists.   Feeling the Spirit Rain Skill and Spirit Arrow Skill that could be released at any time, a faint smile appeared on He Song’s face.   He went out today not for other purposes.   It was just to apply to become a spiritual plant farmer in Bamboo Mountain Market.   Once he became a spiritual plant farmer in Bamboo Mountain Market, he would be part of the Bamboo Mountain Market family.   The change of identity would greatly increase He Song’s security in Bamboo Mountain Market.   At least, without deliberately offending people, basically, no one would target him specifically.   Turning back to close the door, He Song quickly chose a direction based on the memory of his previous life and walked towards the place where he could apply to become a spiritual plant farmer.   Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   When He Song arrived here following his memory, there was only an old man on duty in the pavilion.   At this moment, the old man was holding a book, reading it with great interest, and put it down when he saw someone coming.   “Sir, I have already learned the Spirit Rain Skill and Spirit Arrow Skill and have read the “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill” thoroughly. I am here today to apply to become a spiritual plant farmer.”   He respectfully saluted the old man in front of him.   He Song called himself a junior in his mouth.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m   Elder Meng was named Meng Guan, with a cultivation base at the sixth-tier Qi Refining stage. He is one of the administrators of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion’s Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   He was responsible for recruiting spiritual plant farmers and distributing spirit rice and golden bamboo seeds.   According to the memory of his previous life, the “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill” on his previous life’s body was obtained from him.   The path of being a spiritual plant farmer was also given by Meng Guan.   Otherwise, with the first-tier Qi Refining cultivation base of his previous life, there was little hope of getting the book “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill.”   “It’s you. Good, it’s only been a month, and it seems that you haven’t been lazy in practicing your skills. It was worth my effort.”   After taking a serious look at He Song, who was saluting him respectfully, Meng Guan slightly nodded and praised him.   But soon, he changed the topic and said.   “Come, show me your full strength in using the Spirit Rain Skill and Spirit Arrow Skill. If you pass the test, you will be a spiritual plant farmer under the jurisdiction of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.”   In order to become a spiritual plant farmer, one must pass the test of Spirit Rain Skill and Spirit Arrow Skill.   Only when these two skills are mastered and can be used normally without losing their power, can one become a spiritual plant farmer.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion’s Spiritual Medicine Pavilion is not a charity. There must be a threshold for entry.   “Yes, Sir.”   He Song once again cupped his hands towards Meng Guan, and a flash of brilliance appeared in his eyes, his fingers forming a seal.   Soon, a cloud of Spirit Rain that could envelop several acres of spirit fields condensed.   As the gentle Spirit Rain fell, wisps of spirit Qi were attracted and merged into the rain, seeping into the ground, and finally dispersing into the soil.

4 Chapter 4: Spiritual Plant Farmer Translator: 549690339 The Spirit Rain Skill is the process of attracting the spirit Qi in the air and infusing it into rainwater.   Once it falls to the ground, it is then absorbed by the spirit plants.   Seeing He Song execute the Spirit Rain Skill, Meng Guan standing nearby nodded slightly in approval.   He Song’s execution of the Spirit Rain Skill was quite impressive, it was clear he had poured in much hard work.   The Spirit Rain Skill test was passed.   “Alright, stop now, don’t disturb the others.”   “Go ahead and demonstrate the Spirit Arrow Skill.”   At Meng Guan’s voice, faintly aged, reaching his ears, He Song immediately stopped casting.   Even though the Spirit Rain Skill is practical, its application depends on the location.   The Spiritual Medicine Pavilion is within the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, and any act of killing is prohibited inside the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Casting skills is allowed, but if the mana fluctuations are too intense and attract the Law Enforcement Team, one might be treated as an Evil Cultivator.   However, since there are people often applying to become spiritual plant farmers at the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion,   The spirit power fluctuations caused by the Spirit Rain Skill and Spirit Arrow Skill are very gentle, so there’s no need to worry about attracting the Law Enforcement Team.   Once again, with Meng Guan’s command,   He Song’s hand signs suddenly changed.   “Spirit Arrow Skill!”   Muttering in his mind and activating the spirit power within his body, a spirit arrow made of condensed spirit power quickly appeared between He Song’s fingers.   The chilling light flickered, like a sword’s light, showing that He Song had fully harnessed the power of the Spirit Arrow Skill.   All it was waiting for was a command from He Song’s mind to be unleashed.   “Well done, well done.”   “You’re a hardworking one, you’ve really learned these two skills in just one month without any hesitation.”   Seeing He Song master both skills to a degree where he could demonstrate them without losing any potency, satisfaction colored Meng Guan’s eyes as he gazed at He Song.   A month ago, as part of his search for spiritual plant farmers, he randomly picked a first-tier Qi Refining loose cultivator who had just entered the Cultivation World and granted him the book “Spirit Plant Cultivation Skills”.   Originally, this act was just an afterthought.   He had no expectations for any feedback.   He had done this many times over the years.    But who would have thought that a month later, the afterthought would bring him such a pleasant surprise.   He Song’s hard work surprised him and also made him develop a bit of goodwill towards He Song.   He Song didn’t waste a single moment of the unintentional favor he had bestowed upon him.   Such an attitude pleased him very much.   “Thanks to Sir’s guidance, I did my best.”   Facing Meng Guan’s praises, He Song could only reply respectfully.   What else could he say?   Could he say that he learned the two skills in only twenty days, and the rest ten days, he only passed three days while he hadn’t yet crossed over for the remaining seven days?   This was not something he could say.   But at this moment, Meng Guan was very excited.   Even He Song’s words didn’t dampen his good mood at all.   “Good, not arrogant or impatient, you have the potential to be a spiritual plant farmer.” Meng Guan stroked his meticulously groomed beard, his gaze on He Song more amiable.   “Come, since you’re so hardworking and have such a pure heart, from now on you will be the spiritual plant farmer of my Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.” Saying this, Meng Guan got up and walked to the backyard.   He Song quickly followed.   In the backyard, Meng Guan first provided He Song with two sets of clothes specifically for spiritual plant farmers.   Then he gave him a small bag filled with spirit rice seeds.   After doing all these, Meng Guan led He Song out of the backyard and specially designated five acres of spirit field for him.   He Song would be responsible for the five-acre spirit field from now on.   If he made a breakthrough in cultivation, he could continue to apply for more spirit fields from here.action   After becoming a spiritual plant farmer under the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, each time he made a cultivation breakthrough, he could apply for more spirit fields to cultivate.   As his cultivation level improved and his inner spirit power increased, the spirit fields he could manage would naturally grow.   This would allow the spiritual plant farmer to earn more spirit stones.   This is why so many people strive to become spiritual plant farmers.   The income of a spiritual plant farmer was not static, the more spirit fields they cared for and the higher the tier of the spirit plants they grew, the higher their income.   If well done, this could be a smooth path to the Foundation Establishment Realm.   However… it requires time to grind away at.   The number of spirit stones one could acquire each year was just too few.   He Song was already immortal, so naturally, he need not worry about time.    The path of a spiritual plant farmer is indeed suitable for him.   A moment later.   After bidding farewell to Meng Guan, He Song quickly arrived at the location of his five-acre spirit field according to the map given to him by Meng Guan.   It was not far from Bamboo Mountain Market, you could say it was right next to Bamboo Mountain Market.   Spirit fields, naturally, need to be nourished by spirit Qi.   Only with the density of spirit Qi around the market could spirit fields be nourished.   If it were further away, the density of spirit Qi would not be enough, and it would be impossible to form spirit fields.   It is fair to say that wherever there are spirit fields, the density of the spirit Qi would not be low.   Naturally, it would not be too far from the market.   “The distance from here to where I live is not far, and there is a main road connecting them, so I believe there will be no issues with safety.” Looking at the figures coming and going on the main road behind him, He Song felt reassured.   “It seems all the surrounding spirit fields have already been planted with spirit rice seeds, it is now spring, time to start farming.” Looking around, He Song raised an eyebrow, as if he had figured something out.   “Presumably, the reason why Sir Meng Guan gave out the “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skills” a month ago was also to account for this, as this is the time for spring plowing.”   As thoughts flashed through his mind, He Song suddenly found that his predecessor’s luck seemed quite good.   Just after he had guided Qi into his body and entered the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion from the Mortal World, he encountered Meng Guan looking for a spiritual plant farmer before spring plowing, and he then step by step walked on the path of the spiritual plant farmer.   If his predecessor had not encountered Meng Guan, he feared that he would have been left clueless after his arrival.   But He Song quickly cast aside these thoughts from his mind.   The most important thing now is to farm!   With a wave of his hand, strands of spirit power sprinkled all the spirit rice seeds in his hand throughout the five-acre spirit field.   He sowed the spirit rice seeds.   Then he used the Spirit Rain Skill, covering all five acres of spirit field he managed.   He let the spirit rain fall, watering the spirit field.   Threads of spirit Qi quickly gathered into the Spirit Rain Skill and fell into the spirit field, beginning to nourish the spirit rice seeds.   Stimulated by the spirit Qi, the spirit rice seeds in the spirit field also underwent miraculous changes at this moment.   Half an hour later.   He Song, dripping with sweat, stopped using the Spirit Rain Skill.   As a support skill, the Spirit Rain Skill actually consumes a small amount of spirit power, but He Song’s cultivation is low, only at first-tier Qi Refining.   Under such circumstances, maintaining the Spirit Rain Skill for half an hour exhausted all of He Song’s spirit power within his body.   Even so, there was no hint of despondency on He Song’s face.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com   That’s the life of a spiritual plant farmer.   The growth of spirit rice requires the spiritual plant farmer to use the Spirit Rain Skill every day for half an hour, in addition to making sure the spirit field isn’t attacked by pests, only then could one grow spirit rice within a year.   The complexity of such cultivation results in the high price of spirit rice.

5 Chapter 5: The Fierce and Strong Man Translator: 549690339 In the normal market.   A spirit stone is worth ten catties of spirit rice.   One acre of spirit field can produce a thousand catties a year, so a thousand catties of spirit rice would require a hundred spirit stones.   Five acres of spirit field can produce five thousand catties per year, so five thousand catties of spirit rice would require five hundred spirit stones to buy.   With such exorbitant prices, only family disciples and sect disciples can afford to eat spirit rice every day.   For a spiritual plant farmer like He Song.   Even the spirit rice he grows himself, he can’t afford to eat.   Of course, the reason he can’t afford it is that he has become a spiritual plant farmer under the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, the Immortal Pavilion takes a seventy percent commission, it isn’t because he grows it on his own spirit field.   If one were to grow spirit rice on their own spirit field.   The requirements are too many, and the current He Song simply can’t afford it.   First, you need a piece of spirit land with abundant spirit qi.   Secondly, you need the power to defend against Evil Cultivators.   Apart from this, the danger of a spirit field outside the Immortal Pavilion also greatly increases, if you want to go it alone without sufficient cultivation base, you are likely to die miserably.   It’s for these reasons that He Song chose to become a spiritual plant farmer under the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Although after becoming a spiritual plant farmer under the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, the Immortal Pavilion takes a high commission.   But the safety is unquestionable.   And it can also ensure that He Song will not be bullied for no reason within the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Now he only needs to put on the clothes of a spiritual plant farmer under the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, and he becomes one of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion’s own, he has a backing.   Planting the spirit rice seeds.   He Song thought for a while and changed into the clothes of the spiritual plant farmer again.   After scanning the spirit field and not finding any issues, He Song appeared on the main road and headed towards the interior of the Immortal Pavilion.   Becoming a spiritual plant farmer under the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   He Song’s identity immediately changes.   From being a humble Loose cultivator at the first-tier of Qi Refining.   To a spiritual plant farmer of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, under the governance of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   It may be just a change in status, but the effects are immediately apparent.action   On the way home from the spirit field, familiar faces started to greet him friendlily.    He Song also followed his predecessor’s style and responded one by one.   As He Song was about to open his door when he got home.   The door of the neighbor’s house opened at this moment, and a robust, fierce-eyed young cultivator walked out.   At first, this man didn’t take notice of He Song’s presence.   But when he glanced at He Song inadvertently and found the clothing on He Song somewhat familiar, he finally looked up at He Song.   “I’m Lin Cong, I haven’t seen you before, friend. Did you just move in recently?”   Seeing He Song in a uniform exclusive to the Immortal Pavilion’s internal staff, Lin Cong looked a little surprised.   It seemed he did not expect to see this uniform here.   The uniform exclusive to the Immortal Pavilion’s internal staff was not something everyone could wear.   In the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, it is best to avoid those wearing this uniform as far as possible.   Not for any other reason.   It’s just that if something happens, the people from the Immortal Pavilion will definitely favor the other side.   At that time, even though nothing happened, it might still turn into a life-threatening incident.   So even though He Song’s cultivation base is only at the first-tier of Qi Refining, Lin Cong did not underestimate him when he saw this.   “So it’s Mr. Lin, I am He Song. I’ve been living here for almost a month, but I’ve been keeping a low profile and rarely go out, which might have made you feel strange.”   Seeing the other party greet him, He Song naturally would not neglect him, he bowed slightly and returned a smile.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m   Lin Cong, robustly built and with eyes full of fierceness, his whole body muscular and the overwhelming spiritual pressure he exuded, made He Song feel a breath of murderous intent coming over his face as soon as he looked at him, making him hold his breath.   Quite the burly man.   Marvelled He Song in his heart.   “Looking at Mr. He’s outfit, it seems like you’re working inside the Immortal Pavilion?”   Seeing He Song stopped to respond to him, Lin Cong’s face became amiable too. He inquired.   “I just joined the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion today. I’m a spiritual plant farmer under the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.”   He Song nodded at him.   Spiritual plant farmers under the jurisdiction of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion could indeed be regarded as internal personnel of the Immortal Pavilion. The cultivators of the Immortal Pavilion wouldn’t make it difficult for them either.   However, compared to the likes of the Law Enforcement Team who wield the power of life and death over loose cultivators, they were of relatively low status.   “Oh? Congratulations, you’re quite lucky, Mr. He.”   Upon hearing this, Lin Cong congratulated him. The gaze he looked at He Song with immediately carried a trace of envy.   The Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion might not be big.   But it does have Foundation Establishment cultivators stationed.    The Foundation Establishment cultivator at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was dispatched from the Green Wall Immortal City.   And the Green Wall Immortal City was under the jurisdiction of the Golden Elixir Great Faction, the Thick Earth Sect.   The Foundation Establishment cultivator currently in charge at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was also a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   Thus, with one lead following another, He Song’s integration into the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion under the jurisdiction of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion can be regarded as having the backing of the Golden Elixir Great Faction.   Although it isn’t really of much practical use.   Pulling this name out, however, could intimidate quite a number of people.   A peripheral personnel of the Golden Elixir Great Faction.   Could any loose cultivator dare to offend him?   “You flatter me too much, Mr. Lin. I was just fortunate to become a spiritual plant farmer. I cannot compare to you.”   He Song noticed the envy in Lin Cong’s eyes and decided to practice the Spirit Rain and Spirit Arrow Skills, as well as join the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion as a spiritual plant farmer.   His approach is certainly much better than being a mere loose cultivator.   Lin Cong obviously wasn’t someone easy to deal with, yet he still looked at him with envy after learning of his identity.   For a common loose cultivator, I’m afraid there’s no hope of becoming a spiritual plant farmer, right?   He seemed to have some really good fortune in his previous life.   “Ah, you’re too modest, Mr. He. As a loose cultivator, I can only collaborate with other cultivators to hunt demonic beasts and sell their corpses for spirit stones. Compared to Mr. He in the Immortal Pavilion, my line of work is extremely dangerous.”   Shaking his head, the envy in Lin Cong’s eyes gradually faded away. He seemed to have thought of something halfway through, checked the time, and continued speaking.   “I have urgent matters to attend to, I’ll visit again next time. I must take my leave now.”   After a slight bow towards He Song, Lin Cong didn’t wait for a response and leapt away like a lightning bolt.   Watching Lin Cong’s swiftly retreating figure.   He Song, who had initially intended to be modest with him, was left in surprise.   This Lin Cong.   He surely is a thrill seeker.   He must’ve earned quite a few spirit stones by teaming up with people to hunt demonic beasts.   However, the money earned likely went mostly towards enhancing himself.   Otherwise, Lin Cong’s fierceness would not be so intense. His strength is obviously significantly stronger than the average cultivator.   But no matter how much Lin Cong earns, He Song remains completely uninterested.   Lin Cong did say one thing right.   Their profession is indeed too dangerous.   If they encounter a high-level demonic beast, they just need to run faster than their teammates.   The real fear is if someone in the team gets greedy or a more powerful cultivator targets them for their treasures.   When that time comes.   No matter how much spirit stones one earned, they would all profit someone else.

6 Chapter 6: Spirit Construction Pavilion Translator: 549690339 In He Song’s eyes, who had already achieved longevity.   Nothing is more important than safety.   Lin Cong’s path is not suitable for He Song.   Rather than struggling for life in the outside world, it’s better to practice steadily in the Immortal Pavilion.   The concentration of spirit Qi in the Immortal Pavilion is incomparable to the outside world.   When practicing in the Immortal Pavilion, the speed of cultivation is much faster than in the outside world.   This is why Loose cultivators want to enter the Immortal Pavilion, and why the rent in the pavilion is so expensive.   Spirit Qi.   It’s never free.   Shaking his head.   He set aside the idea of going out and risking his life.   He Song opened the door and entered the room.   First, he made himself a meal, and then began to meditate and practice Qi Refining.   After using the Spirit Rain Skill for half an hour, there was very little spirit power left in He Song’s body at this moment.   Fortunately, the spirit Qi in the Immortal Pavilion was rich, and the speed of recovering spirit power was also extremely fast.   However, it still took He Song two quarters of an hour to completely restore the spirit power in his body.   Next was cultivation.   In the Early Stage of Qi Refining, one only needs to absorb the spirit Qi of heaven and earth in an orderly manner in order to increase one’s own amount of spirit power.   Once reaching a certain limit, you can break through to the next stage.   For example, breaking from the first tier of Qi Refining to the second tier is achieved by orderly cultivation, and there is no bottleneck during the breakthrough.   It’s only when breaking through from the Qi Refining Early Stage to the Qi Refining Mid Stage,   Or from the Qi Refining Mid Stage to the Qi Refining Late Stage, that a bottleneck will appear.   Many cultivators get stuck in the Qi Refining Early Stage for decades and make no progress.   There are also many cultivators who struggle in the Qi Refining Mid Stage and can’t break through to the Late Stage no matter what they do.   Take Meng Guan of Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, for example, who has been stuck at the sixth tier of Qi Refining for several years, and has been unable to break through to the seventh tier. This is why he was sent to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and became a minor administrator.   The existence of these bottlenecks.    It’s a manifestation of the aptitude of cultivators.   In this world, possessing Spirit Roots allows one to introduce Qi into the body to become a cultivator.   Spirit Roots also have levels.   Five Spirit Roots of Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.   Those with all five elements are considered to have false spirit roots and belong to the poorest category in terms of aptitude.   Missing one of the five elements makes four spirit roots, which is much better than false spirit roots in talent.   Missing two elements results in three spirit roots. With a fast cultivation speed, they become the backbone of the various major families and sects.   Missing three elements results in the Earth Spirit Root. It has a faster cultivation speed than the three spirit roots and is considered a good seedling that no major family or   cultivated inetrnal energyccording to which attribute the spirit root belongs to, one can choose to cultivate that particular method.   For example, He Song, who has four spirit roots of Gold, Wood, Fire, and Earth, has no trouble cultivating the thick earth formulas of earth attribute.   However, if someone gave He Song a water attribute method, despite having four spirit roots, he wouldn’t be able to cultivate it.   The reason is simple: He Song lacks the water attribute spirit root.   There is also a distinction between the spirit roots themselves.   Spirit power affinity is an extremely important factor.   The higher the spirit power affinity, the faster the cultivation speed.   For example, He Song, who has Gold, Wood, Fire, and Earth spirit roots, has the highest affinity for earth spirit power after testing.   Therefore, He Song can cultivate the earth attribute Thick Earth Formulas fastest.   Once he starts cultivating the Gold, Wood, and Fire attributes, He Song’s cultivation speed will decrease accordingly.   In this case,   Being able to choose the most suitable cultivation skill becomes an important link for cultivators to cross the bottleneck.   If one can’t find the most suitable cultivation skill and has no other channels to obtain it, once the bottleneck is reached, they can only accept their fate and be tormented by the bottleneck to the point of desiring immortality and death.   Thinking about this,   He Song couldn’t help but sigh once again.   It seems that his previous life’s luck was really good.   His body had the highest affinity for the Earth Spirit Roots, and he was in the sphere of influence of the Thick Earth Sect. He easily purchased the Thick Earth Formulas which could be cultivated directly to the ninth tier of Qi Refining by just spending one spirit stone.   Now practicing the Thick Earth Formulas, he temporarily doesn’t have to worry about the issue of cultivation skills.   Following the path of the Thick Earth Formulas, He Song quickly plunged into cultivation.   He absorbed strands of spirit Qi, transforming them into his own spirit power. He Song’s spirit power inside his body began to grow gradually.    In the blink of an eye, a day and a night had quietly passed.   Not until He Song was starving did he open his eyes again.   One session of cultivation.   That’s a day and a night.   Feeling the slight increase of his cultivation, He Song calculated in his heart.   According to his current cultivation speed, it would take a full two years to raise his cultivation level to the second tier of Qi Refining.   It will take two years to break through from the first tier to the second tier of Qi Refining.   This cultivation speed is not slow.   On the contrary, it belongs to a relatively fast cultivation speed.   He Song’s Earth Spirit Root affinity is relatively high, faster than the average four spirits roots.   Although it’s not as fast as the cultivation speed of the three spirit roots, it’s still considered the best among the four spirit roots.   Besides that, it’s also because He Song is in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, a place rich in spirit Qi, which allows him to have such a cultivation speed.   If he was in a place with thin spirit Qi, He Song’s cultivation time would probably be even longer.action   “Not bad. It’s possible to break through to the second-tier of Qi Refining in just two years. This cultivation speed is much faster than that of an average four spirit roots cultivator.”   After finishing his practice, He Song was quite satisfied with his cultivation progress. Nodding his head, he began to cook right away.   At the moment, he was just a small cultivator at the first tier of Qi Refining and couldn’t be like those major cultivators who don’t need to eat or drink.   As for Inedia Elixir,   That stuff costs two spirit stones for a bottle of ten pills, and one pill only staves off hunger for ten days. For He Song, it’s still too extravagant for now.   The mortal rice he bought earlier is more suitable for a small cultivator like him.   Although it is a bit troublesome, but who can blame him as he only has about thirty spirit stones on him right now.   After eating,   He Song returned to the spirit field he is in charge of.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m   After using the Spirit Rain Skill for half an hour, He Song carefully observed the growth of the spirit rice seeds. After finding no abnormalities, he returned to the Immortal Pavilion.   Today,   It’s the day to pay the monthly rent.   On the first day of each month, all cultivators living in the Immortal Pavilion need to go to the Spirit Construction Pavilion under the Immortal Pavilion to pay the monthly rent.   Ten spirit stones per month, not a single one less.   If they can’t pay,   Loose cultivators would be immediately kicked out and relegated to the area outside the Immortal Pavilion with scarce spirit Qi to make a living.   Unless…   “Fellow Daoist, I see you have a new face, are you new working in the Immortal Pavilion?”

7 Chapter 7 Wei Fan Translator: 549690339 The moment He Song entered the Spirit Construction Pavilion in his spiritual plant farmer attire,   a voice rang out beside him.   Immediately after.   A young man, also wearing Immortal Pavilion internal clothing, appeared in front of He Song.   There was a smile in the man’s eyes, and when he looked at He Song, his gaze carried a hint of warmth, as if he was looking at a family member, making people feel warm and welcomed.   However, He Song could sense a strong spiritual pressure from the other party.   He thought, the cultivation level of this person must be much higher than his own.   Seeing this, He Song hurriedly clasped his hands in greeting.   “Indeed, my name is He Song, and I just became a spiritual plant farmer yesterday. It’s an honor to meet you, sir.”   He Song didn’t hide anything, but instead told the truth.   Having just become a spiritual plant farmer, he didn’t have anything coveted by others. Judging by the appearance of this person, he didn’t seem like someone looking for trouble.   He Song naturally wouldn’t hide anything.   “My name is Wei Fan, and I am the steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion. Since you are a spiritual plant farmer, you are also part of the Immortal Pavilion family, so there is no need for such formalities.”   A flash of understanding appeared in Wei Fan’s eyes.   As the steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, he personally received basically every internal member of the Immortal Pavilion who came to renew their lease.   He had also had contact with many spiritual plant farmers before, and since it was now the busy planting season and the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion had just recruited new ones, it did not surprise him.   “Mr. He, please follow me. There are rules for internal members of the Immortal Pavilion, so there’s no need to mingle with these loose cultivators.”   As Wei Fan spoke, he cast a disdainful glance at a group of loose cultivators in a long line on the other side, the contempt in his eyes flashing for just a moment.   Loose cultivators.   There was a significant gap between them and the internal members of the Immortal Pavilion.   For the sake of cultivation resources, loose cultivators could resort to extreme measures, which is why their mortality rate was always high.   On the other hand, internal members of the Immortal Pavilion had their respective talents, did not need to risk their lives, and therefore had a very low mortality rate.   When faced with a loose cultivator who could die at any moment,   and an Immortal Pavilion internal member with a unique skill and growing cultivation,   his attitude would naturally be completely different.    Even though spiritual plant farmers didn’t get many resources each year, they still wouldn’t die easily.   As time went on, perhaps a Qi Refining mid-stage or even a Qi Refining late-stage expert could emerge.   As for loose cultivators?   Perhaps just after befriending them, they could be dead within a few days.   There was no point in befriending such people; it would be a complete waste of time.   Following Wei Fan’s gaze, He Song saw a group of loose cultivators lining up to pay their spirit stones.   Unlike He Song, the loose cultivators paid at a single counter.   After handing over ten spirit stones, someone from the Spirit Construction Pavilion would take out a ledger to record the place of residence, signifying that they could continue living for another month.   As for the rooms of those who didn’t come to renew and pay their spirit stones, the Law Enforcement Hall would reclaim them.   Expecting to live for free?   There was no chance of that.   Following Wei Fan’s footsteps, He Song was quickly led into an ancient and elegant room.   The exquisite wooden furniture was neatly arranged, with strands of smoke curling up in the air.   The rich and lingering aroma of incense filled the room, causing He Song to feel a distinct sensation as soon as he stepped inside.   However, due to the exceptional security of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, He Song hesitated a little before he did not screen the scent out.   Caution was necessary depending on the situation and one’s identity.   His identity was now insignificant.   Moreover, they were inside the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   On top of that, Wei Fan’s cultivation was much higher than He Song’s.   If he continued to screen out the scent, it would risk making a fool of himself, which was undesirable.   Wei Fan didn’t notice anything unusual.   After guiding He Song to take their respective seats in the room, he slowly began to speak.   “Since you have just become a spiritual plant farmer and have no other income, I assume you’re here because of your financial situation.”   “To be honest with you, this situation is very common, and there is a solution. You only need to leave a trace of your aura, and from then on, you won’t need to come here every month. Once a year will suffice.”   As he spoke, Wei Fan turned over his hand, and a contract document appeared on the table in front of He Song.   “Please take a look, Mr. He.”   Wei Fan’s voice was neither slow nor hurried, and his words were fluent. It seemed that he had experienced many such situations before;   Apparently, there were quite a few Immortal Pavilion internal members with financial difficulties like He Song.    He Song gathered himself, bowed to Wei Fan, and only then picked up the contract document in front of him.   His eyes scanned over it,   and he immediately understood why Wei Fan was so adept at dealing with this situation.   Regulations were already in place on the contract document that only required joining the Immortal Pavilion and becoming an internal member. One could then use the annual salary issued by the Immortal Pavilion to pay the rent.   Although spiritual plant farmers didn’t receive an annual salary,   as long as there were no mistakes, the spirit rice harvested from the five-acre spirit field would be bought by the Immortal Pavilion, and there would be an income of 150 spirit stones each year.   After deducting the annual rent of 120 spirit stones, only 30 spirit stones would be left for He Song.   What this contract stated was the agreement that allowed internal members of the Immortal Pavilion to live first and pay the rent later when the annual salary was issued.   Once the aura left on the contract document, even if the cultivator wanted to default, they would be chased down by the Law Enforcement Team, and their debts forcibly settled.action   At that point, it would be fortunate if they didn’t die and only suffered severe damage.   It completely wiped out any thoughts of defaulting on their debts.   Paying on one’s own and having others forcibly drag one back to settle the debts would be an entirely different experience.   “If you agree, Mr. He, just leave your aura on the contract document.”   Wei Fan seemed confident that He Song would do this and wasn’t in a hurry. Instead, he simply stated his intention and then began to make tea.   As the unknown tea leaves began to swirl in the teapot,   He Song left his own aura on the contract document in his hand just as the first cup of tea was placed in front of him.   There was no problem with the contract.   It only changed the original method of prepayment to post-payment.   And from the original monthly payment to the current annual payment.   He Song would still have to pay the same amount of spirit stones, but now it was just more convenient for the Immortal Pavilion internal members.   “Thank you, my friend. This is a good tea.” Lifting the teacup, He Song took a light sip and praised.   Although he didn’t know much about tea, it would be impolite not to drink a cup and praise the tea since it was already placed in front of him.   Wei Fan was the steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, and his cultivation level was unknown, but it was higher than He Song’s.   With such a person making tea for him, He Song naturally wouldn’t be discourteous.   So even though he couldn’t tell the quality of the tea, He Song still praised it sincerely.   “Hahaha, Mr. He, there’s no need for that. My lifelong hobby is making friends. As long as you don’t mind this inferior tea, it’s all good.”   It seemed that Wei Fan could see what He Song was thinking, and he laughed.   Immediately after, he poured another cup of tea for He Song.   However, this time,   When he placed the tea in front of He Song, his voice rang out once more.   “Mr. He, do you know Meng Guan from the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion?”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

8 Chapter 8: Spirit Skill Pavilion Translator: 549690339 Spiritual Medicine Pavilion’s Meng Guan?   Upon hearing this, an image of the elder from the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion flashed in He Song’s mind.   In his previous life, he obtained the book “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skills”, thanks to Meng Guan.   Becoming a spiritual plant farmer himself was also due to Meng Guan’s favor.   Although, for Meng Guan, this matter might only have been trivial and within his duties, he owed him a favor, and that needed to be repaid.   Now he had arrived at the Spirit Construction Pavilion, with Wei Fan in front of him mentioning Meng Guan.   Could it be that there was a conflict between these two?   With many thoughts flashing through his mind, He Song thought for a moment and eventually decided to stick to his original plan.   Even if it meant offending Wei Fan in front of him, how could Wei Fan, who was in the Spirit Construction Pavilion, manage him, who was in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion?   At most, he would avoid coming to the Spirit Construction Pavilion in the future.   “Yes, this junior was able to become a spiritual plant farmer thanks to Elder Meng’s guidance and support. Otherwise, I might still be just a loose cultivator now,” He Song replied without any concealment.   As he spoke, He Song’s eyes flickered, and he was ready to leave at any time.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com   Inside the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, even internal staff members were not allowed to use force.   Once the Law Enforcement Team was alerted, not everyone could bear the charges of using force within the Immortal Pavilion.   Even if Wei Fan in front of him was a Steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, it was likely that he would not escape punishment.   “Fellow Daoist, you don’t need to be like this. It’s very safe within the Immortal Pavilion. Moreover, Meng Guan and I are from the same sect. I just wanted to ask about his recent situation,” Wei Fan said with a smile on his face, his gaze toward He Song becoming more friendly.   It was, after all, one of Meng Guan’s duties in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion to recruit new spiritual plant farmers. Naturally, he was aware of this.   In this way, He Song, who had just joined the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion as a spiritual plant farmer, must have been recommended by Meng Guan.   He had just asked the question to see what kind of character He Song had and whether or not he was worth befriending.   If He Song had subconsciously denied his relationship with Meng Guan, he probably wouldn’t be facing a friendly face at this moment.   But now the outcome was quite satisfactory, and naturally, he took a different view of He Song.   Seeing this, He Song was relieved.   Then the two began a conversation.   Through his previous inquiry, Wei Fan had an understanding of He Song’s character.   He Song, on the other hand, was more than happy to accept Wei Fan’s goodwill.   As both parties were interested in forming a bond, their relationship began to rapidly close in.            By the time He Song was personally escorted out of the Spirit Construction Pavilion by Wei Fan, the two were already addressing each other as brothers.   Leaving the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   He Song looked towards the direction of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Meng Guan, who had recommended him to join the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and become a spiritual plant farmer, should soon be able to treat him differently through Wei Fan, right?   In this way.   Within the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, he had the friendship of one Qi-refining mid-stage cultivator and one Qi-refining late-stage cultivator.   During their conversation, He Song learned that Wei Fan’s cultivation had reached the seventh-tier Qi Refining, which was stronger than Meng Guan’s sixth-tier Qi Refining.   Befriending Wei Fan and Meng Guan, although he might not achieve great success, at least, he wouldn’t be considered entirely rootless.   Once there was any news, He Song could learn about it in advance through Wei Fan and Meng Guan.   With this thought, He Song’s footsteps immediately became lighter.   He didn’t go home to cultivate.   Following his memory, He Song quickly arrived at the Stall Section within the Immortal Pavilion.   The last time he came to the Stall Section was when he went out for the first time to buy mortal rice.   Back then, He Song was very cautious, and after buying twenty pounds of mortal rice, he hurriedly left without even wanting to take a stroll around the Stall Section, fearing that he might be targeted by others.   But things were different now.   He Song, dressed as a spiritual plant farmer, had a status within the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion that ordinary loose cultivators couldn’t compare to.   Of course, there was no need to worry that buying a few things would draw unwanted attention.   This time when He Song came to the Stall Section, he took a good look inside.   “Low-grade Thick Earth Amulet, five spirit stones each, only thirteen left, limited supply.”   “Spirit rice, our homegrown spirit rice, ten jin for one spirit stone.”   “Inedia Elixir, two spirit stones per bottle.”   “Low-grade Artifacts at a loss, only eighty spirit stones each.”   “…”   He Song’s eyes swept across the various stalls as the sales pitches echoed around him.   There were stalls selling spirit amulets, and they also displayed amulet pens, amulet ink, amulet paper, and other such materials needed for amulet making. It looked both plentiful and varied.   There were also stalls selling Inedia Elixir, with rows of bottles and jars displayed. However, the contents were mostly comprised of common Inedia Elixir, and proper elixir refinement masters wouldn’t set up a stall here.   Others sold Artifacts, but looking at the rough and pitted appearances of the Artifacts, He Song could only imagine how much abuse they had endured.   He Song even saw the old man he had bought Spirit rice from last time.            At this moment, spirit rice kept flowing from the old man’s sleeves and quickly filled a cloth bag.   “Storage bags?”   Looking at the spirit rice pouring out from the old man’s sleeve, a term flashed across He Song’s mind.   “I didn’t expect an old man selling rice to have a storage bag.”   After looking a bit longer, He Song finally withdrew his gaze. Meanwhile, he felt a little more confident about his future as a spiritual plant farmer.   If an old man selling spirit rice could have a storage bag,   then in the future, he would definitely have one too!   He continued walking forward.   The stalls in front of He Song became more and more numerous, and the items being sold became increasingly diverse.action   With He Song’s experience, many of these items were completely new and unheard of to him.   However, he didn’t care too much.   Loose cultivators have a difficult time cultivating, and compared to disciples from sects and noble family members, their knowledge reserves are definitely lacking.   But the solution is simple.   Looking up,   He Song saw a huge plaque with just one glance.   “Spirit Skill Pavilion.”   This place was He Song’s goal for coming to the Stall Section this time.   During his conversation with Wei Fan previously, Wei Fan advised He Song to come to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to purchase some commonly used skills for cultivators.   At the same time, there are many books with basic cultivation knowledge inside the Spirit Skill Pavilion available for browsing.   These books charge fees for loose cultivators,   but for inner members of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, they are free of charge.   Only when buying skills, will the normal fees be charged.   Thus, for a novice like He Song who just entered the Cultivation World and has already become an inner member of the Immortal Pavilion, this place is a treasure trove.   Glancing at his outfit, which was exclusive to spiritual plant farmers, He Song stepped forward and entered the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   “This humble girl is Ping’er. Greetings, fellow daoist. May I ask what skill you are looking for?”   Just as He Song entered the Spirit Skill Pavilion, a gentle female voice sounded beside him.   Looking towards the source of the sound, He Song’s eyes brightened.   A beautiful female cultivator stood before him, smiling sweetly as she looked at him. The voice he had just heard had come from her mouth.   Female cultivators usually have quite attractive appearances. Cultivating immortality refines and cleanses one’s body, so most cultivators are good-looking men and women.   At present, He Song’s appearance was also quite impressive and handsome.   “I am He Song, greetings, fellow daoist. An elder asked me to come and choose a few basic skills.”        

9 Chapter 9 Choosing a Skill Translator: 549690339 He Song nodded slightly at Ping’er, expressing his needs.   After introducing Qi into the body and reaching the first-tier Qi Refining, cultivators are still at their weakest stage.   With too little spirit power in the body and no skills to protect themselves, cultivators at this stage are likely to face defeat even against a mortal warrior.   Therefore, after reaching the first-tier Qi Refining, cultivators usually choose several basic skills for protection and other purposes as soon as possible.action   He Song was previously unaware of this.   But after Wei Fan’s guidance, he understood the importance of these basic skills to himself.   That is why he came to the Spirit Skill Pavilion, wanting to learn a few basic skills.   He also intended to browse the books that recorded common knowledge of the Cultivation World in the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   This would help him gain a better understanding of the Cultivation World and fill in the gaps in his knowledge.   “Basic skills? Mr. He, please follow me.” Ping’er led He Song to another area after hearing his request.   They stopped in front of an unoccupied table.   A cup of hot tea was poured for He Song.   Waiting for a moment, Ping’er came back with a tray in her hand and placed it in front of He Song.   There were more than ten jade slips quietly placed on the tray, looking very enticing.   Putting down the tray, Ping’er picked up a jade slip from the tray and began her introduction.   “This is the Spirit Vision Skill, which allows you to check the cultivation level of others at any time, avoiding provoking the powerful.”   “This is the Fireball Skill, which can gather fireballs to kill enemies with formidable power.”   “This is the Sound Transmission Skill, the go-to choice for first-tier Qi Refining cultivators to communicate with friends over long distances. The speed is very fast, and it is almost impossible to intercept. If intercepted, the information will self-destruct, ensuring high security.”   “This is the Light Body Skill, which can increase one’s walking speed, essential for long journeys and escaping danger.”   “This is the Breath Concealment Formulas, which can hide one’s aura, making it almost undetectable by others.”   “This is the…”   As Ping’er introduced each skill, He Song’s eyes were full of wonder.   He wanted all of them!   These skills really are must-haves for every cultivator.   However, before coming to the Spirit Skill Pavilion, Wei Fan had specifically told He Song that there were three skills he must choose, and other basic skills could be purchased when he had more spirit stones in the future.   The three must-choose skills were:   One was the Spirit Vision Skill.   One was the Sound Transmission Skill.   And the other was the Breath Concealment Formulas.   With the Spirit Vision Skill, one can instantly detect another person’s cultivation level, avoiding attracting stronger opponents; unlike divine sense scanning, the Spirit Vision Skill only detects cultivation levels and does not acquire additional information, thus it is not perceived as intrusive.            Spirit Vision Skill is different from divine sense scanning; it is more like the Qi Observing Skill, allowing you to see the opponent’s cultivation level without causing annoyance.   On the other hand, divine sense scanning feels like being groped by a stranger—no one would like that.   So, in the Cultivation World, everyone accepts the use of the Spirit Vision Skill as normal and doesn’t mind, but using divine sense scanning is considered a major taboo.   The Sound Transmission Skill, after exchanging auras with a friend, allows cultivators to communicate with each other over long distances by releasing a paper crane or a bird. It is the preferred method of communication for Qi Refining cultivators.   Of course, if the other party is within a Defensive Array or has activated the Breath Concealment Formulas to hide their aura, the Sound Transmission Skill won’t be able to find them and will stop at the point where their aura disappeared.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience   Exchanging auras with a friend is like adding a friend; this small part of the aura can be used to contact the other party without worrying about being tracked.   If a special skill that changes one’s aura is used, the Sound Transmission Skill will become ineffective.   At the same time, if the Sound Transmission Skill is intercepted, the information it carries will be instantly destroyed, and the person who cast the skill will be notified.   The Breath Concealment Formulas are used to conceal one’s aura, making it nearly impossible for others to detect. It is the best option for hiding from calamity and avoiding danger.   Of course, the Breath Concealment Formulas can only shield detection; if someone sees you with their naked eye, they will still see that you exist.   The Breath Concealment Formulas merely hide one’s aura; they are not an invisibility skill.   Therefore, after using the Breath Concealment Formulas, if you don’t want others to find you, it’s best to hide and avoid being seen.   When using the Spirit Vision Skill to observe someone who has activated the Breath Concealment Formulas, it can’t see their cultivation level.   With the Spirit Vision Skill, cultivators can determine the level of others as long as they are not using the Breath Concealment Formulas.   “Each of these skills costs only ten spirit stones. Which ones do you need, Mr. He?” After introducing all the skills on the tray, Ping’er looked at He Song and asked softly.   The skills sold at the Spirit Skill Pavilion are all contained in jade slips, ensuring that there will never be issues with missing passages or unsuccessful cultivation.   After purchasing the jade slips, just attach them to your body and all the knowledge and techniques they contain will be instantly transferred to you.   Moreover, the jade slips also contain the previous cultivators’ experiences and insights related to these skills.   It’s enough to save a lot of detours for the first-time practitioner of this skill.   Such comprehensive service naturally can’t be cheap.   However, instead of searching for less expensive handwritten versions in the Stall Section, He Song preferred to buy the genuine product at the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   Not for any other reason.   It’s just out of fear of being cheated.   Not being able to practice with the handwritten version would be a minor issue. But if practicing caused an error, that would be a big problem.   However, the price of ten spirit stones for this skill made He Song feel a little pained.   His previous self had only spent one spirit stone to buy a set of Thick Earth Formulas that could be practiced up to ninth-tier Qi Refining.   Now he had to spend ten spirit stones to buy a single skill.   He only had over thirty spirit stones in total, and could at most learn three skills.   After learning the three essential basic skills for cultivators, he would only have a few spirit stones left.   Which would barely be enough to cover his food expenses for this year.   Really, the skill is so expensive that it is outrageous?   He Song’s hesitation quickly disappeared.            “I need the Spirit Vision Skill, Breath Concealment Formulas, and Sound Transmission Skill. Thank you, my friend.”   He Song nodded his head at Ping’er and handed over thirty spirit stones from his sleeve.   After receiving the spirit stones from He Song.   Ping’er picked out three jade slips from the tray and handed them to He Song.   “Simply attach the jade slip to your forehead.”   The gentle female voice came again.   Not saying anything else, He Song took out a jade slip and attached it to his forehead.   The next moment.   All the information about the Breath Concealment Formulas was firmly imprinted in He Song’s memory.   In just an instant, He Song thoroughly understood how to practice Breath Concealment Formulas and the various functions it would have after completion.   He did the same for the remaining two jade slips, and after completing all three basic skills, He Song opened his eyes.   It has to be said.   Using jade slips to learn skills is indeed very effective.   He Song, who had just learned three basic skills, didn’t feel tired at all. On the contrary, he felt refreshed, and the memories of the three basic skills in his mind seemed even deeper.   “If Mr. He needs anything else, please feel free to call me. Books on cultivation knowledge are on the shelf over there, Mr. He can browse them at will. I have some other matters to attend to, so I will take my leave first.”   Leaving behind those words, Ping’er’s figure disappeared.   First-tier Qi Refining, wearing the Immortal Pavilion internal staff’s clothing, and only purchasing three basic skills.   Such obvious characteristics had already given Ping’er some understanding of He Song.   According to her experience in attending to guests in the past, He Song was likely to spend time browsing some general knowledge books in the Spirit Skill Pavilion and wouldn’t leave so soon.   Perhaps, for the next few days, He Song would visit the Spirit Skill Pavilion every day.   But he wouldn’t buy any more skills.   Naturally, there was no need for her to attend to him.   “Thank you, Friend Ping’er.”   Bowing his hand to the departing Ping’er, He Song suppressed his urge to immediately return home and practice the three skills.   Walking to a nearby bookshelf, He Song casually picked up a book and started reading silently.   “Record of Spirit Plants”, “Record of Spirit Mines”, “Demonic Beast Pictures”, “Cultivator Realm Division”, “Thick Earth Sect’s Surrounding Power Distribution”…   One book after another was scanned by He Song’s gaze, giving him a rough understanding of the Cultivation World he was in.   He Song was currently in the Thick Earth Sect, a sect with the power of a Golden Core Realm.   Thick Earth Sect had jurisdiction over four Immortal Cities.   Each Immortal City had three to four affiliated Immortal Pavilions.   And where He Song was at this moment was in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, which belonged to one of the four Immortal Cities – Green Wall Immortal City.   Inside the Immortal Pavilion, there were Foundation Establishment disciples of Thick Earth Sect in charge, ensuring safety.   Apart from that, there were four other Golden Core Sects distributed around the Thick Earth Sect.   These Four Great Sects were the Golden Sword Sect, Pure Yin Sect, Jade Flower Sect, and Seven Star Sect.   Golden Sword Sect, Pure Yin Sect, and Jade Flower Sect were located to the east, west, and south, all being righteous sects.   Seven Star Sect was located north of Thick Earth Sect and was a Demonic Sect.        

10 Chapter 10: Sudden Change Translator: 549690339 Apart from the distribution of power around the Thick Earth Sect, He Song also learned about the sales of skills and cultivation techniques.   In the Cultivation World.   Cultivation techniques are not actually worth much.   High-level cultivators can create techniques at will, leading to a myriad of attributes in methods and their widespread availability.   Additionally, the general price of such techniques is usually around one hundred spirit stones, which isn’t particularly expensive.   However, within the sphere of influence of major sects and aristocratic families.   The methods of their sect or family become incredibly affordable, almost to a point where it’s hard to believe.   For example, the Thick Earth Formulas that He Song himself cultivated were created by a powerful member of the Thick Earth Sect and could be cultivated to Golden Elixir Perfection.   But within the sphere of influence of the Thick Earth Sect, a Thick Earth Formula that could be cultivated to the ninth-tier Qi Refining only required one spirit stone.   This situation is not uncommon.   Almost all the sects will act in this manner within their sphere of influence.   Mainly because there are many benefits to it.   First, almost all sects or aristocratic families will have back-up plans within their methods once cultivated to the Qi-refining late stage, requiring the purchase of unique resources within their sect in order to progress quickly.   Not buying them? Then watch as others advance rapidly while your own cultivation speed remains incredibly slow.   In this way, they can constantly extract spirit stones from loose cultivators.   Second, after cultivating the methods of their sect, if a loose cultivator happens to break through to Foundation Establishment, joining the sect becomes their best option.   No need to change their cultivation method, no need to abandon their hometown, and the sect even provides higher-tier methods as gifts.   In this way, the temptation for loose cultivators to build a foundation is enormous.   Third…   It is precisely because of these benefits that the Thick Earth Formulas become so cheap within the sphere of influence of the Thick Earth Sect.   Other techniques in the Spirit Skill Pavilion, however, require a hundred spirit stones per technique, which is relatively expensive in comparison.   As for skills.   Most skills are monopolized by sects and aristocratic families.   The skills that are put up for sale to loose cultivators naturally won’t be too profound.   Qi Refining stage skills are relatively complete in number because their power isn’t significant.    But once Foundation Establishment is reached, the chances of obtaining Foundation Establishment skills drop drastically.   Only by joining a sect or an aristocratic family can one have access to a complete set of Foundation Establishment skills.   However, even so, there are restrictions within the Transmission Jade Slip for Qi Refining stage skills that prevent the transfer of learned skills to others.   That’s why Ping’er didn’t instruct anything previously and just left.   Skills purchased can only be used by oneself.   As He Song read, he became deeply engrossed in the books before him.   Various common knowledge about the Cultivation World flooded into He Song’s mind, giving him a deeper understanding of the Cultivation World.   For several days in a row, He Song would come to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to read the books, other than performing the Spirit Rain Skill in the spirit field every day.   Naturally, he also became more familiar with this Cultivation World he was in.   …   This situation continued until a few days later.   On this day, a row of bright lights appeared beside He Song.   Like dancing yellow bean-sized lamps, they illuminated He Song’s surroundings.   Putting down the book in his hand, He Song contentedly turned his head and looked around.   At this moment.   The outside world was growing dim.   In the Spirit Skill Pavilion, numerous lamps lit up the large room, making it almost indistinguishable from daylight.   Seeing this scene, He Song didn’t bother to think; he immediately went towards the exit of the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   After a few days of reading, He Song had already finished examining all the books about the common knowledge of the Cultivation World inside the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   It could be said that He Song’s knowledge about the Cultivation World was now on par with family cultivators or even sect disciples.   Leaving the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   The stall section outside was already empty, with most of the stall cultivators having left.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion did not have a curfew at night, but who knew what kind of dangerous people were lurking in the darkness?   Although the Law Enforcement Team patrolled at night, there would always be blind spots.   Not going out at night had almost become an unspoken rule among cultivators.   Passing through the stall section.   Since the stall section was not far from He Song’s residence.   As a result, He Song hurried back and made it to the front door of his house before it was completely dark.    However, just as He Song was about to open the door and return to his room, a sudden rush of footsteps sounded from behind him.   “Tap tap tap!”   The rapid footsteps closed in quickly.   Hearing the sound, He Song’s expression changed drastically.   For several days in a row, He Song had been returning home at this time without encountering any danger.   Initially, he was cautious every day, but today he inevitably became careless.   He felt regretful in his heart— he should have been more vigilant at all times!   The sudden appearance of footsteps, and considering their direction, seemed to be heading straight for He Song.   Although He Song was in a rush, he managed to take out two crumpled Thick Earth Amulets from his sleeve, but before he could activate them, the sound had already reached his side.actionÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m   In an instant, a gust of wind blew by, and He Song detected a pungent smell of blood coming from the tip of his nose.   A feeling of being preyed upon by a ferocious beast caused He Song’s eyelids to twitch.   The faint spiritual pressure coming from this person beside him made He Song shudder.   This person was not someone he could resist!   However.   Just as He Song subconsciously wanted to activate the Thick Earth Amulet in an attempt to buy some time to wait for the Law Enforcement Team to rescue him, a voice suddenly sounded from beside him.   “Mr. He, don’t worry, it’s me, Lin Cong.” Lin Cong’s voice was somewhat weak, not as deep and strong as it had been during their previous encounter.   But at this moment, He Song showed no signs of relief.   With the spirit power gathered within his body, a surge of spirit power quickly flowed into the Thick Earth Amulet in his hand.   Almost in the blink of an eye, an earthy-yellow barrier enveloped He Song entirely.   This was the defensive barrier that would appear after activating the Thick Earth Amulet.   Although the barrier seemed fragile, its defensive power was strong, and even a Qi-refining mid stage cultivator would need some time to break it.   For a Qi Refining Early Stage cultivator to break this barrier, it might not be so simple.   Having done all this, and being assured of his own safety, He Song finally relaxed and turned his gaze to the person in front of him.   It was indeed Lin Cong.   He was the powerful loose cultivator who lived next door to He Song and had previously greeted him, making a living by hunting demonic beasts.   Right now, although Lin Cong’s stature remained as burly and robust as ever, his expression seemed a bit dispirited.   Upon closer inspection, He Song noticed that Lin Cong appeared to be seriously injured.   There were bloodstains, like splashes of raindrops, across Lin Cong’s chest, which was the source of the pungent smell of blood that He Song had detected earlier.   Apart from that, He Song also found that there seemed to be a sunken part on Lin Cong’s chest. There were no signs of bleeding from the wound, but it seemed to have hurt his internal organs.   Seeing Lin Cong’s weakened state, He Song’s heart finally settled.   Thankfully, the danger was not directed at him.

11 Chapter 11 This is too cautious Translator: 549690339 As long as the person isn’t attacking me, it’s fine.   “So it’s Mrs. Lin, I thought an evil cultivator was attacking…”   After confirming that it was Lin Cong and not sensing any murderous intent, He Song greeted her with cupped hands.   Having said that, He Song glanced at the earthy yellow barrier surrounding him. Although he seemed relieved, he didn’t regret having used the Thick Earth Amulet worth five spirit stones.   No matter how many spirit stones one has, they are worthless if you’re not alive to use them.   Moreover, carrying spirit amulets is for preserving one’s own life, right?   Although there was a scare this time, He Song didn’t think he could always escape danger like this.   It was just an amulet. After all, my life is extremely precious.   He should remain vigilant at all times in the future.   If he dies, that would be a huge loss.   “I have alarmed you, my friend. I, Lin Cong, have returned from injury and wanted to quickly return to my room to heal. I didn’t expect to disturb you.” Lin Cong glanced at the bloodstains on her body and the earthy barrier around He Song, she said with an awkward expression.   Who would have thought that just by walking faster, she would scare her neighbor into using a Thick Earth Amulet?   Are all cultivators so cautious these days?   However, Lin Cong’s awkward expression quickly disappeared, and she took out five spirit stones from her sleeve and placed them in He Song’s hand.   “Here are five spirit stones. Consider it payment for your Thick Earth Amulet. I hope you don’t mind,” said Lin Cong.   After speaking, her face suddenly turned red.   After coughing heavily twice, she greeted He Song with cupped palms and turned to enter her room.   “I’ll be going in to heal my injuries, feel free to do as you please.”   He Song wanted to refuse the five spirit stones from Lin Cong, but he saw that her injuries seemed to worsen, and she needed to heal immediately.   It is not a good time to stop her and might upset Lin Cong.   So he stopped talking, entered his room, and locked the door.   In the dim room,   He Song lit a lamp, illuminating the surroundings, and sat quietly at the table.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m   It wasn’t until this moment that He’s mind calmed down a bit.   Even when talking to Lin Cong earlier, He Song had never let down his guard.   He Song’s thoughts wandered as he recalled the events that had just transpired.   From the start, he had heard Lin Cong’s footsteps.            Then smelling the blood before listening to Lin’s reminder, to using his Thick Earth Amulet and talking face to face with Lin Cong.   After reviewing all the details,   He Song breathed a sigh of relief.   It seemed that this incident was truly just a coincidence.   The severely injured Lin Cong had no motive to attack him.   Moreover, his clothes were enough to deter most loose cultivators.   Indeed, he was too cautious.   A small loss, though,   looking at the five spirit stones on the table, a hint of helplessness flashed across He Song’s eyes.   Although he lost a Thick Earth Amulet, he gained five spirit stones.   It was neither a gain nor a loss,   “This Lin Cong is quite fair. Although, it’s probably because of the clothes I’m wearing that they compensated me with these spirit stones, right?”   Five spirit stones are not a small sum for a first-tier Qi Refining practitioner.   The other party gave them readily,   He Song thought it had a lot to do with the clothes he was wearing.   If it were someone else, Lin Cong might not have given the spirit stones so generously.   Shaking his head, He Song discarded the thoughts from his mind.   He Song’s gaze soon became profound.   Some days ago,   when he first met Lin Cong, she had a daunting appearance, with fierce eyes and muscular physique, like a humanoid demonic beast, utterly fierce at first glance.   Back then, she said she had important matters and left.   It had been only a few days, and she returned with serious injuries.   Although He Song didn’t know what had happened to her, he suspected that it wasn’t a good thing for Lin Cong.   Lin Cong was only a third-tier Qi Refining practitioner with seemingly incredible combat capabilities.   However, outside the Immortal Pavilion, all sorts of dangers could lead to death.   It’s not just that Lin Cong returned injured,   Even if Lin Cong had fallen never to return, He Song wouldn’t be surprised.   However, Lin Cong’s return with injuries only made He Song more confident in his decision to stay at the Immortal Pavilion and cultivate slowly.   Loose cultivators,            especially those who live by the edge of a knife, have a high mortality rate.   Even if they make a lot of money for a while, most of them will die unnatural deaths.   Ultimately, breaking Qi Refining Stage becomes even rarer, let alone reaching Foundation Establishment.   You need the best of luck for such an achievement.   As long as he stays in Immortal Pavilion and cultivates slowly, he will eventually break through the Qi Refining Mid Stage, Qi Refining Late Stage, and even Foundation Establishment Stage…   As an everlasting being,   he just needs a safe environment to keep growing stronger.   Even if it takes a long time,   But… is it time that he, who has achieved immortality, lacks?   Thoughts churned in his mind.   Seeing the injured Lin Cong today made He Song more determined on his future path.   After pondering for a moment,   He Song extinguished the lamp and began to meditate.   However, despite being in a meditative state, He Song remained alert to Lin Cong’s movements in the adjacent room.   In the first half of the night, He Song heard coughing and pained groans from next door.   In the second half of the night, the sounds from next door subsided, and no more noises were heard.   From then on, until daybreak, He Song no longer heard any noise coming from next door.   When the golden sunlight fell from the sky,   he opened his eyes as the warmth enveloped his body, his gaze thoughtful as he looked at the room where Lin Cong was.   He Song got up and left his room.   First, he went to his spirit field to perform the Spirit Rain Skill.   After making a round around the spirit field and not finding any abnormalities, He Song returned to the Stall Section inside the Immortal Pavilion.   Yesterday, he had used a Thick Earth Amulet, leaving only one on him.   But Lin Cong gave him five spirit stones in return.   Naturally, He Song needed to exchange those five spirit stones for a new Thick Earth Amulet.   With only one Thick Earth Amulet on him, He Song always felt somewhat unsafe.   At the Stall Section,   He Song haggled with the amulet seller for a long time.   In the end, his bargain attempt failed, and he had to pay the original price of five spirit stones for a new Thick Earth Amulet.   What could he do?   The amulet business is tough, and the price of five spirit stones has been stable for a long time.   He Song carefully placed the new Thick Earth Amulet, along with the one he already had, into the most accessible part of his sleeve.   In the future, he must not face a situation like last night, when the enemy came near him, and he couldn’t activate the amulet in time.        

12 Chapter 12: Is Lin Cong Dead? Translator: 549690339 After setting up the spirit amulets.   He Song turned and left the Stall Section, returning to his home.   However.   Just as He Song returned home while cautiously practicing his skills, he suddenly heard faint footsteps coming from his surroundings.   The footsteps came from outside the house, immediately making He Song alert.   For a moment, He Song held his breath and concentrated, his cultivation’s heightened senses at their peak, trying to listen to where these footsteps were coming from.   At the same time, two Thick Earth Amulets quietly appeared in He Song’s hands.   If anything went wrong, He Song could guarantee that he would be able to activate the spirit amulets to protect himself.   After all this, He Song’s mind finally settled down.   Following that, he heard the faint footsteps circling around the periphery of the house next door a few times, stopping for a long time at several places before gradually moving away.   When there was no more movement outside.   He Song’s expression finally relaxed.   The two Thick Earth Amulets that had been held in his hands were put back into his sleeves.   “These sounds… Why do they seem like someone is scouting the area?”   With his guard down, He Song immediately recalled the path of the footsteps in his mind and looked at Lin Cong’s house next door.   He Song’s neighbor was Lin Cong.   Last night, Lin Cong came back heavily injured, and today someone had come to scout the area around his house.   This made He Song think a lot.   Last night, he had heard painful moans and violent coughs coming from Lin Cong’s room next door.   It wasn’t until late at night that the sounds coming from Lin Cong’s room gradually lessened, and now there was no sound at all.   He could hear it.   So could Lin Cong’s other neighbor.   Among the rows of houses, each house has two neighbors, and the sounds from each house can be heard clearly by the others.   In this case.   He Song’s gaze towards his neighbor’s house had become a bit deeper.   It seemed that the person who had come to scout was Lin Cong’s other neighbor.   Could it be that Lin Cong… had already died from his injuries in his room?    Otherwise, how could one explain the long silence in the other party’s room?   A look of eagerness flashed in He Song’s eyes, but he soon dismissed the idea.   Whether Lin Cong was dead or not.   His belongings shouldn’t be taken by himself.   If Lin Cong was still alive and He Song broke in rashly, with Lin Cong’s strong physique and third-tier Qi Refining cultivation, killing him would probably not be much more difficult than killing a chicken.   Breaking into someone’s home and getting killed by the homeowner is self-inflicted, and the Law Enforcement Team wouldn’t have anything to say about it.   Even if Lin Cong was dead and He Song obtained his belongings.   Lin Cong’s other neighbor had already set their sights on them as well.   If he made a move first and took the items, he would likely be targeted by a cultivator whose strength he was uncertain about.   A third-tier Qi Refining cultivator’s belongings were hardly worth it for him to take the risk of offending another cultivator whose strength he couldn’t gauge.   With various thoughts flashing through his mind, He Song reconsidered, and eventually closed his eyes again, continuing to practice the three basic skills he had just learned.   Breath Concealment Formulas.   Spirit Vision Skill.   Sound Transmission Skill.   The practice of these three basic skills was not difficult.   Although the time required for them was longer than the Spirit Rain Skill and Spiritual Arrow Skill, it wasn’t much longer.   It took He Song ten days to practice the Spirit Rain Skill to the point where he could use it normally without damaging its power.   The Spiritual Arrow Skill was the same.   Meanwhile, with the Breath Concealment Formulas, Spirit Vision Skill, and Sound Transmission Skill, He Song felt that it would take half a month to use each skill normally without damaging its power.   Half a month was just an increase of five days compared to the ten days required for the Spirit Rain Skill and Spiritual Arrow Skill.   It seemed that the difficulty of practicing these three basic skills was not too high.   He Song’s first basic skill to practice was the Breath Concealment Formulas.   Not for any other reason.   It was just because the Breath Concealment Formulas could hide his breath, making it difficult for others to detect.   With a thoughtful glance at the house next door, He Song quickly immersed himself in the process of practicing the Breath Concealment Formulas.   …   Time flies.   In a blink of an eye, half a month had passed.   In this half a month, besides practicing the Breath Concealment Formulas, He Song had also taken the time to visit the two seniors he had just met at the Immortal Pavilion.    Spiritual Medicine Pavilion’s Meng Guan and Spirit Construction Pavilion’s Wei Fan.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com   These two were from the same sect and had known each other for a long time.   Both being insiders of the Immortal Pavilion, though He Song’s cultivation was somewhat low, as a spiritual plant farmer, he still had some worth in making connections.   Moreover, his character had been approved by Wei Fan.   With both parties willing to make friends, He Song and their acquaintances had a smooth relationship.   After a few visits, He Song’s relationship with the two gradually grew closer.   At least, without any interest involved, it was easy for He Song to obtain some information from them.   On this day.   He Song was sitting on a cushion in his house, his breath flickering in and out of existence.   But then, He Song’s breath disappeared without a trace as if he had turned into an unyielding rock, showing no sign of life at all.   “Breath Concealment Formulas, success!” Opening his eyes, a flash of joy crossed He Song’s face.action   With the success of the Breath Concealment Formulas, He Song only needed to think and he could gather all his breath.   As long as he wasn’t seen with the naked eye, He Song would be like a stubborn rock, and no one could feel a trace of his breath.   Hiding his breath.   He Song stood up from the cushion, brewed himself a pot of tea, and took a few satisfying sips.   During these days of visiting Wei Fan and Meng Guan, He Song’s tea-making skills had improved as well.   He was even gifted a set of tea utensils and some tea leaves by Wei Fan so that he could enjoy brewing tea on his own at home.   However, just as He Song was savoring each sip of tea, he once again heard faint footsteps in his ears.   In an instant, He Song’s figure stood still, like a stubborn rock in his room, with only the faint fragrance of tea wafting around his nose, his ears silently listening to the direction of the footsteps.   Half a month had passed, and Lin Cong’s other neighbor had indeed held back.   Until today, He Song hadn’t heard the other party step into Lin Cong’s room.   Every time the footsteps came, they would circle around Lin Cong’s house, stand still in several places for a while, and then quietly leave.   It happened like this every time.   It was extreme caution.   Even He Song, under the other party’s cautious attitude, had higher demands for his own attitude to be careful.   What is caution? This is true caution!   They were willing to scout for half a month just for a small gain.   However, this time seemed to be different.   It seemed that because the person couldn’t sense He Song’s breath, they thought He Song wasn’t home, and this time the scout had become bolder.   The footsteps wandering around the house were not as faint as before.   Listening to the different footsteps in his ears, He Song pondered.   “Could it be that this person didn’t take action before because they sensed that I was still at home? Now that I’ve learned the Breath Concealment Formulas and hidden my breath, they can’t sense my breath, so they’re getting ready to strike?”

13 Chapter 13: Waiting for a Long Time Translator: 549690339 A thought flashed through his mind.   He Song lowered his head to look at the teacup in front of him, speechless in his heart.   It seemed.   The other party was not really cautious.   Instead, they sensed his presence, so they didn’t dare to take action all this time.   It might be because they were worried that he would ambush them when they made a move, or because they were worried that Lin Cong wasn’t dead.   But now it seemed.   It was very likely that the other party would make a move today.   He Song carefully listened to the footsteps in the room next door while holding the teacup without any movement.   He heard faint footsteps circling the house, then stopping at the window of the adjacent room.   A moment of pause.   Creak~   With a faint sound, He Song suddenly realized that the window of Lin Cong’s house had been opened by someone.   With the window opened.   The person who had been scouting for half a month quickly entered the room.   Closing the window.   Afterward, the surroundings became quiet.   He Song was not anxious, still holding the teacup and listening quietly.   He was waiting.   Waiting for the other party to succeed and leave.   Or for Lin Cong to take action and kill the other party.   No matter how the situation developed, it wouldn’t have a big impact on He Song, so he naturally wouldn’t care too much.   Next door.   A thin man dressed in a long robe gently closed the window behind him, shutting out most of the noise from outside.   His eyes scanning the room, the man quickly moved towards the only quiet chamber in the room.   The rented houses in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion had an outer room with windows and a quiet chamber.   The outer room was made of ordinary wood for entertaining guests and daily living.   The quiet chamber was built of soundproof wood for daily cultivation and skill practice, without worrying about being disturbed.   Almost every house was designed like this.   So the man was quite familiar with the layout.   The sound of his footsteps was barely audible as he approached the quiet chamber with a fine steel dagger in hand, treading carefully.   “Half a month’s time, if this person is dead, the body in the quiet chamber should not have started to smell rotten yet. However, that guy from next door stays in his room all day doing who knows what, making me wait for half a month in vain. If there’s a chance next time…”   As he approached the quiet chamber, a trace of viciousness flashed in the man’s eyes.    But then, he shook his head.   “Forget it, that guy is an inside man from the Immortal Pavilion. If I kill him, I won’t be able to stay in the Immortal Pavilion either. But thankfully, he’s not home today. I’ll gladly take this person’s possessions!”   With such calculations in his heart, a thick greed appeared in the man’s eyes as he looked at the quiet chamber.   The possessions of a third-tier Qi Refining practitioner.   That should be worth at least a few dozen spirit stones, right?   He knew very well that Lin Cong looked strong and was no ordinary cultivator.   It was difficult to open the door of a quiet chamber from the outside when it was closed.   But it was not difficult for a cultivating immortal.   In a situation where they didn’t need to worry about being disturbed, it was quite easy for a cultivator to break into a quiet chamber.   However, the sound might attract the attention of people nearby.   That was why he had waited for He Song to leave before starting to act.   Screech~ Screech~   With a teeth-gnashing sound, the door of the quiet chamber was slowly pried open.   However.   Just as the door of the quiet chamber was pried open and everything inside was exposed to the man’s eyes, a sense of horror instantly surged in his heart.   “I’ve been waiting for you for quite some time.” Lin Cong sneered as he spoke, his large hand like a fan fiercely grabbing the man’s neck.   With his other hand, he gently made a seal.   A ray of sword light instantly severed both the man’s hands and feet.   Right after, a long sword artifact, controlled by Lin Cong, pointed at the man’s incredibly horrified eyes.   The intense pain in his body.   As well as the suffocation at his neck.   As well as the sudden fear of being turned into a human stick.   The man who originally wanted to come and pick up the remains had his eyes wide open in anger.   He wanted to scream.   But the pressure on his neck prevented him from making a sound.   He wanted to beg for mercy, but found that he couldn’t even speak.   All he could do was keep indicating with his eyes for Lin Cong to spare his life.   At this moment.   The bloodstains on Lin Cong’s body had dried, and the depression in his chest, though not healed, was much better than before.   Not only did he not die.   It seemed that Lin Cong’s injuries had also healed significantly.   With the third-tier Qi Refining cultivation, combined with his tiger-wolf-like physique, he easily subdued the man in front of him.   “If you had come in the second day, I might have really fallen for your tricks. But you didn’t dare to enter the house until half a month later.” Looking at the man who had already been turned into a human stick before him, a glint of ruthlessness flashed in Lin Cong’s eyes.   The big hand pinching the man’s neck also began to exert force at this moment.action   “Remember in your next life, there are some things either you don’t touch, or if you touch, you must use thunderous methods!”    Before his death.   The man heard these words in his ear.   He couldn’t help cursing He Song in his heart.   If it wasn’t for the fear of being caught by He Song waiting to seize him, he wouldn’t have waited until today to make a move.   He might have gone directly to Lin Cong’s house the day after learning that Lin Cong was seriously injured and returned.   He also didn’t expect that He Song was practicing skills, and hadn’t really left the house for half a month.   Unfortunately, there is no if in this world.   He Song wouldn’t know the curses in the man’s heart at this moment.   Neither did Lin Cong in front of him.   He couldn’t even know what the man was thinking at the moment.   He Song, who had unknowingly killed a person, didn’t know what had happened to the man who entered Lin Cong’s house.   Nor did he know what the man had encountered after entering Lin Cong’s house.   But.   After waiting for half a day and still not seeing the man come out as it began to get dark, He Song already had the answer in his heart.   This man was probably already dead in Lin Cong’s house.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎   And Lin Cong most likely didn’t die either, and was just healing his injuries in the room.   As for why there had been no sound for half a month.   He probably ate an Inedia Elixir, and combined with sitting and healing, which didn’t require any movement, naturally there would be no sound.   Some speculations flashed through his mind, and He Song’s expression quickly relaxed.   Whether Lin Cong was dead or alive.   It didn’t really matter to him.   If he was dead, he wouldn’t lose anything.   If he wasn’t dead, he wouldn’t gain anything either.   The two of them had only met twice and greeted each other twice.   With a gentleman’s friendship as light as water, He Song wouldn’t take this matter to heart.   After tidying up the tea set.   He Song quickly began to meditate and practice.   …   Time flies.   Time flies like an arrow.   In the blink of an eye, another month quietly passed.   At this time, it had been a month and a half since He Song became a spiritual plant farmer.   The spirit rice that grew in the five-acre spirit field had already been pulled out by He Song and replanted.   This was a little trick recorded in the “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill” that could effectively increase the yield of spirit rice, which was similar to the rice planting He Song experienced in his previous life.   On this day.   Like usual, He Song woke up, ate breakfast, and then used the Spirit Rain Skill at the spirit field for half an hour.   However, just when He Song finished casting the Spirit Rain Skill and his body was empty of spirit power, preparing to return home to recover, an unexpected figure stopped him.   “Mr. He, I said before that I would come and visit you, but I didn’t get the chance to since I was severely injured. Now that my injuries are healed, I’ve come to bother you.” Lin Cong, who had already fully recovered from his injuries, stood at the entrance of He Song’s house, clasped his hands and said to He Song.

14 Chapter 14: 5 Years Translator: 549690339 At this moment, Lin Cong’s injuries were no longer visible.   He had changed into a new set of clothes, and the bloodstained garments he had been wearing were probably discarded.   The depression in his chest had been fully repaired, and was no longer as horrifying as before.   Now, Lin Cong had not only returned to his previous muscular and fierce appearance, but he also had no significant difference from ordinary cultivators.   After a month and a half of recuperation.   He had fully recovered.   Looking at Lin Cong in front of him, a glint flashed in He Song’s eyes.   “Spirit Vision Skill!”   At a glance, He Song noticed that Lin Cong’s cultivation was still at third-tier Qi Refining, and he had not broken through to the Qi-refining mid stage.   After a month, He Song had already practiced two basic skills to the point that he could use them normally without reducing their power.   He had mastered both the Spirit Vision Skill and the Sound Transmission Skill.   Therefore, when he encountered Lin Cong, He Song subconsciously used the Spirit Vision Skill to see Lin Cong’s current cultivation.   “Congratulations on your full recovery, Daoist friend. Please come in.” He Song said with a smile, the glint in his eyes flashing.   Having a neighbor visit him, He Song naturally wouldn’t repel them with a thousand mile distance.   He opened the door.   And invited Lin Cong to sit down in the house.   He Song didn’t have much to entertain his guests.   So he took out the tea set given to him by Wei Fan and made a pot of tea for Lin Cong.   He Song was not familiar with the quality of the tea.   However, he figured that tea leaves given to him by a Qi-refining late stage expert like Wei Fan would certainly not be ordinary tea.   Using it to entertain a third-tier Qi Refining cultivator like Lin Cong should be more than enough.   “Good tea, my friend. You certainly know how to enjoy life,” Lin Cong said, after taking a sip, his voice full of appreciation.   Upon hearing this, He Song raised an eyebrow.   It seemed he had said something similar in front of Wei Fan before.   He just didn’t know whether Lin Cong really thought the tea was good, or if he simply couldn’t tell and was just making a fuss.   He poured another cup of tea for Lin Cong.   He Song shook his head and dismissed the thoughts in his mind.   It was just a pot of tea after all.   “As for the quality of the tea, I’m not sure. However, both the tea set and tea leaves were gifts from a senior. My humble abode is rather simple, and this is the only decent thing I could offer. I hope you don’t mind, Daoist friend.”   It was certainly good tea.            And undoubtedly a fine tea set.   It was a significant opportunity for a Qi Refining Early Stage cultivator like He Song to receive such gifts from a Qi-refining late stage expert.   Although He Song didn’t know the price of the tea leaves and tea set, he was sure they were not cheap.   By saying this, he was merely trying to arouse Lin Cong’s curiosity and prompt him to ask who the senior was.   Once Lin Cong asked, He Song could conveniently tell him the truth about his Qi-refining late stage expert friend, making Lin Cong aware that he had a powerful backer.   Memories of the fate of the man who broke into Lin Cong’s house a month ago flashed through He Song’s mind, and a hint of vigilance appeared in his eyes.   These loose cultivators, who lived on the edge, were too dangerous for him.   If he couldn’t make them wary, he was afraid he would have to live in fear from now on.   “Oh? It was a gift from a senior? May I ask, what was that senior’s cultivation?” As expected, Lin Cong immediately showed astonishment upon hearing He Song’s words.   “Seventh-tier Qi Refining.”   “…”   A moment later, He Song personally escorted Lin Cong out of the house.   At this point, Lin Cong’s attitude toward He Song had clearly changed considerably.   Initially, He Song felt that Lin Cong was polite to him, but only because of the clothes he wore, and didn’t want to offend him.   But now, upon learning that he had a Qi-refining late stage backer, Lin Cong’s attitude toward He Song had shifted to wanting to befriend him.   Being part of the Immortal Pavilion’s internal staff was not intimidating.   What was terrifying was that he also had a backer.   Who could guarantee that He Song wouldn’t be able to ask the Qi-refining late stage expert for help?   It’s truly beneficial to be friends with someone like him who could be helpful in the future if something happened.   With this in mind, the change in Lin Cong’s attitude towards He Song was naturally justified.   He Song watched Lin Cong leave.   He Song closed the door behind him.   Sitting back down at the table, he picked up the still warm tea and silently poured himself a cup.   “Backers and status? They are but fleeting illusions. What I can truly rely on is myself.”   As he sat down at the table, there was no sign of smugness on He Song’s face.   Even though revealing his background had made Lin Cong look at him with newfound respect, He Song didn’t feel any sense of superiority.   He knew.   A background and status – all of these were empty and meaningless.   Only one’s own cultivation could truly allow oneself to hold one’s head high.   A backer might sever ties with you at the first sign of distaste.   Status could also be stripped by the Immortal Pavilion.   But as long as one’s cultivation improved, it would be a permanent improvement that nobody could strip away.    Although he thought so, He Song was somewhat satisfied with his earlier actions.   If he didn’t intimidate someone like Lin Cong, who had lived on the edge of a sword, He Song wouldn’t even feel at ease cultivating at home.   Only by letting the other person know that he wasn’t to be trifled with would they not harbor any unnecessary thoughts towards him.   In this regard, He Song had achieved his goal.   The change in Lin Cong’s attitude toward He Song before and after his arrival indicated that he probably wouldn’t have any ulterior motives towards him.action   With his worries gone, He Song took a big sip of tea.   He then began his cultivation for the day.   …   Days went by, one after another.   He Song’s life followed a regular pattern.   After his morning cultivation, he would go to the spirit field to use Spirit Rain Skill for half an hour.   He would then return home and meditate to restore the spirit power in his body.   If there were matters to attend to, after recovering his spirit power, he would go out.   If there weren’t any, He Song would occasionally visit the Spirit Construction Pavilion to chat with Wei Fan over tea or go to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion to chat with Meng Guan over tea.   Apart from this, He Song spent every day immersed in cultivation.   Time flew by.   In the blink of an eye, five years had passed.   During these five years, He Song led a very peaceful life.   There were no Evil Cultivators to kill him.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com   No natural disasters or man-made calamities.   No wars between sects.   Everything was calm.   However, He Song occasionally learned some secret news from Wei Fan.   For example, a certain Loose Cultivator bought something in the Immortal Pavilion and was besieged by Evil Cultivators as soon as he left.   An example was someone who could not resign himself to mediocrity, resigning from the Immortal Pavilion and heading towards Green Wall Immortal City, but disappearing halfway there.   For instance, someone found a precious vein, causing countless families to fight over it, with the Thick Earth Sect finally claiming it in the end.   Various secrets made He Song’s understanding of the current Cultivation World even deeper.   As for He Song’s cultivation level, he had broken through from the original first-tier Qi Refining to the present third-tier Qi Refining.   Sitting on the cushion, He Song exhaled a long breath, his eyes flashing with spiritual light.   Having just broken through to the third-tier Qi Refining, He Song had yet to control the surging spirit power within his body for a moment.   As a result, a trace of spirit power escaped from his eyes, causing the flash of spiritual light before him.   “Third-tier Qi Refining, the next step is to store up spirit power to break through the bottleneck of the Qi-refining mid-stage.”   Feeling the much stronger spirit power in his body compared to before, a smile flashed in He Song’s eyes.   The increase in spirit power allowed He Song to manage more spirit fields.   Managing more spirit fields meant that He Song could earn more and more spirit stones.

15 Chapter 15: VIP Room Translator: 549690339 In the Cultivation World.   In the Thick Earth Sect.   In the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   No matter in which corner of the Cultivation World, one’s cultivation realm always dictates their worth.   The stronger one’s cultivation, the more resources they can control.   Naturally, the number of spirit stones they can obtain will also increase.   For example, when He Song was at the first-tier Qi Refining stage, his identity as a spiritual plant farmer allowed him to manage only a five-acre spirit field.   The five-acre spirit field brought He Song a meager annual income of 150 spirit stones.   Out of those, 120 spirit stones had to be used to pay rent.   Only the remaining 30 spirit stones were fully at He Song’s disposal.   However…   When He Song’s cultivation reached the Qi-refining mid-stage,   and he truly became a spiritual plant farmer in the Qi-refining mid-stage, the spirit fields he could manage would increase.   By then, the spirit stones He Song could obtain each year would be much more than what he currently receives.   But now is not the time to think about these matters.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎   Having just broken through to the third-tier Qi Refining stage, He Song felt a considerable distance to break through to the Qi-refining mid-stage.   Getting up from his meditation mat,   He Song happily brewed himself a pot of good tea.   Over a period of five years,   Under the influence of Wei Fan and Meng Guan, He Song’s tea art had improved, and he also began to study tea leaves in depth.   He had a good grasp of which teas were excellent, which teas could only be enjoyed once, and which teas had special effects after five years of exploration.   Nowadays, he occasionally indulged in the habit of tea-drinking.   “At the third-tier Qi Refining stage, although I am still at the bottom of the Cultivation World, I have gained more means compared to the first-tier Qi Refining stage.”   In these five years, He Song had earned a total of 150 spirit stones as a spiritual plant farmer.   Thirty per year, adding up to 150 spirit stones in five years.   Aside from covering his food expenses and occasional visits to Wei Fan and Meng Guan, He Song hadn’t wasted his spirit stones; instead, he had been saving them.   By now, He Song had accumulated over a hundred spirit stones.   Although being a spiritual plant farmer had brought many benefits to He Song earlier,    as an everlasting being, how could he be satisfied with tending fields forever?   Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   Elixir refinement, artifact refinement, amulet making, Array Skills, beast taming…   Which of these was not more attractive than farming?   It was only because his cultivation was too low, and he couldn’t access these things, that He Song had to follow his predecessor’s path of becoming a spiritual plant farmer.   However, He Song would definitely be unwilling to remain a spiritual plant farmer forever.   Which everlasting being would want to farm every day?   Thus, accumulating money to purchase entry-level books on Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth had become He Song’s deep-rooted desire.   “Since my soul is stronger than other cultivators’ and I can learn skills faster, wouldn’t I be more talented in learning the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth than others?”   As he sipped his tea, a thought flashed through He Song’s mind.   An idea to immediately go to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to select books on Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth rapidly sprouted and took root in his mind at that very moment.   In five years, He Song had saved up a hundred or so spirit stones.   According to his previous understanding, the entry-level books of Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth mostly cost about a hundred spirit stones each, similar in price to cultivation skills.   Now that he had broken through to the third-tier Qi Refining stage, his life was dull and monotonous—spending his days either tending the spirit fields or meditating and cultivating.   It was indeed quite boring.   It was also time for him to find something to do and learn a new money-making skill!   A determined light flashed across his eyes.   He Song abruptly stood up, put all his spirit stones into his sleeve, and strode out of the room.   Stall Section.   Spirit Skill Pavilion.   Wearing the attire of a spiritual plant farmer, He Song quickly arrived here amidst the awe-filled gazes of other loose cultivators.   After five years, He Song had grown indifferent to the reverential looks from the cultivators around him.   The gap in status between the internal cultivators of Immortal Pavilion and the loose cultivators was as different as heaven and earth within the pavilion.   But if it were in the outside world,   Identity of the internal staff of the Immortal Pavilion could even bring about calamities.   The awe from those loose cultivators was nothing more than respect for the Immortal Pavilion behind He Song.   It had nothing to do with He Song himself.   Entering the Spirit Skill Pavilion,   Before He Song could even raise his head to look around, a familiar voice came to his ears.   “Mr. He, it’s been a while. Ping’er pays her respects. Have you come today to see which skill you fancy?”   Ping’er.    The beautiful female cultivator who had received He Song the first time he came to the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   The memory of cultivators is generally very good—they can recognize people they’ve met once, even if they haven’t seen them for decades, at first glance.   At the same time, if they remember the other person’s aura, they can still recognize them at a glance even if they meet again after hundreds or even thousands of years and the other person’s appearance has changed.   That was why Ping’er still recognized He Song even though he had not set foot in the Spirit Skill Pavilion for five years.   Five years had passed.   He Song’s appearance hadn’t changed.   Ping’er’s appearance hadn’t changed either.   In the Cultivation World, eternal youth is the norm. Most cultivators who are decades or even centuries old still have young faces.   Only oddballs like Meng Guan would prefer to show themselves as old men.   As a result, He Song had never felt anxious about his appearance over the past five years.   “I’ve seen fellow Daoist Ping’er. I came here this time to look at the introductory books on the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.”   With a slight bow to Ping’er, He Song laughed.   He had come for this purpose, and now, facing the guide of the Spirit Skill Pavilion, he naturally had nothing to hide.   However,   Just as He Song’s words fell, Ping’er looked at him with a slight surprise.   But soon after, the surprise in her eyes disappeared.   “Mr. He, please follow me to the VIP room for a chat.” Ping’er said softly, and quickly began to lead the way.   At the same time, Ping’er’s thoughts swirled in her mind.   The Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth’s introductory books, costing hundreds of spirit stones each, were not something everyone could afford.   Especially for someone like He Song, who had just entered the Immortal Pavilion for only five years and was still at the third-tier Qi Refining stage.   Being able to save up so many spirit stones in five years,   Ping’er suddenly felt a little curious about He Song behind her.   Could it be… this person doesn’t use spirit stones for cultivation?   Or did he just happen to come across a fortune and got some spirit stones?   Spirit stones.action   Not only currency, but also cultivation resources.   Using spirit stones for cultivation can speed up a cultivator’s progress.   That’s why spirit stones become the hard currency in the entire Cultivation World.   At the same time, they are the source of Ping’er’s confusion.   She, like He Song, was part of the internal staff of the Immortal Pavilion. Receiving two spirit stones each month for lodging, she was responsible for entertaining cultivators who came to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to purchase skills.   Every time she received her monthly allowance of spirit stones, she used them for her own cultivation in order to quickly improve her cultivation level in a short amount of time.   As a result, she never had any leftover spirit stones.   When it comes to someone like He Song, who can save up to a hundred spirit stones in five years, it’s inevitable that she would be puzzled.   Would there really be someone who doesn’t use spirit stones to cultivate and quickly improve their realm, instead saving them to buy things?

16 Chapter 16: Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth Translator: 549690339 In Ping’er’s mind, as long as she got the spirit stone, she would definitely think of turning the spirit stone into her own cultivation base as the first thing to do.   In the Qi Refining Early Stage, the speed of cultivation improvement is the most important.   However, she didn’t know.   He Song was completely different from her and other cultivators.   Cultivators struggle with the heavens for life. If they want to live longer, they must convert all things that can be transformed into cultivation into their own cultivation.   If they can’t break through to prolong their life before the end of life comes, they will die.   In this way.   Under the threat of death, the monks basically invest the resources they obtain into improving their own cultivation.   Only by continuously improving their cultivation can they gain more powerful strength and longer life.   This is also the reason why cultivators like to shout things like “my fate is in my own hands, not the heavens,” “acting against the heavens,” and “those who don’t fight in cultivation will die.”   Their lifespan is at stake.   If they don’t fight, they will die.   However.   He Song was different from them.   Already possessing immortality and an endless lifespan, death was no longer his constraint.   Knowing that he already had an endless lifespan, He Song still hoped that his cultivation could grow rapidly.   But in reality, he wasn’t that eager.   He naturally knew that using spirit stones could increase his own cultivation speed.   But knowing was one thing.   Actually doing it was another matter.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was very safe.   There was no large-scale conflict between cultivators in this area under the control of the Thick Earth Sect.   Although it happened that a Foundation Establishment Clan had gone mad when nearby mineral veins were discovered, the dispute quickly subsided after the Thick Earth Sect intervened.   From this, one could see that.   The four Immortal Cities controlled by the Thick Earth Sect, as well as the Immortal Pavilions controlled by these four Immortal Cities, were generally considered relatively safe.    In a relatively safe situation, He Song’s idea of accumulating spirit stones and prioritizing the purchase of introductory books of the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth to earn more spirit stones was completely fine.   He Song and Ping’er each looked at the problem from their own perspective.   Neither side was wrong.   But it was difficult for Ping’er to understand He Song’s thoughts at the moment.   Therefore.   After leading He Song into the VIP room and serving him a pot of good tea, Ping’er left with a belly full of doubts to prepare the things He Song needed.   The VIP room was small, but the various furnishings inside were exceptionally exquisite.   He Song could even sense faint fluctuations of spirit Qi from these furnishings.   This meant that the materials used to make these furnishings were all spiritual materials. Although they didn’t seem to be very old, they were still spiritual materials, which were countless times more precious than the mundane wood in the Mortal World.   He Song’s fingers gently stroked the table in front of him, a hint of envy in his eyes.   When could he have furniture made from spiritual materials?   This Spirit Skill Pavilion was really rich.   Picking up the teacup in front of him, he took a gentle sip.   Good tea!   He Song’s eyes lit up.   As soon as he swallowed the tea, it transformed into strands of spirit power that blended into his body, giving his cultivation a slight increase.   If he could drink this kind of tea for years and years, He Song felt that his cultivation rate would be much faster than before.   I wonder what the name of this tea is.   If I have spirit stones in the future, I have to buy some of this tea.   His mind made up.   He Song sipped his tea while waiting for Ping’er to return.   He didn’t have to wait long.   Soon enough.   Ping’er came to He Song’s side, carrying a tray filled with various kinds of books.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com   She put the tray on the table and casually picked up the closest book to her.   “This is the Elixir Refinement Introduction, which contains the formulas for three elixirs – Inedia Elixir, Qi Nourishing Elixir, and Rising Spirit Elixir – as well as general knowledge about elixir refining.”   “This is the Artifacts Refining Introduction, which contains two artifact refining methods for one attack and one defense, and general knowledge about refining artifacts.”   “This is the Amulet Tao Introduction, which contains the techniques for making Thick Earth Amulet, Golden Sword Amulet, and Divine Movement Amulet, as well as general knowledge about amulet making.”action    “This is the Array Tao Introduction, which contains the layout diagrams for Spirit-Gathering Array, Five Phases Array, and Illusion Array, as well as general knowledge about array tao.”   “This is the Beast Taming Introduction, which contains the methods for attracting, enticing, and taming beasts, as well as the production methods and general knowledge for the materials required to attract and entice demonic beasts.”   “This is…”   Listening to Ping’er’s melodious voice explaining to him, He Song’s eyes swept over one book after another.   The Elixir Refinement Introduction had three elixir formulas. Inedia Elixir had no grade, Qi Nourishing Elixir was for Qi Refining Early Stage cultivators to increase their cultivation, and Rising Spirit Elixir was for helping cultivators break through their bottleneck in Qi-refining mid stage.   However, the amount of resources needed for refining elixirs was just too much.   Elixir furnace, various precious medicinal materials – He Song simply couldn’t afford them, so he ignored it.   He Song also ignored the Artifacts Refining Introduction.   Refining artifacts also required artifact refining furnaces and various precious ores, which He Song still couldn’t afford.   As for the Amulet Tao Introduction, He Song felt that it had some potential.   The Thick Earth Amulet was for protection, the Golden Sword Amulet for offense, and the Divine Movement Amulet for escape. Perfect!   However, the existence of amulet pens, amulet ink, and amulet paper made He Song hesitate.   He couldn’t afford them!   The Array Tao Introduction, He Song considered it.   Not for anything else, but because learning array skills didn’t require spending too many spirit stones.   Setting up arrays required engraving array patterns on spirit stones or other carriers and placing them in specific locations using special techniques to form the array.   Once an array was set up, it only needed to have its spirit stones replaced periodically to keep it running.   Additionally, setting up arrays didn’t require purchasing various expensive materials for learning purposes.   As such, He Song showed interest in the Array Tao Introduction.   Upon hearing what materials were needed for attracting, enticing, and taming beasts in the Beast Taming Introduction, He Song already had his answer.   Luring demonic beasts also required special materials.   Moreover, since beast taming was quite common in the Cultivation World, these special materials were quite expensive.   To complete a beast taming, it was feared that the spirit stones spent could buy a demonic beast token from the Spirit Beast Pavilion.   The Spirit Beast Pavilion was a place that specialized in capturing demonic beasts and selling their tokens.   As long as one held a demonic beast token, the life and death of the demonic beast was at the cultivator’s mercy, without having to worry about resistance.   Without interrupting Ping’er.   He Song continued to listen.   Soon, He Song had a general understanding of the introductions to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   After a while.   It wasn’t until the voice in his ear suddenly stopped that He Song looked up at Ping’er, only to see her looking at him with grief. He Song thought for a while, then passed her a cup of tea.   “Ahem, thank you, Daoist Ping’er, for explaining. Have some tea to moisten your throat.”

17 Chapter 17: Array Tao Introduction Translator: 549690339 Being stared at by a beautiful female cultivator, He Song had a straight face but felt a bit embarrassed in his heart.   He didn’t know what others experienced when buying the Introduction to Hundred Skills of Cultivation.   But by looking at the desolate expression on Ping’er’s face, he realized.   He might be the most eccentric guest she has ever received.   Starting with Elixir Refinement Introduction, Ping’er never stopped talking. It wasn’t until after she finished introducing all the items in the tray, that she finally stopped.   During this time, Ping’er said so much that even He Song himself couldn’t count. He was so bored that he almost fell asleep.   Luckily, he didn’t doze off.   He Song sighed with relief at the thought and looked at Ping’er with a hint of admiration in his eyes.   Such dedication she had, never stopping until the customer asked her to.   Today, such an honest and dedicated female cultivator like Ping’er was truly hard to come by.   “Thank you, Mr. He. Have you decided which one you want?” Ping’er, who had softened her gaze after receiving the teacup handed over by He Song, asked.   He Song was the only visitor who had made her introduce every single Introduction to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation.   Other cultivators who visited the Spirit Skill Pavilion would specify what they wanted right upon entering.   But not He Song, he acted as if he was visiting the Spirit Skill Pavilion simply to listen to tales.   According to the Pavilion’s rules, Ping’er couldn’t stop unless He Song asked her to.   She almost lost her voice from speaking so much, something that wouldn’t even happen in an entire day usually.   Thankfully, He Song seemed to realize something and gave her a cup of spirit tea.   This gesture gave her some relief at heart.   In fact, it even made her excuse He Song to some extent.   In her opinion, He Song seemingly didn’t do all this on purpose.   With this thought fading away in her mind, Ping’er’s gaze towards He Song softened completely.   “Let’s go with the Array Tao Introduction, and thank you again.” After such long contemplation, He Song finally made up his mind.   The Array Tao.   Truly difficult indeed.   Cultivators with no talent could painstakingly study for decades and still not be able to set up even the simplest Spirit-Gathering Array.   Even some gifted cultivators would need to study for many years before they could understand the basics.   Studying Array Tao posed a huge risk for loose cultivators without a steady income.    During the process, most cultivators’ cultivation would stagnate.   Because they were using all of their time on Array Tao, they couldn’t spare any for cultivation.   That, combined with the possibility of having no talent for Array Tao, could result in the worst disaster if after decades of seemingly fruitless study, they still couldn’t learn Array Tao and their cultivation level remained far behind their peers.   Even if they were gifted in the Art of Arrays, it still required a long study period. For cultivators in the Qi Refining stage, their cultivation level was the most crucial aspect.   If they wasted so much time on Array Tao and wanted to reach the Foundation Establishment stage later, it could be rather difficult.   Therefore, studying Array Tao was rare among loose cultivators.   Even among disciples of sects or noble families, those who are not particularly interested wouldn’t put much effort into studying it.   The reason being, it’s too hard!   Notwithstanding, once you have a basic understanding of Array Tao, it could bring massive benefits to the cultivators.   Take the simplest Spirit Gathering Array for an example.   Once you learn Spirit Gathering Array, you could set it up at your place to gather the spirit Qi for yourself.   When the concentration of spirit Qi increases, naturally your cultivation speed would be much faster than other cultivators.   Besides, the Spirit-Gathering Array has other uses.   For instance, it could be used to nourish the spirit field.   Or help other cultivators to set up Spirit-Gathering Arrays while receiving a high reward in return.   Becoming an Array Path Master is difficult.action   But once you successfully become one, whether it’s setting up arrays for others or nourishing your spirit field using the Spirit-Gathering Array, the benefits are immense.   The rare the thing, the more valuable it is. This fact is undeniable.   As for He Song.   He possesses a more potent soul than other cultivators.   Not to mention his endless lifespan.   Furthermore, he’s also a spiritual plant farmer who could make use of the spirit field.   With all these advantages, choosing the Array Tao Introduction seemed like a natural course of action to him.   “Please wait a moment, Mr. He, while I go fetch the jade slip for you.” Holding the tray, Ping’er took her leave.   Naturally, the introductions to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation couldn’t possibly be books.   The numerous books there on the tray were just introductions to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation.   The actual Hundred Skills of Cultivation wouldn’t be displayed until one’s intention is confirmed.   A hundred spirit stones for a piece.   There must be dozens of pieces in the tray.    If they were real, what if somebody stole them? There would be a loss of thousands of spirit stones.   If such losses occurred too many times, even the Spirit Skill Pavilion of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion couldn’t bear it.   Therefore, Ping’er’s words made sense.   Suddenly.   Ping’er returned.   This time, however, the numerous books that were formerly in the tray had disappeared.   What replaced them was a jade slip emitting a faint glow.   This jade slip looked exquisite, clearly a valuable item.   He Song handed over a hundred spirit stones.   Once Ping’er received the spirit stones, she placed the tray in front of He Song’s face.   “You just need to affix the jade slip onto your forehead, Mr. He.” Ping’er’s voice came swiftly.   He Song nodded, then picked up the jade slip from the tray and pasted it onto his forehead.   Before reaching the Foundation Establishment Stage, cultivators do not possess divine sense. To read the information in the jade slip, they can only affix it onto their foreheads.   However, once they reached the Foundation Establishment Stage and divine sense is formed, the jade slip would not need to be affixed to the forehead anymore. They could just probe straight into it with divine sense.   And the carrier of information, the jade slip, could only be manufactured after one reached the Foundation Establishment Stage and acquired divine sense.   What He Song was experiencing now was the service provided by a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Stage.   Jade slip affixed to his forehead.   A surge of massive information gushed out from the jade dip into He Song’s brain, imprinting swiftly into his memory, making it unforgettable.   This mass of information was a bit overwhelming, causing He Song to feel a momentary discomfort.   But quickly, his discomfort vanished.   With a potent soul, his ability to process this sudden explosion of information was naturally superior than that of others.   Just a moment passed.   He Song, who had been absorbing the information from the jade slip with his eyes closed, opened his eyes again.   All the information of the Array Tao Introduction contained within the jade slip had been deeply imprinted into his memory, in meticulous detail.   After reviewing all the contents related to the Array Tao Introduction in his mind and confirming that nothing had been missed, He Song then looked at Ping’er.   “Miss Ping’er, may I ask where does your pavilion procure its tea leaves?” Reminded of the incident where he gained cultivation progress just by drinking tea, He Song quickly asked.   In the Cultivation World, cultivation was the foundation of everything.   And this foundation had to be accumulated gradually over a long time.   Practising every day.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com   Using spirit stones to cultivate.   Eating elixirs by refining them into one’s spirit power.   All of these practices took time.   But interestingly, the tea leaves He Song had today didn’t fall into this category.

18 Chapter 18: Green Immortal Spirit Tea Translator: 549690339 Drinking tea could increase one’s cultivation level. By drinking a few cups every day, wouldn’t that amount to extra cultivation progress?   Even if the increase is minimal, it could accumulate to a significant amount over time.   Thus, He Song asked about it.   “This tea is precious. Even Master Steward can hardly get a sip on normal days. It is only served to the VIPs in a small pot. Today, thanks to Mr. He, I get to enjoy a cup myself.” The corners of Ping’er’s eyes crinkled as she looked at He Song with a hint of a smile.   If it weren’t for the fact that the tea was truly rare, and that He Song had offered her a cup, she wouldn’t have been so easily convinced that his actions weren’t intentional.   Now that He Song asked, she naturally answered everything she knew.   After a short pause, Ping’er spoke again.   “This tea is called Green Immortal Spirit Tea, which is harvested from the Green Immortal Spirit Tea trees grown in the Thick Earth Sect’s Spiritual Medicine Garden. It sells for ten spirit stones a tael in the Immortal Pavilion…”   “…”   “Thank you, Mr. He. I will take my leave now.” Having achieved his goal, He Song no longer had any desire to stay.   After bowing slightly to Ping’er, He Song turned and left the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   What?   Green Immortal Spirit Tea?   Don’t know.   Don’t recognize it.   Haven’t seen it before.   Can’t afford it!   Feeling a little disappointed,   He Song walked away quickly, as if there was a demonic beast chasing him from behind.   He needed to return home as soon as possible.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com   And then start comprehending the Array Tao Introduction that he had memorized.   Instead of facing Ping’er’s teasing laughter here.   He Song’s figure swiftly faded into the distance.   At the original spot,   Ping’er covered her face with both hands, laughing so hard that her body trembled.   She wasn’t laughing at He Song for overestimating his abilities, but simply found him interesting.   Anyone who cultivates immortality would understand the value of spirit tea that could increase cultivation levels.   But He Song just asked without hesitation.   Upon learning the price, he turned around and left without any desire for the tea.   Furthermore, He Song had only been in the Immortal Pavilion for five years,    but he had already reached the third-tier Qi Refining and saved up a hundred spirit stones.   He could even afford to spend a hundred spirit stones on the introductory Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   Plus, his casual handing over of a cup of spirit tea to her made Ping’er see him in a new light.   “If I see him again, I must make friends with him,” she thought.   Muttering to herself, Ping’er’s figure soon left the VIP room, continuing to attend to other cultivators.   He Song had left too quickly today.   She wanted to make friends, but due to her duties, she couldn’t leave. She could only wait for the next opportunity.   Back at home,   He Song sat cross-legged, and memories of the Array Tao Introduction immediately surged in his mind.   Array Tao, what is Array Tao?   In large scale, it uses the heavens and earth as the array, turning everything to dust under the infinite great power.   In small scale, it utilizes spirit stones to arrange the array, manipulating the spirit Qi to affect the prosperity of an area.   However, these were matters for the future.   As a beginner in Array Tao, He Song needed to have a basic understanding of it.   How to engrave array patterns on spirit stones.   How to use the special array-setting techniques.   How to observe the flow of spirit Qi between heaven and earth.   How to set up a real array.   These were the things that He Song needed to figure out right now.   Fortunately.   The information in Array Tao Introduction was very detailed.   As He Song’s eyes scanned through, bits and pieces of insight quickly appeared in his mind.   A spirit stone appeared in his hand, and He Song soon began to learn in a somewhat adept manner according to the memories in his mind.   …   In the blink of an eye, a day and night had passed.   The next morning.   He Song, deep in thought, walked out of his room and headed towards the spirit field he managed to begin using the Spirit Rain Skill.   Half an hour after using the Spirit Rain Skill, He Song’s footsteps paused for a moment before quickly changing direction and heading towards the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Today.   It was the agreed-upon monthly meeting time between He Song, Wei Fan, and Meng Guan.   On the first day of each month, the three of them would meet in the Spirit Construction Pavilion, have tea and chat, and discuss some of the things that happened within their respective small circles.action   Most of the various pieces of information He Song obtained came from here.    While heading towards the Spirit Construction Pavilion, He Song’s mind was constantly learning related knowledge about array tao.   After a day and night of learning, He Song already had some of his own understanding of array tao.   However, whether or not it was correct, he still needed time to verify.   Along the way.   He Song soon arrived at the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Upon entering the second floor of the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   An old man and a young man sat side by side on mats next to a table.   “Mr. He, you’re quite late today. Did you spend the night at Phoenix Perching Pavilion last night?” Seeing He Song, who seemed to be lost in thought, the elderly looking Meng Guan teased first.   Phoenix Perching Pavilion was a place of pleasure run by the Pure Yin Sect of the Golden Core Sect.   In Phoenix Perching Pavilion, the female cultivators were all stunning beauties, some of whom cultivated dual cultivation skills, and after dual cultivation with them, one’s own cultivation level could be increased.   It could be considered one of the few places in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion that could drain a cultivator’s resources.   “With Mr. He’s wealth, I’m sure he asked for a top token that can increase his cultivation level at Phoenix Perching Pavilion, right? Congratulations on your rapid progress, Mr. He. How wonderful and joyous!” Wei Fan, who appeared to be a young man, said with a flash in his eyes, shaking his head and laughing.   Although they knew He Song wouldn’t spend his spirit stones in such a place, the three of them had a great relationship and got along well, so they could joke around without any harm.   What’s more, Wei Fan had just used the Spirit Vision Skill and discovered that He Song had actually broken through to the third-tier Qi Refining.   That’s why he said this to tease him.   It was impossible for He Song to hide his breakthrough from the second-tier of Qi Refining to the third-tier from others.   But he didn’t plan on hiding it, anyway.   Hearing the teasing from his two friends, He Song didn’t rush to argue and sat down in his seat. Suddenly, he let out a sigh.   “Alas…”   The moment the sound came out.   The whole room was silent enough to hear a pin drop.   The two of them, who had wanted to say more, momentarily paused at the sight.   They exchanged glances and found astonished looks in each other’s eyes.   In the five years they had been together with He Song, he had never sat down so silently and then let out such a deep sigh like today.   Never, not once!   But what on earth had happened today to make He Song act so out of character?   Wei Fan gave Meng Guan a signal to ask.   Meng Guan touched his beard and accidentally pulled out a few strands, grimacing in pain.   However, with Wei Fan’s constant prompting, Meng Guan finally spoke up.   “Mr. He, has something happened?” Meng Guan gently asked as he placed a cup of tea beside He Song.   He looked as if he was afraid of startling He Song, the third-tier Qi Refining cultivator.   Seeing him like this, Wei Fan was speechless and face-palming.   Although he felt that Meng Guan was being overly cautious, Wei Fan still kept his eyes firmly locked on He Song.   If someone bullied his junior brother, where would he, as a Qi-refining late stage cultivator, put his face?   Perhaps he would have to step in and recover He Song’s pride.   After years of acquaintance, Wei Fan still had the intention to stand up for He Song.

19 Chapter 19: Red Spirit Gold Mine Translator: 549690339 I used to have no opportunity.   There was no way to show He Song my strength at the Qi-refining late stage.   But now it seems, perhaps my chance is right in front of me.   Thinking of how he hadn’t put his skills to the test since breaking through to the Qi-refining late stage, Wei Fan suddenly felt a bit eager.   Practitioners at the Qi-refining late stage are quite rare at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Even as a seventh-tier Qi Refining cultivator, he still belongs to the small handful of people at the top of the pyramid.   On ordinary days, people would show respect to him.   As a result, he hadn’t fought once since he broke through to the Qi-refining late stage.   But now things are different.   Seeing He Song’s state, it seemed that he might have a chance to show his skills.   Under the eager gaze of the two.   The expression on He Song’s face gradually became somber.   “It’s nothing, just that I spent a hundred spirit stones to buy an Introduction to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation, and I feel a bit melancholic about it.”   “Sigh, that was all my savings; I don’t know when I’ll truly get started with it.” With a still somber expression, He Song took the cup of tea Meng Guan handed him and drank it down.   Immediately after, the somberness on his face vanished.action   “Good tea.”   He Song didn’t know that Wei Fan was getting eager to stand up for him.   Everything he said and did was just a premeditated excuse.   Even if Wei Fan and the others were not teasing him as they did earlier, he would still act the same way.   First, he mentioned that he had bought an Introduction to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation.   But he didn’t say which type it was.   Then he said that the hundred spirit stones were all his wealth.   Now that he had spent all his money, he didn’t have to worry about being targeted by others.   Thus, achieving the best of both worlds.            It let people know that he had purchased an Introduction to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation, so he wouldn’t stand out too much when he showed off his other skills in the future.   And at the same time, it signaled that he was now dirt poor, having spent all his savings on the Introduction to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation. This way, no one would covet the meager spirit stones he had.   Based on He Song’s understanding of Wei Fan and the others over these five years, telling them was the same as telling the whole Immortal Pavilion.   Not for any other reason, only because these two are the kind of people who have many friends.   Meng Guan, as the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, is in charge of recruiting spiritual plant farmers and distributing spirit seeds. He has met countless cultivators, most of whom are spiritual plant farmers.   As for Wei Fan…   Wei Fan, being the Steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, deals with almost all the internal personnel of the Immortal Pavilion, and he also loves making friends.   As a result, Wei Fan’s connections in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion are incredibly strong.   With these two people, once they learned about his situation, he feared his status as a pauper would soon spread throughout the Immortal Pavilion.   Of course…   Although Wei Fan and the others have many friends, their true inner circle consists of only three people: He Song, Meng Guan, and Wei Fan.   The rest of the people are just connections and haven’t joined their small group.   Therefore, He Song only needed to use them to spread his news, and it would be a simple matter.   “Alright alright, I thought the girls at Phoenix Perching Pavilion were already fast at changing faces, but I didn’t expect you to be even faster. I, Meng Guan, am convinced.” The meaning in He Song’s words could not be concealed from these two seasoned Martial World members.   As a result, as soon as He Song’s words fell, Meng Guan began teasing him with winks and nudges.   “I’m convinced too. I thought there was a fight coming, but it turned out to be just a matter of words. You’re really not playing fair, kid.” Wei Fan also realized what was going on at this point, and his eagerness to stand up for He Song was suppressed.   They both understood the meaning between He Song’s words.   They could even summarize it in two phrases:   He bought an Introduction to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation.   He has no spirit stones left.   Beyond that, the expressions and face-changing speed were secondary.   “Alright, we know about this. Don’t worry, no one will dare to come after you. And even if they do, I’ll chop off their dog’s paws.”   In the end, Wei Fan waved his hand and completely dispelled He Song’s worries.   The words of a Qi-refining late stage practitioner still carried weight within the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   What He Song needed to guard against were merely Qi Refining Early Stage practitioners or, at most, those at the Qi-refining mid stage.   With a Qi-refining late stage practitioner like Wei Fan supporting him, He Song’s safety naturally increased significantly.            For that, He Song thanked him with a bow.   You had to make use of your connections when needed.   Otherwise, if someone really targeted him later, that would be a real problem.   Since he had backup, letting some information slip out could help avoid a lot of unnecessary trouble.   Cautiousness, that was the principle He Song had always followed.   He had an infinite lifespan, and he, of course, didn’t want his safety to be threatened in any way.   By doing so, he could keep himself inconspicuous while scaring off any outsiders who might cause trouble, killing two birds with one stone.   Having found He Song had no other issues, the conversation among the three quickly returned to normal.   He Song personally brewed tea.   Meanwhile, Wei Fan’s voice rang in his ears.   “You know about the mine that appeared near the Immortal Pavilion and how the Foundation Establishment clans were fighting over it, right?” As soon as he spoke, Wei Fan’s words aroused He Song and Meng Guan’s curiosity.   “Yes, I know. Didn’t the Thick Earth Sect take over the mine later? Is there any follow-up?” Meng Guan asked curiously.   He Song also looked over, wanting to hear what had happened next.   “Of course there’s a follow-up. After the Thick Earth Sect took over the mine, they found that the mine was of great value – a small Red Spirit Gold Mine.” Wei Fan paused halfway through his sentence and noticed that the two before him were puzzled. He then added another sentence.   “Red Spirit Gold can be used to refine Artifacts. A small Red Spirit Gold Mine, if converted into spirit stones, would be worth at least tens of thousands of spirit stones, or even more than a hundred thousand spirit stones.”   Upon hearing this…   The two who were initially puzzled were suddenly taken aback.   Meng Guan’s whiskers had grown a bit longer, but he didn’t notice.   He just kept muttering the words “tens of thousands of spirit stones” under his breath.   The greedy look in his eyes for spirit stones was almost overflowing.   He had been stuck at the sixth-tier Qi Refining stage for a long time, and the Breakthrough Elixir needed to advance from the Qi-refining mid stage to the late stage was extremely expensive. With his current savings, he feared that it would still take a long time to afford one.   Usually, when spending spirit stones, he wished he could split a single spirit stone in half and spend that.   Now, there was a mine worth at least tens of thousands of spirit stones nearby.   At this point, it was hard not to be greedy.   Fortunately, he still had some sense, knowing that this was not something a Qi-refining mid stage practitioner like him could touch.   So he just muttered about it, but didn’t take any action.   He Song’s hand, which was pouring the tea, couldn’t help shaking either.   Tens of thousands of spirit stones at the very least!   He had been in this world for more than five years, and the most spirit stones he had at any time was just over a hundred.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates   How many years would it take him to get that many spirit stones by farming?        

20 Chapter 20: The Pit of Fire Translator: 549690339 Thirty a year.   Three hundred in ten years.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com   Three thousand in a hundred years.   Thirty thousand in a thousand years.   In other words, if He Song’s income never increases, he would need to farm for a thousand years to save up thirty thousand spirit stones.   And this is only possible if He Song doesn’t eat or drink, doesn’t spend spirit stones on cultivation, and doesn’t spend spirit stones on socializing.   A thousand years… wouldn’t the vegetables be cold by then?   Although he had an endless lifespan, it wasn’t meant to be wasted like this.   With a thought, He Song threw away the idea and continued to listen attentively.   “Now, the Thick Earth Sect is recruiting loose cultivators for mining. Every loose cultivator who goes in to mine for a month can get thirty spirit stones as wages.”   As Wei Fan’s words came again.   The two, who were already somewhat shocked, suddenly widened their eyes again.   Thirty spirit stones a month? Isn’t that three hundred and sixty spirit stones a year?   This income.   It’s much higher than the income of the spiritual plant farmer inside the Immortal Pavilion.   As a spiritual plant farmer within the Immortal Pavilion, He Song could only get a hundred and fifty spirit stones after working tirelessly for a year.action   After deducting the rent, he only had thirty spirit stones left to spend freely.   But now,   Just any loose cultivator that goes mining could have an annual income of three hundred and sixty spirit stones.   As long as they don’t live in the Immortal Pavilion.   The income of those loose cultivators is entirely at their disposal.   The gap between thirty spirit stones and three hundred and sixty spirit stones is more than ten times!   While calculating all this in his mind, He Song suddenly felt that the thirty spirit stones he gets in a year were not so attractive anymore.   He worked hard for a year to get thirty spirit stones.   Others can get thirty spirit stones within a month as a loose cultivator.   The difference between the two is like heaven and earth.   With such calculations,   Going to the nearby Red Spirit Gold Mine Mountain to mine is like picking up spirit stones in a sack!   “Unfortunately, they only recruit loose cultivators there. We, who are internal cultivators of the Immortal Pavilion, are not allowed to enter. Sigh.” Wei Fan seemed to have sensed their intentions and immediately poured cold water on them.    Taking a sip of tea, Wei Fan continued.   “Don’t even think about leaving the Immortal Pavilion. It’s easy to leave, but it’s hard to get back in. When you become a loose cultivator, it won’t be as stable as it is now.”   As soon as his words fell,   Meng Guan, who was already somewhat tempted, picked up the teacup next to him, frowned, and drank it all directly.   He Song kept his eyes on his nose and his nose on his heart, without saying anything.   But in his heart, he had already made up his mind.   The Thick Earth Sect is recruiting loose cultivator miners and is offering thirty spirit stones as wages for a month’s work.   This indicates that due to the immense value of the mine, the Thick Earth Sect wants to complete the mining as soon as possible.   As for whether there is any danger in the mine,   He Song wouldn’t know.   However, having experienced the era of information explosion in his previous life, He Song is always cautious about everything.   There must be something odd about hiring loose cultivator miners at such high prices.   Moreover, the Thick Earth Sect only recruits loose cultivator miners and does not recruit internal personnel from the Immortal Pavilion to mine, which has an unclear intention.   The Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion is not far from that mine.   If they really want to excavate quickly, their own people from within the Immortal Pavilion would be more trustworthy.   In that case, still only recruiting loose cultivator miners…   The greed in He Song’s eyes completely vanished at this moment.   This mine.   Definitely can’t go!   He had made up his mind, and at this moment, the weight in his heart was finally lifted.   It was true that miners could earn more spirit stones, but even if they earned more spirit stones, they would still need their lives to spend them.   You have your eyes on the rich reward.   Others might have their eyes on your life.   Between the light and the heavy, He Song naturally understood in his heart.   As an everlasting being, living longer was his greatest advantage.   If he still took risks for some cultivation resources like other cultivators, he would be a rather incompetent everlasting being.   Other cultivators fought life and death for cultivation resources because their lives were short, and not fighting would mean death.   But he had already gained everlasting life, which made him completely different from them.   He casually poured a cup of tea for Meng Guan and pushed the teacup in front of him.   At this moment.   Meng Guan, with an old face, looked very struggling.    He had been stuck in the Qi-refining mid stage for far too long.   So long that he himself felt that his mindset had aged, turning himself into an old man.   But now.   An opportunity to earn a large amount of spirit stones was right in front of him.   However, to seize this opportunity, he would have to give up his identity as an insider in the Immortal Pavilion and become a loose cultivator.   This was a result he could not accept at all.   The gap between the cultivators inside the Immortal Pavilion and loose cultivators was actually extremely wide.   The mortality rate of loose cultivators was high.   No one would avenge a loose cultivator after they were harmed.   Loose cultivators had a very low status, so low that anyone could step on them.   The resources available to loose cultivators were also very limited.   However, being a cultivator within the Immortal Pavilion, none of these issues would exist.   Cultivating in peace.   Resources allocated monthly or yearly.   Friends avenging you after being wronged.   A high status within the Immortal Pavilion, even treating loose cultivators with disdain.   Such a strong contrast made Meng Guan both want to earn a high amount of spirit stones and reluctant to give up his identity as a member of the Immortal Pavilion.   That was the reason for his struggle at the moment.   “Lao Meng, don’t think too much about it. Save up spirit stones in peace, and when the time is right, we will go to Green Wall Immortal City together to buy you a Breakthrough Elixir,” Wei Fan, seeing Meng Guan’s struggle, immediately said softly.   “Wei brother is right, let’s save up spirit stones slowly. Who knows, by the time we have enough spirit stones, maybe we will have already broken through on our own,” He Song said, consoling him as well.   Meng Guan could be considered as He Song’s guide in the Cultivation World.   If Meng Guan hadn’t casually given his former self a copy of “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill,” He Song might have become a loose cultivator as soon as he crossed over.   The survival of loose cultivators in the Cultivation World was much worse than that of spiritual plant farmers.   Not to mention breaking through to the third-tier Qi Refining within five years.   It was still a question whether he could break through to the second-tier of Qi Refining within five years.   Moreover, He Song had never experienced the various dangers that loose cultivators had to face.   In this sense, Meng Guan indeed had a great kindness towards He Song, although he didn’t know it himself.   But He Song had to remember this point.   Being clear-minded was also one of the elements in cultivating immortality.   Now that he saw Meng Guan wanting to jump into the pit of the Red Spirit Gold Mine Mountain, He Song would certainly try to persuade him as long as it didn’t affect himself.   Although mining in the mountain could earn more.   Their lives might not be guaranteed.   At the same time, they would also have to resign from their positions in the Immortal Pavilion.   To pay such a heavy price and jump into the pit, if He Song didn’t persuade him and watched Meng Guan fall into the pit, he would feel guilty.

21 Chapter 21: Time Waits for No One! Translator: 549690339 After a long while.   An aged voice finally emerged from Meng Guan’s mouth.   “Sigh, Breakthrough Elixirs are so hard to come by…” he sighed.   Meng Guan shook his head, picked up the teacup beside him but did not drink, his brows tightly furrowed as if he still did not want to give up this opportunity.   He had been stuck in the sixth-tier Qi Refining for so long.   He knew full well that he only needed to slowly accumulate spirit stones, and he would be able to go to the Green Wall Immortal City to buy a Breakthrough Elixir.   But… as a cultivator of the Immortal Pavilion with no power or influence, once he arrived at the Green Wall Immortal City, his treatment would be no different from ordinary loose cultivators.   Immortal Pavilion cultivators only have some privileges within their own Immortal Pavilion.   In a higher-level Immortal City, compared to true disciples of a Golden Elixir Great Faction, what difference is there between Immortal Pavilion cultivators and ordinary loose cultivators?   At most, they know a bit more than loose cultivators.   They have a fixed residence.   And a stable income, that’s all.   When it comes to their actual fighting abilities, Immortal Pavilion cultivators aren’t even generally as good as those loose cultivators who have licked blood off their blades.   Moreover.   The journey to the Immortal City to purchase a Breakthrough Elixir is not so smooth either.   Not to mention the various dangers on the way to Green Wall Immortal City.   Even if he arrived at the Green Wall Immortal City without any obstacles, would he have enough spirit stones on him to bid for a Breakthrough Elixir?   Even if he was lucky enough to obtain a Breakthrough Elixir, he would immediately be targeted by others.   With the Breakthrough Elixir in hand, he would have to be careful on his return journey.   However, there is a solution to this: by paying some spirit stones to stay in an inn in the Immortal City, and then using the Breakthrough Elixir to advance his cultivation level, he could resolve the issue.   But who could guarantee that after bidding for the Breakthrough Elixir, he would still have enough spirit stones left to stay in an inn?   If he wanted to make everything foolproof, the time needed for saving up spirit stones would be extended once more.   By then, even if he managed to break through to the Qi-refining late stage with the aid of the Breakthrough Elixir, he would have no time to touch the Foundation Establishment realm.   For ordinary cultivators,   Establishing one’s Foundation before the age of sixty is optimal.   Starting from the age of sixty, the difficulty of Foundation Establishment increases and the success rate decreases.   If one fails to cultivate to the perfection of the ninth-tier Qi Refining before the age of sixty, and also obtain a Foundation Establishment Elixir,            It means that there is almost no hope of establishing the Foundation in this lifetime.   Unless one has exceptionally good luck, he can succeed in Foundation Establishment after the age of sixty.   But that is just a rare occurrence.   Not even a few appear in a hundred years.   Meng Guan is already forty-three, with his current savings, if he hurries up and takes a risk, maybe he can still touch the threshold of Foundation Establishment.   If he doesn’t take the risk and continues to delay like now, the Qi-refining late stage might be his limit in this lifetime.   This is the reason why Meng Guan is so conflicted in his heart.   The life in the Immortal Pavilion, where one can see the end in just one glance, truly puts great pressure on him.   Meanwhile.   He Song and Wei Fan exchanged glances, both seeing a hint of helplessness in each other’s eyes.   Having known each other for so many years, He Song and Wei Fan had a good understanding of Meng Guan.   At the moment, it seemed that Meng Guan’s heart was still wavering and undecided.   Although the two had advised him before, they also knew the dilemma Meng Guan faced at the moment.   Should he take the risk and seek a chance to establish his Foundation?   Or should he hold back and stay in the Qi-refining late stage for the rest of his life?action   This question is indeed difficult to answer.   At the same time, He Song and Wei Fan didn’t feel comfortable persuading him any further now.   If they needed to say something, once would be enough. If he could take it to heart, he would naturally do so.   But if they said too much, it would inevitably annoy him and do more harm than good.   Again, hindering someone’s path to success is like killing their parents. Only if the relationship between the three of them was extremely good could they make a suggestion.   If their relationship wasn’t this good, even just based on their past interactions, Meng Guan might have fallen out with the other two.   Time passed bit by bit.   He Song poured another cup of tea for each of them.   Meng Guan still didn’t drink, his brow furrowed, lost in his world.   Wei Fan picked up his teacup and gestured to He Song. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t hide the reluctance in his eyes.   He Song did the same, holding up his teacup and gesturing to Wei Fan, feeling a similar sense of reluctance deep within him.   He had advised as much as he could, and so had Wei Fan, but sadly, Meng Guan was still struggling in his heart.   So it had come to this.   He Song could only wait for the final result of Meng Guan’s struggle.            Regardless of whether the outcome was good or bad, all he could do was bless him, rather than forcefully try to persuade him.   Blocking someone’s path to success was no joking matter.   Even if he knew that the Red Spirit Gold Mine was a pit of fire, He Song could not use his own speculation to stop Meng Guan any further.   This was the path he had chosen for himself.   “Perhaps, with Meng Guan’s sixth-tier Qi Refining ability, he can protect himself in the Red Spirit Gold Mine.”   This thought flashed through He Song’s mind.   His gaze, however, collided with Wei Fan’s worried eyes.   For a moment, both men fell silent, not knowing what to do.   After a long silence.   It was only then that Meng Guan opened his eyes, downing the tea in one gulp.   With a gulp, Meng Guan grinned.   “Hahaha, I, Meng Guan, possess the Five Spirits Roots and have been cultivating in the Thick Earth Mansion since I was young. Unfortunately, due to my mediocre aptitude, I couldn’t enter the outer gate of the Thick Earth Sect, and was sent to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.”   “I thought I would never be able to reach the Foundation Establishment stage in this life, but I didn’t expect to come across such a chance!” Like he was talking to himself or stating a fact, Meng Guan’s voice carried a multitude of emotions.   At this moment, He Song’s face was heavy, and he felt increasingly uneasy.   Wei Fan, too, wanted to say something but hesitated, his anxiety showing on his face.   “Time waits for no one! Instead of letting time slip away, it’s better to take a bold step forward and seize the opportunity!” Finally, under He Song and Wei Fan’s watchful gaze, Meng Guan resolutely pronounced these words.   At this moment, Meng Guan’s face was filled with determination.   His right hand clutched the teacup tightly, oblivious to the fact that it was beginning to shatter piece by piece.   A ray of sunlight shone in through the window, falling right on Meng Guan’s hand.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com   It was as if he was holding the sunlight in his hand.   Silence.   He Song fell silent.   Wei Fan was also silent.   For a moment, the entire room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, except for the faint sound of the three men’s breathing.   After a while.   “Lao Meng, we don’t know when we’ll see each other again after this parting. Is there anything you want us to take care of?” Seeing Meng Guan’s resolute decision, He Song knew that persuasion was useless and stopped trying. Instead, he asked about other matters.   The Red Spirit Gold Mine was extremely dangerous, and Meng Guan’s chances of survival were slim.   Even though his cultivation level had reached the sixth-tier of Qi Refining, and he had accumulated a significant amount of spirit stones in the Immortal Pavilion, as well as a variety of artifacts and spirit amulets, He Song still couldn’t be sure if he would come back alive.   Instead of trying to discourage Meng Guan’s morale by persuading him further, it was better to ask if he needed any other help.   On the side.   Wei Fan’s face turned pale upon hearing these words, but then seemed to remember something and suddenly froze.   He opened his mouth to say something, but in the end, he only let out a sigh.   He also realized that at this point, further persuasion would only cast a shadow in Meng Guan’s heart. It was better to clear away his worries, which might even increase his chances of survival.        

22 Chapter 22: Trouble Translator: 549690339 Although He Song’s actions seemed impulsive, they actually became the best response to Meng Guan.   If it were him…   He wouldn’t have thought of that before He Song spoke up.   As he pondered these thoughts, a hint of admiration appeared in Wei Fan’s eyes when he looked at He Song.   This was someone who genuinely considered his friends’ well-being.   No wonder he was such a good friend for the past five years!   On the other side.   Hearing He Song’s words, Meng Guan was stunned.   He had thought that He Song wanted to persuade him again at first, and he had already prepared his refusal.   But to his surprise, He Song didn’t try to persuade him. Instead, he offered to help him deal with his worries.   This…   Glancing at Wei Fan, who remained silent, he looked back at the sincere He Song.   A warmth formed in Meng Guan’s heart.   Although his aptitude might have been lacking, the friends he had made were top-notch.   However, since He Song had already asked, Meng Guan thought for a moment and quickly shook his head.   “I was raised in Thick Earth Mansion and have no relatives. Besides the two of you as my good friends in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, I don’t have any partners, so there’s no need for the trouble.”   “But if I achieve great things in the future, I will never forget the two of you!” In the end, Meng Guan stood up and deeply bowed to He Song and Wei Fan.   Seeing this, both He Song and Wei Fan hastily stood up as well.   They returned the bow.   When they sat down again, the three of them talked casually, but each had their own thoughts.   Meng Guan envisioned his future.   After today, he would resign as the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion in Immortal Pavilion.   He would go to the Red Spirit Gold Mine to mine spirit stones, save them up and buy a Breakthrough Elixir in Green Wall Immortal City after he had enough of them.   With the means he had accumulated over the years, he was confident in his success rate.   Once he broke through to seventh-tier Qi Refining, reaching the Qi-refining late stage.action   He believed that he could become a powerhouse among Red Spirit Gold.   In this way, his chances of survival would increase rapidly.   At that time…    Even if he couldn’t catch a glimpse of the Foundation Establishment Realm, a Qi-refining late stage Loose Cultivator would still live well even if he lost his status as an inner disciple of the Immortal Pavilion and left the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   This was his plan; as long as he could break through to the Qi-refining late stage as soon as possible, the sky would be the limit.   Meanwhile, Wei Fan was worried about Meng Guan’s relatively poor aptitude and the fact that he had been stuck at sixth-tier Qi Refining for a while, wanting to take risks to change his destiny.   But his spirit roots were only four spirits roots, making it incredibly difficult to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. Would he go or not if he were given a chance to take risks when he’s over fifty?   He had this in mind.   Meng Guan needed to take risks.   In the future…   Unaware of what was on the minds of the other two, He Song didn’t think much at the moment.   Meng Guan had made up his mind and couldn’t be persuaded.   He offered to help take care of any potential concerns, but Meng Guan had no family and thus had no concerns.   In this case…   Since he had tried his best but still couldn’t change the outcome, there was no need for him to interfere anymore.Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)   Although he knew that the Red Spirit Gold Mine was dangerous…   That was where Meng Guan wanted to go.   No amount of persuasion could stop him.   So be it. He hoped that Meng Guan, favored by fortune, would turn misfortune into blessing.   With Meng Guan’s sixth-tier Qi Refining, He Song thought there was still a little hope.   …   After a hearty chat,   The three of them each went their separate ways.   Walking along the bustling street, He Song let out a slight sigh.   His footsteps paused briefly but immediately continued toward his home.   Today, he had received quite a few messages.   He needed to go home and sort them out to see if there were any connections between them.   At the same time, he needed to assess the safety of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   If the safety level dropped, He Song would have to leave, no matter what, and not stay here any longer.   With so much on his mind,   He Song quickly returned home.   Making himself a pot of tea, he sat down at the only table in his house.   Five years had passed, but his surroundings hadn’t changed, with no additional furniture or missing items.    Everything seemed to be as it was five years ago.   Aside from his cultivation progress from first-tier Qi Refining to third-tier Qi Refining, nothing else seemed to have changed.   “Meng Guan is about to step down from his role as the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion. This position has nothing to do with me. Although the annual salary is high, I am too weak to compete for it.”   He had found out about Meng Guan’s impending departure in advance.   But this news had little value to He Song.   On the contrary, He Song no longer had any acquaintances in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion due to Meng Guan’s departure.   However, with the support of Wei Fan, who was in the late stage of Qi Refining, He Song was not worried that someone in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion would give him any trouble even after Meng Guan left.   Basically, Meng Guan’s departure did no good or significant harm to He Song.   That’s it.   As he thought so, He Song sighed again in his heart.   The gatherings of the three friends from the Spirit Construction Pavilion would probably be reduced to just two.   He had been friends with Meng Guan for five years, but their future meetings remained uncertain.   This sudden realization left He Song feeling somewhat lost.   But soon, he recovered.   “There will be plenty more of these in the future. Just get used to it.” A glint of light flashed in his eyes as He Song secretly thought.   As an everlasting being, he would surely experience many more farewells like this one.   At first, he would indeed feel a little disappointed.   But as he experienced more of them, he would naturally accept them.   As He Song thought, he began to sort through the various pieces of information he knew in his mind.   He tried to deduce whether Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was an appropriate place to continue living by analyzing the information he had.   This was something He Song did every month.   Even though it seemed a bit redundant, it actually helped him avoid many troubles.   “The Red Spirit Gold Mine seems to be troublesome. Even the Thick Earth Sect wants to mine it quickly to avoid any risks. I’ll observe the situation first. If things go south, I’ll make a quick escape.”   After combing through all the information, He Song came to a conclusion.   Recently, there haven’t been many severe incidents or major events around Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Aside from the Red Spirit Gold Mine, the overall situation was relatively calm.   But even so, He Song decided to keep an eye on the developments at the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   Once things looked unfavorable, he could make a quick escape.   After making preparations for a possible departure, He Song pondered for a moment before finally closing his eyes and starting his cultivation.   Time flew by.   In the blink of an eye, a night had passed.   The next morning,   He Song was still cultivating when a paper crane flew through the window at an incredible speed and stopped in front of him in the blink of an eye.   The paper crane’s wings flapped as waves of spirit power emerged from its body, instantly waking up the cultivating He Song.

23 Chapter 23: Talisman Master Zhao Lin Translator: 549690339 Opening his eyes.   He Song’s gaze immediately locked onto the paper crane in front of him.   Although the paper crane was made of paper, it contained spirit power, appearing unremarkable, but there was something extraordinary about it.   The paper crane originated from one of the three basic skills, the Sound Transmission Skill.   Of course, true sound transmission was somewhat unrealistic, but by folding a piece of paper with written words into a paper crane and infusing it with spirit power, attaching the person’s aura and having the paper crane swiftly reach the person’s side.   The paper crane created by the Sound Transmission Skill was extremely fast and intercepting it was as difficult as reaching the sky.   Moreover, since the paper crane was made of paper with written words on it, once it arrived, the content of the letter would naturally arrive as well.   Thus, it was regarded to have long-distance communication ability.   Reaching out to take the paper crane, He Song’s fingertips emitted a trace of spirit power.   And just after sensing He Song’s fingertip’s spirit power, the paper crane that initially seemed alive suddenly transformed into an ordinary paper crane, no longer possessing its extreme speed and agility.   The next moment, a piece of paper with some writing appeared in He Song’s hand.   “Mr. He, I, Meng Guan, do not know when I will return from this trip, and the outcome is uncertain. Although I originally intended for you to take over my position, the Upper Leader did not agree. Helplessly, I could only suggest another Qi-refining fourth-tier cultivator whom I am acquainted with.”   “However, rest assured, that cultivator is named Zhao Lin, and he has a good relationship with me. Before leaving, I instructed him to take care of you. His personality is similar to yours, both being cautious; I believe you won’t have too much difficulty in getting along.”   “In addition, Zhao Lin is proficient in Amulet Tao. If you need anything, feel free to seek him out.”   “Meng Guan.”   Gazing over the lines of writing on the paper in his hand, He Song remained silent.   Meng Guan had left.   After handing over his duties and packing up his belongings, he left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion overnight.   As to why he was in such a hurry to leave.   To the point of not even allowing He Song and Wei Fan to host a farewell banquet for him.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels   The reason was something He Song could only guess.   Firstly, the earlier he left for the Red Spirit Gold Mine, the sooner he could begin earning spirit stones.   Secondly, farewells were always sentimental, so rather than making all three of them uncomfortable, it was better to leave without saying goodbye and spare some parting sorrow.   Thirdly…   Setting down the letter in his hand, He Song thought for a moment and decided not to discard it in the end.   Folding the paper and putting it away, He Song placed the letter in his meditation room.    Carrying it on his person was too prone to damage, and He Song didn’t possess any storage bags. Naturally, he could only store it in his meditation room for the time being and transfer it somewhere else later.   With these thoughts in mind, He Song looked out of the window.   At this time, the sky was bright, but the sun had not fully risen yet.   Threads of early morning mist enveloped the surroundings, obstructing the view.   However, voices were already coming from outside, and the cultivators of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion would soon begin their new day.   Getting up.   Cooking.   After finishing his meal, He Song first went to the Stall Section to pick out some amulet ink, then carried the ink to the residence of the person named Zhao Lin mentioned in Meng Guan’s letter.   Naturally, He Song didn’t want to give up on the connections Meng Guan had left for him.   As a spiritual plant farmer, he was afraid that he would have to spend quite some time under the person named Zhao Lin from now on.   In this way, visiting him right after Meng Guan had just left and the awe of his presence still lingered, it was unlikely the other party wouldn’t give face.   After all, Meng Guan had given his position to Zhao Lin and explicitly entrusted him to take care of He Song.   If Zhao Lin ignored this, his character would be immediately questioned by others.   Before leaving, Meng Guan had a cultivation of sixth-tier Qi Refining.   As for Zhao Lin now, his cultivation was of fourth-tier Qi Refining.   Although they were both in the Qi-refining mid-stage, one had just stepped in, and the other had been cultivating for many years; they couldn’t be compared.   Furthermore, with his character being questioned, it was likely that Zhao Lin’s position wouldn’t be too comfortable.   Thus, the chances of Zhao Lin giving He Song a hard time were slim, and he might even take more care of him because of Meng Guan’s relationship.   While He Song walked, various thoughts flashed in his mind, but his pace was not slow. Soon, he arrived at Zhao Lin’s residence.   Just like He Song.   Zhao Lin also lived in the rented houses of the Immortal Pavilion.   Zhao Lin’s home wasn’t far from He Song’s.   It was only a few minutes away.   Standing in front of Zhao Lin’s door, He Song gently knocked.]   Knock, knock, knock~   With the sound of the knocks, a strange noise suddenly came from the quiet room.   However, after a while, a cautious voice came out.   “Who is it?” Inside the room, Zhao Lin held several Thick Earth Amulets with an uncertain expression on his face.    Last night.   An old friend who had been fairly good to him suddenly left and also left the position in Spiritual Medicine Pavilion to him.   This made him, who had been just a small spiritual plant farmer, feel like he had ascended to the heavens all at once, obtaining the role of managing the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   It should be known that although spiritual plant farmers were internal staff of the Immortal Pavilion, they had no power and were merely farming all year round.   However, the position of Spiritual Medicine Pavilion manager was entirely different.   Meng Guan, as the manager, had the authority to include spiritual plant farmers and distribute spirit seeds.   Who could be the spiritual plant farmers.   Who could obtain better spirit seeds.   All these matters were entirely up to Meng Guan’s decision.   Now that Meng Guan had yielded his position to Zhao Lin, these responsibilities naturally fell onto him.   Although the monthly salary of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion manager wasn’t high, if one accounted for the gray income, the income was much more than what he made farming all year.   However, wherever there were people, there was the Martial World.   The position of Spiritual Medicine Pavilion manager with its considerable income was also eyed by many people.   Now that Zhao Lin had suddenly risen to power, who knew what those people were thinking.   And his cultivation level had only just broken through to the fourth-tier of Qi Refining, which didn’t possess the true battle prowess of the Qi-refining mid-stage.   Therefore, when someone suddenly came knocking on the door, Zhao Lin’s first thought was to take out his Thick Earth Amulet for self-preservation from his body.   “Fellow Daoist Zhao Lin, I am He Song. Lao Meng should have mentioned me to you last night. I am here today to pay you a visit and hope you will be willing to see me.”   Outside the door, He Song, holding the amulet ink, spoke loudly.   In his hands, the amulet ink naturally served as the initial gift to be given to Zhao Lin on their first meeting.   He felt relatively at ease with the connections left by Meng Guan.   On the way, He Song had already prepared for a long-term interaction with Zhao Lin.   For a moment, there was silence in the room.   He Song sensed a wisp of gaze sweeping over him from a hidden place.   After that, the door of the room finally opened.   “So it’s Fellow Daoist He. Brother Meng did indeed instruct me last night. Please come in quickly.” Zhao Lin had a trace of embarrassment on his face as he swiftly invited He Song in while speaking.   Closing the door.   Entering the room.   Within the room.   He Song and Zhao Lin sat down, one on each side of the messy desk.action   A cup of hot tea was soon brought over by Zhao Lin and placed next to He Song.   “Fellow Daoist He, rest assured that since you are Brother Meng’s good friend, you are naturally my good friend as well. If you have any concerns in the future, feel free to bring them up to me anytime.” Though it was their first meeting, Zhao Lin seemed quite enthusiastic at the moment.   It seemed that his good relationship with Meng Guan was not false.

24 Chapter 24: Gifts Translator: 549690339 Seeing this, He Song secretly nodded in his heart, picked up the teacup and placed it in front of him, but he didn’t drink it.   It’s better to be cautious with first-time encounters.   However, He Song listened to Zhao Lin’s words and became slightly interested in the relationship between him and Meng Guan.   In the small circle formed by He Song, Meng Guan, and Wei Fan.   Meng Guan’s nickname was Lao Meng, and both He Song and Wei Fan called him that.   Wei Fan didn’t have a nickname, so both He Song and Meng Guan called him Wei.   As for He Song, due to his cultivation level and age, both Wei Fan and Meng Guan called him Mr. He.   It wasn’t that they were distant, but He Song didn’t like being called Little He or Little Song, and the other two were older than him, so after some discussion, they always called each other Mr. He.   Now, hearing Zhao Lin calling Meng Guan Meng-brother.   He Song immediately understood.   The relationship between Zhao Lin and Meng Guan was good, but it hadn’t reached the level for him to join their small circle.   However, it should be very close.   If Meng Guan hadn’t left suddenly, maybe in a few years, their small circle of three would have one more person.   With thoughts flashing through his mind, He Song’s hands were not slow.   He placed the amulet ink he had been holding in his hand on the table.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com   He Song looked at the messy desk in front of him, thinking that he had brought the right thing this time.   This messy desk seemed to be Zhao Lin’s workspace for amulet making, filled with various tools for the job.   At a glance, an impressive amulet pen.   A few plates of dark red unknown amulet ink.   And sheets of amulet paper scattered everywhere.   The existence of these items made the table in front of him extraordinarily messy.   “Sorry for the intrusion. I’ve heard from Lao Meng before that Mr. Zhao is good at making amulets, so I brought some amulet ink as a gift. I hope you don’t mind.” He Song pushed the amulet ink towards Zhao Lin, speaking as he did so.   Meng Guan’s letter did mention that Zhao Lin was good at making amulets.    He Song was just catering to his preferences, and bought some amulet ink at the Stall Section.   It’s not something very valuable, but it’s better than showing up empty-handed.   “I appreciate the gift, Mr. He. If you ever need spirit amulets in the future, feel free to come and find me. As long as I can make them, I’ll make sure you don’t suffer any losses.” Zhao Lin took the amulet ink and secretly glanced at it, his enthusiasm in his eyes increased.   Although he didn’t lack amulet ink, there was a significant difference between buying it himself and receiving it as a gift from someone else.   When he was a spiritual plant farmer, no one would give him gifts, and he couldn’t even find a way to give gifts to others.   Now, with He Song’s visit and gift, his heart was genuinely pleased.   After accepting the gift, the two became acquainted.   Recalling Meng Guan’s instructions to look after He Song before leaving, Zhao Lin had some guesses about He Song’s relationship with him.   Perhaps, He Song could enlighten him.   With this thought in his mind, Zhao Lin immediately asked, “By the way, Mr. He, do you know why Meng-brother suddenly left? He looked hurried, as if he had something urgent, but I didn’t ask for details because I was a bit drowsy at the time…”   In the end, an awkward expression flashed across Zhao Lin’s face.   It wasn’t that he didn’t ask because he was drowsy.   He was just stunned by the sudden pie in the sky, so he didn’t ask at all.   Before last night, he couldn’t imagine Meng Guan would suddenly leave and hand over his duties to him.   As a result, he was bewildered all night and didn’t come to his senses until this morning.   “That’s not a secret. In a few days, Mr. Zhao will naturally know.” Instead of answering Zhao Lin’s question, He Song saw that his goal had been achieved and didn’t continue to stay.   Therefore, after reluctantly responding to Zhao Lin for a while, He Song quickly bid farewell and left.   The news of the Red Spirit Gold Mine was indeed not a secret.   However, He Song wouldn’t share some insider information with a newly acquainted cultivator.   His source of information was Wei Fan, who could definitely obtain more accurate information compared to ordinary cultivators.   But in a few days, the news of the Red Spirit Gold Mine recruiting loose cultivator miners would certainly spread throughout the Immortal Pavilion.   At that time, it was uncertain how the loose cultivators and internal cultivators of the Immortal Pavilion would react.   By then, Zhao Lin would naturally understand the reason for Meng Guan’s departure.   There was no need for him to say anything in advance.   After bidding farewell to Zhao Lin.   It took He Song a few minutes to return to his doorstep.    Glancing at the neighbor’s house, a thoughtful expression flashed in He Song’s eyes.   In Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   He Song knew quite a few people.   However, very few could be called good friends.   Wei Fan, Meng Guan, Lin Cong, these three were the only close friends He Song had in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Lin Cong, the burly man living next to He Song.   As a loose cultivator, he relied on partnering with others to hunt demonic beasts for a living and had extraordinary combat strength.   He Song even had to rely on Wei Fan, a Qi-refining late stage cultivator, as his backer because of Lin Cong’s formidable strength.   Fortunately, the other party didn’t harbor any malicious intentions.   Now, they had known each other for more than five years.   Over these five years, their relationship had developed from mere neighbors to good friends who could chat freely.   They often sat together for tea and talked about interesting experiences they’d had.   “It’s been… half a month since we last saw each other, right?” He Song thought in his mind, trying to remember the last time he saw Lin Cong.   Half a month’s time could pass in the blink of an eye in ordinary circumstances.   However, He Song clearly remembered that half a month ago, Lin Cong had come to him and said that he was about to break through the fourth-tier of Qi Refining.   Having not seen him for half a month, He Song didn’t know whether Lin Cong had successfully broken through.   His gaze lingered on Lin Cong’s house for a moment, but He Song shook his head and decided not to disturb him.   If he went over now and happened to interrupt Lin Cong’s crucial breakthrough, it might affect their relationship and make things awkward.   Once Lin Cong successfully reached the Qi-refining mid stage, he could congratulate him later.   With these thoughts in mind, He Song was about to enter his house when a door-opening sound suddenly came to his ears.action   He Song looked in the direction of the sound.   He discovered, however, that it wasn’t Lin Cong who opened the door, but his other neighbor.   Lin Cong lived on the left side of his house, and this family lived on the right side.   “Hello, Song!” a childish voice greeted He Song.   “Mr. He, just got back?” The old man held the little girl’s hand and smiled as he greeted He Song.   This old man and the young girl moved in two years ago.   The neighbor who used to live to the right of He Song’s house had some connection with He Song, but one day, the neighbor hurriedly left and never returned. Since then, He Song had never seen him again.   It wasn’t until a month later, when this old man and the young girl moved in, that He Song had to accept the sudden change of neighbors.   As for the original neighbor, whether he was alive or dead, He Song didn’t know.

25 Chapter 25: Osmanthus Pavilion Translator: 549690339 However, judging by the urgency of the other party when they left, He Song had a feeling that things probably didn’t bode well for them.   The high mortality rate among loose cultivators was no joking matter.   As for the old man and the little girl who had recently moved in, the old man had a kind and gentle demeanor, and the little girl was lively and adorable. He Song became somewhat acquainted with them.   The old man was named Su Jin.   The little girl was named Su Yan.   They were grandfather and granddaughter.   According to Su Jin, Su Yan was his biological granddaughter from the mortal world.   Since she had a spirit root, he brought her from the mortal world and taught her personally.   In the Cultivation World, most cultivation families came about in this way.   Now, the old man and the little girl represented the beginnings of a cultivation family.   This bloodline-based family was extremely reliable. If a few more cultivators with spirit roots were to emerge,   there might be another new cultivation family in the Cultivation World.   “Little Yan is so well-behaved; Song will bring you some snacks next time.” Squeezing Su Yan’s little face, He Song responded to her while glancing at Su Jin.   “I visited a friend today, Sir Su; are you going to set up a stall?” With his sixth-tier Qi Refining, it was only natural for He Song to address Su Jin as ‘Sir’.   Similarly, although Su Jin seemed old and his age was indeed quite high, he actually worked as a loose cultivator, which was similar to Lin Cong.   Lin Cong had a low cultivation base, so he had to cooperate with others to hunt demonic beasts in the outside world to earn spirit stones.   However, Su Jin was different. With his sixth-tier Qi Refining, he had plenty of artifacts and spirit amulets and often engaged in combat.   Thus, even if he went out alone, he could still kill demonic beasts and earn spirit stones.   Moreover, all the proceeds from killing demonic beasts went to him alone.   This allowed him to earn a lot more spirit stones than the average person.   As for the stall mentioned by He Song, it referred to the practice of Su Jin hunting demonic beasts and then selling their corpses at a stall in the Immortal Pavilion.   “Mhm, Little Yan wanted to go out and have fun, so I’m taking her to the Stall Section to play.” With an indulgent look at Su Yan, Su Jin nodded at He Song, signaling to leave first.   He Song bowed his hand in acknowledgment.   Only Su Yan, even though Su Jin was dragging her away, still had her eyes glued to He Song.   Later, when they had walked far away, she would still occasionally turn back and glance at He Song.   It seemed as if she was checking whether He Song actually had any snacks.   However, He Song didn’t notice any of this.   He opened the door, entered the room, and locked the door.    Soon, He Song was once again immersed in the Array Tao Introduction in his mind.   Studying the array tao was the most important thing He Song needed to do at the moment.   Once he entered the array tao, successfully set up the Spirit-Gathering Array, his cultivation speed would increase once more.   At that point,   even if he didn’t help others set up the arrays for high rewards, He Song could still quietly make a fortune and quickly grow his cultivation base.   It’s hard to enter the array tao.   Nevertheless, once it is entered, there is a lot to gain.   Take the Spirit-Gathering Array as an example.   To help others set up a Spirit-Gathering Array, the general reward is three hundred spirit stones.   A single Spirit-Gathering Array, three hundred spirit stones!   That’s equivalent to He Song’s current two-year income!   Setting up one Spirit-Gathering Array takes little time, but the income it generates is quite terrifying.   There are many reasons for this.   First, very few Array Path Masters can set up Array Skills; it’s almost impossible to encounter one in ordinary circumstances.   Second, once a Spirit-Gathering Array or any other array is laid out, it almost exists forever. With a mere addition of spirit stones to activate it, it remains effective.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com   Third, once an Array Path Master sets up an array for someone, they’re more likely to be targeted for robbery. Therefore, Array Path Masters usually don’t risk setting up arrays for others. If they were attacked, they probably couldn’t even escape.   While studying the Array Tao Introduction, He Song had already made up his mind not to help others set up arrays.   Although the income from helping others set up arrays is extremely high,   However, the risk involved is by no means small.   As an everlasting being, He Song seeks safety and stability, not risking his life for temporary gains.   That is a path to death.   Not He Song’s path.   Therefore, He Song already had a plan on how to earn spirit stones through the Array Tao before purchasing the Array Tao Introduction.   As long as he uses that method.   Even if he doesn’t set up arrays for others, he can still make a fortune in spirit stones.   An idea crossed his mind, and He Song’s comprehension of Array Tao Introduction became even more enthusiastic.   …   In the following days.   He Song led a repetitive life day after day.   Every morning after his cultivation ended, he went to the spirit field and used the Spirit Rain Skill for half an hour.   After finishing the Spirit Rain Skill, if he had any tasks, he would complete them.    If there were no tasks, he would return home to recover his spirit power.   When his spirit power was fully restored, he would start comprehending the Array Tao Introduction.   If his mental energy was exhausted, he would cultivate for a while, and then continue comprehending.   Thus,   Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.   Time flies.   In a flash, half a month went by.   On this day,   While He Song was at home pondering the Array Tao Introduction, he heard a knock on the door.action   Thud, thud, thud.   Before He Song could open the door, Lin Cong’s excited voice came from outside.   “Mr. He, I have successfully broken through to the Qi-refining mid stage. Today, I’ll host a celebration at Osmanthus Pavilion, and we won’t leave until we are drunk!”   Hearing Lin Cong’s familiar voice, He Song’s face lit up with joy.   A month ago, Lin Cong had told him that he was going into seclusive cultivation to break through to the Qi-refining mid stage.   After so much time had passed, He Song thought that Lin Cong had failed.   Unexpectedly, today, Lin Cong had successfully broken through and came to share the good news with him right away.   This surprise brought both shock and happiness to He Song.   He was shocked that it took Lin Cong a whole month to break through.   He was happy that Lin Cong had indeed successfully advanced to the Qi-refining mid stage.   With this, he had another good friend at the Qi-refining mid stage, and his roots within Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion grew deeper.   At the same time, Lin Cong’s breakthrough would give He Song a deeper understanding of the bottleneck between the Qi Refining Early Stage and Qi-refining mid stage.   Opening the door,   He Song invited Lin Cong into the house.   As they sat down at the table, He Song raised his hands to congratulate Lin Cong.   “Congratulations, my friend, for your great cultivation progress. Foundation Establishment is surely in your future.” He Song bowed his hands to Lin Cong and then handed him a cup of hot tea.   Sitting at the table, Lin Cong’s face beamed even more upon hearing He Song’s congratulations.   Over the many years they had known each other,   He Song had always kept a low profile, seemingly detached from the outside world.   Even becoming friends with his neighbor took several years, but eventually, they were close enough to drink tea and chat together on a daily basis.   Now hearing He Song’s congratulations, Lin Cong felt quite proud.   He was now a Qi-refining mid-stage cultivator!   In Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, although there were many cultivators at this level, their status was still higher than those at the Qi Refining Early Stage.   A flash of ambition crossed Lin Cong’s mind, causing his smile to grow even broader.   “It’s just luck, just luck. Mr. He, do you have time now? Let’s go to the Osmanthus Pavilion and drink until we’re drunk!”

26 Chapter 26: The Struggle of Loose Cultivators Translator: 549690339 He, who made a living by cooperating with others to hunt demonic beasts, still had some savings.   His successful breakthrough this time filled his heart with unspeakable joy.   Thus, even if it meant treating his friend to a feast at the Osmanthus Pavilion, he didn’t mind at all.   Osmanthus Pavilion.   It was the most expensive restaurant in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, without a doubt.   The dishes in Osmanthus Pavilion.   Used spirit rice for the rice, spiritual materials for the vegetables, and demonic beast meat for the meat.   Moreover, they were meticulously selected, and only the best parts were used for cooking.   Most importantly, after having a meal here, the spirit power absorbed from the dishes could be worth several days of hard cultivation.   You can increase your cultivation just by eating.   As a result, the consumption at the Osmanthus Pavilion was extremely high.   Just having a meal for two people alone would cost at least several spirit stones!   And this was the cost for just two people, ordering dishes that were not particularly rare.   If there were more people and the dishes were of a higher quality, it could possibly even cost tens to hundreds of spirit stones.   Such terrifying consumption made the Osmanthus Pavilion’s status in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion unparalleled.   Ordinary loose cultivators would not usually go there unless it was a special occasion.   Those who could casually eat and drink at the Osmanthus Pavilion were mostly noble family members or sect disciples.   The difference between them and loose cultivators was as vast as a chasm.   “Then we shall drink till we’re drunk.” Facing Lin Cong’s invitation, He Song didn’t have any intention of refusing and agreed directly.   Lin Cong’s decision to invite him to the Osmanthus Pavilion was his own choice.   It wasn’t because He Song had forced him to go for a meal there.   If the one treating wanted to go,   He would just go with them.   Rather than pretending to refuse, it was better to be straightforward, otherwise, it would make him look too pretentious and not good.action   As friends, there was no need for pretense.   Seeing He Song agree, Lin Cong nodded satisfactorily, immediately put down the teacup, and dragged He Song out with him.   At this moment, it was lunchtime.    Soon.   They crossed the bustling street,   and arrived at the famous Osmanthus Pavilion in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   As soon as they entered, a waiter dressed as a “little two” came up to them, and at the same time, his voice rang out.   “Welcome, Immortal Masters. Would you like to be on the first or second floor?”   “The second floor, the view is better.” Lin Cong casually replied.   “Alright, please take a seat.”   Osmanthus Pavilion’s second floor.   He Song and Lin Cong sat at a table near a window,   which was so well positioned that they barely had to twist their heads to see the street outside. The view was excellent.   If they looked far away, they could even see the towering mountains in the distance.   Streaks of mist adorned the mountains,   making them appear even more lofty and towering.   The little two had already left, and Lin Cong had placed their order.   At this moment, the two were chatting idly.   “Mr. He, do you know why it took me so long to break through this time?” While waiting for the food, Lin Cong lowered his head and asked in a slightly depressed tone.   “I don’t know. Was it hard to break through the bottleneck?” He Song thought for a moment and hazarded a guess.   “That’s not it. I’ve always heard other loose cultivators say that it’s hard for loose cultivators, but I didn’t really care until now, after experiencing it myself.” Lin Cong shook his head, his words trailing off before he sighed.   But then he continued.   “During the month of my breakthrough, I spent over half of it preparing to break through the bottleneck. But who would have thought that when I finally got everything ready and began my breakthrough, I’d realize that my four spirits root made it actually quite easy.”   As he spoke, Lin Cong gave a bitter smile, his feelings hard to express in words.   In order to break through to the Qi-refining mid-stage, he had made a lot of preparations and heard various things about what would be needed to break through.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels   But when he finally bought everything one by one and started his breakthrough, he suddenly found that these things were absolutely useless to someone with his four spirits root.   With his four spirits root qualification, breaking through the bottleneck from early-stage Qi refining to mid-stage Qi refining was actually quite easy.   Fortunately, he did succeed.   It was just that he had wasted the spirit stones spent on buying those items.   Although the things he bought turned out to be useless,   his own cultivation had indeed successfully reached the Qi-refining mid-stage.   Hence, he was able to casually recount these events to He Song as if they were jokes.   If he had failed the breakthrough, things might have turned out differently.    Moreover, after experiencing it all, Lin Cong truly understood the hardships of loose cultivators.   Loose cultivators.   Most of the time, their information channels relied on hearsay, but who could guarantee the accuracy of what they heard?   Take his own experience as an example.   If he hadn’t gone through it personally, he wouldn’t have believed it either.   Loose cultivators faced many issues during their cultivation journeys, such as how to break through bottlenecks, how to practice cultivation skills, how to learn skills, and how to choose artifacts.   Almost all loose cultivators had to figure these things out for themselves.   In comparison to sect disciples and noble family members, it is extremely difficult for loose cultivators to keep progressing in their cultivation journey.   This was the drawback of having little knowledge and no guidance from elders.   “It’s not difficult for someone with a four spirits root to break through to the Qi-refining mid-stage?” He Song marveled, then his eyes lit up.   He himself also had a four spirits root!   According to Lin Cong’s words, when he reached the fourth stage of Qi refining, breaking through the bottleneck should not be too difficult as well.   At this thought, He Song’s eyes sparkled with gratitude when looking at Lin Cong.   He had initially thought that when Lin Cong successfully broke through to the Qi-refining mid-stage, it would somehow benefit his own future breakthrough to the Qi-refining mid-stage.   But he never expected   that Lin Cong—who had experienced the breakthrough himself—would bring him such news.   This meant that when it was time for his own breakthrough to the Qi-refining mid-stage, he wouldn’t have to take the same detours as Lin Cong.   In the Cultivation World,   everyone knows how important wealth, partners, skills, and land are.   Wealth refers to cultivation resources.   For partners, it’s Daoist partners or knowledgeable friends with whom you can discuss your path.   Skills are cultivation skills, spells, and other practices in the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   As for land, it’s the place with abundant spirit Qi.   He Song had always thought that wealth, partners, skills, and land were important, yet it was only after hearing Lin Cong’s words did he truly understand just how crucial they were.   If he didn’t know Lin Cong, he wouldn’t have received this information.   If he didn’t know this, when breaking through to the Qi-refining mid-stage, he might have had to make the same mistakes Lin Cong had made.   If Lin Cong didn’t have such a good relationship with him and didn’t tell him the truth, he still wouldn’t have known about these things.   In this regard, He Song felt he owed Lin Cong a favor.   Being able to tell him all this showed that Lin Cong was indeed a good friend!   “Thank you for sharing this with me. When I break through to the Qi-refining mid-stage in the future, I will definitely invite you here to catch up!”   He Song didn’t hesitate to make a promise in the face of such kindness.   Spending some spirit stones was nothing.   It was showing his gratitude to Lin Cong that mattered to He Song at that moment.

27 Chapter 27: Recruiting Loose Cultivators? Translator: 549690339 The other person regarded him as a friend, even willing to confide the secret of breaking through cultivation realms to him.   If he were to still haggle over those few spirit stones, that would truly be inappropriate.   He Song thought to himself, his gaze towards Lin Cong also carrying a hint of sentiment.   Years of companionship.   Under Lin Cong’s intent to befriend him, the two had finally become friends.   Now, Lin Cong was able to share the secret of his breakthrough to the Qi-refining mid stage, which symbolized that at least at this moment, Lin Cong had no ill intent towards him.action   He believed that as long as he continued to maintain his relationship with Lin Cong, and also treated Lin Cong with sincerity, Lin Cong would naturally not mistreat him.   As thoughts flashed in his mind, an idea formed all of a sudden – a ‘you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours’ plan.   “That’s right, have you ever been to the Spirit Skill Pavilion, Mrs. Lin?” recalling the days when he had just entered the Cultivation World, and had spent days reading miscellaneous books in the Spirit Skill Pavilion, He Song asked outright.   In the Spirit Skill Pavilion within the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, in addition to cultivating skills and spells being sold, there was a large number of miscellaneous books available for browsing.   These miscellaneous books encompassed everything from the basics of the Cultivation World, some introductions to the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, to the power scopes of various major sects in the Cultivation World. They covered everything.   However, if Loose cultivators wanted to view them, they needed to spend one spirit stone per day.   As for He Song, he was an internal individual from the Immortal Pavilion, so he didn’t have to spend spirit stones to read the books.   He really saved a few spirit stones.   These miscellaneous books, though inferior to the collections in sectarian families and the instructions from seniors, were nonetheless precious to Loose cultivators.   If Lin Cong had never visited, He Song would recommend him to go once. In that way, Lin Cong would gain some insight into ordinary knowledge about cultivating immortality.   At least… it could also prevent him from being easily deceived in the future.   Reflecting on how Lin Cong had been buying so-called breakthrough assistance items from everywhere for his Qi-refining mid stage breakthrough, He Song couldn’t help but find humor in the situation.   If it was him about to break through the stage, he would certainly seek advice from his friends first before purchasing such items.   Meng Guan, Wei Fan – these two figures in Qi-refining mid-stage and even Qi-refining late-stage, are quite familiar with the bottleneck from Qi Refining Early Stage to Qi-refining mid-stage.   There was Lin Cong here also teaching the process firsthand, so when He Song would break through to the Qi-refining mid-stage, he would certainly not repeat the same mistakes again.   “Spirit Skill Pavilion? I have bought some spells there before, but it was so expensive that I rarely go there afterward. For learning spells, I usually buy them from the Stall Section where they are much cheaper,” Lin Cong said thoughtfully.   But then it seemed as if he remembered something, a smile appeared on his face, and he went on.   “Do you want to buy spells from the Spirit Skill Pavilion, Mr. He? I would advise you to buy them from the Stall Section instead, the spells there are much cheaper than at the Spirit Skill Pavilion.”            Faced with Lin Cong’s advice, He Song looked calm on the surface, but he was feeling somewhat helpless inside.   As expected.   Loose cultivators were just that, always considering the price above all else.   Of course, if He Song were a Loose cultivator himself, he would do the same.   However, He Song is not a Loose cultivator in the true sense. He’s a monk from the Immortal Pavilion, and also a transmigrator from the Information Big Bang Era, who knows the importance of knowledge.   Thus, although he was not as privileged as the disciples of clans and noble families, he was far better off than real Loose cultivators.   Like everything else, knowledge also came at a cost in the Cultivation World.   Cultivation skills required spirit stones.   Spells required spirit stones.   The Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth also required spirit stones.   Even the miscellaneous books in the Spirit Skill Pavilion required spirit stones.   According to Lin Cong’s current mindset, He Song felt that even if he told him about the miscellaneous books in the Spirit Skill Pavilion and that understanding various common sense about the Cultivation World would only cost one spirit stone a day, Lin Cong would probably reject the offer due to the cost.   After thinking it over, He Song just shook his head.   Whether to say it or not was his prerogative.   Whether to go or not would be up to Lin Cong.   In some matters, he only had to do his part, and would be at peace with it.   Whether it could be of help to Lin Cong depended on his own fate.   After all, he wasn’t a nanny, he couldn’t force-feed him.   “No, but in the Spirit Skill Pavilion, there are various kinds of miscellaneous books. You can quickly become familiar with the Cultivation World by browsing them. If you have time, you might want to take a look. It only costs one spirit stone a day, and within a few days, you should be able to finish reading them all and have a basic understanding of the Cultivation World.”   He spoke truthfully, but He Song didn’t hold much hope that Lin Cong would actually go.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m   However, since the words had already been spoken, He Song didn’t have any intention of retracting them.   He just had to tell the truth.   As for what happened next, who could say?   With these thoughts, He Song’s gaze swept around, just in time to see the waiter carrying dishes over.   “Thank you for the advice, friend. Let’s not talk about sobering up today, we can talk about visiting the Spirit Skill Pavilion tomorrow!” Lin Cong also saw the waiter, so he immediately put other things aside, looking forward to the delicious food.   Seeing this, He Song didn’t say anything more, he put down his teacup and waited for the dishes to be served.            Soon enough.   A table full of exquisite dishes were laid out before both He Song and Lin Cong.   The faint aura of spirit power spread from the dishes, making anyone who took a light whiff feel a pleasant sensation of spirit power entering their bodies.   The spirit power contained in the extremely exquisite dishes was not to be underestimated.   At the same time, two bowls of spirit rice were also brought onto the table.   Spirit materials, spirit rice, demonic beast meat.   All these combined to form the expensive spiritual cuisine before their eyes.   In the Cultivation World.   Anything lacking spirit power is worthless.   But if it contains spirit power, even if it’s just an ordinary stone, that would also be a spirit stone!   As the meal was served, He Song and Lin Cong quickly started to enjoy it.   However, as they chatted casually while eating, they also heard some rumors from other tables.   The Red Spirit Gold Mine not far from the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Had started recruiting Loose cultivators ten days ago.   Nowadays.   The posters recruiting Loose cultivators to dig for the Red Spirit Gold Mine were plastered all over the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Aside from the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, similar notices were also posted in several other nearby Immortal Pavilions.   Under the temptation of a high salary of thirty spirit stones a month, Loose cultivators from several Immortal Pavilions flocked to the location of the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   However, not everyone was accepted to work in the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   Cultivators needed to have at least reached the third-tier of Qi Refining.   Cultivators at the first-tier and second-tier of Qi Refining, due to being too weak, were completely excluded.   Only those who reached the third tier of Qi Refining were eligible to enter the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   Of course, the higher the cultivation realm, the better.   Whether it’s the third-tier of Qi Refining.   Qi-refining mid-stage.   Or Qi-refining late-stage.   As long as the criteria was met, all could enter.   Moreover, there were said to be several Foundation Establishment cultivators guarding the Red Spirit Gold Mine, making its defense impregnable.   Such a strong lineup, coupled with a payoff of thirty spirit stones a month, attracted countless Loose cultivators.

28 Chapter 28: Recruiting Cannon Fodders Translator: 549690339 For a time, loose cultivators from several surrounding Immortal Pavilions set out on the path to the Chi Ling Gold Mine.   Thirty spirit stones a month.   That’s three hundred and sixty spirit stones a year.   This income is much higher than that of the inner cultivators of the average Immortal Pavilion.   Compared to spiritual plant farmer He Song, who only has an annual income of one hundred and fifty spirit stones, the income has more than doubled.   Most ordinary loose cultivators live a dangerous life, always at the edge of death.action   Now that there’s a mining job that is not dangerous and has high income, of course they won’t let it pass.   As a result, there were far fewer loose cultivators coming and going in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   The once lively Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion seemed a little empty these days.   “Mr. He, do you know the news about the Red Spirit Gold Mine?” Being at the same table with He Song, Lin Cong naturally heard the news that He Song had heard.   For a moment, Lin Cong’s eyes became somewhat fiery, as if he had developed a great interest in mining.   In his opinion,   Mining must be safer than hunting demonic beasts in the outside world.   And the income from mining is not lower than risking one’s life to hunt demonic beasts.   With this calculation, if possible, he would like to give it a try.   To earn spirit stones safely and securely.   Who would want to live a life of licking blood from the blade?   “Red Spirit Gold Mine…” An image of Meng Guan flashed through He Song’s mind.   He didn’t know how Meng Guan was doing in the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   Speaking of which,   It had been half a month since Meng Guan left the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to mine at the Red Spirit Gold Mine, right? There has been no news since then, which caused He Song to worry a little.   However, facing Lin Cong’s inquiry at this moment, He Song thought of what Lin Cong had just said to him.   After thinking about it in his heart, he quickly made up his mind.   Well, he might as well try to persuade his friend once again, so as to prevent him from rushing to the mine area without any hesitation.   “Mrs. Lin, keep this between you and me, don’t spread it around.” He Song whispered to Lin Cong first.    Then, under the watchful gaze of Lin Cong’s suddenly bright eyes, He Song casually took out a piece of paper from his sleeve.   This paper was originally used for making paper cranes for the Sound Transmission Skill.   But there are so many people here, and it’s easy for the conversation to be overheard.   So He Song had to resort to this.   Spirit power flowed between his fingers.   Wisps of spirit power seeped out, quickly carving a line of text on the paper.   “The Red Spirit Gold Mine recruits only loose cultivators, not internally affiliated cultivators of the Immortal Pavilion.”   After finishing writing the text, He Song handed the paper to Lin Cong and continued to enjoy his food.   However, after handing the paper to Lin Cong, a stone in He Song’s heart fell to the ground.   Lin Cong’s secret of breaking through from the Qi Refining Early Stage to the Qi Refining Mid Stage was a favor He Song owed him at first.   He originally wanted to exchange that information with knowledge about the Cultivation World from the books in the Spirit Skill Pavilion, but unfortunately, Lin Cong didn’t seem to take it in.   He was still worried that he wouldn’t be able to pay back this favor.   Now it’s all good.   This piece of paper is enough for He Song to return that favor.   At this moment, even if Lin Cong doesn’t go to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to read those miscellaneous books later, He Song already feels he has repaid the favor.   “This…” At the side, Lin Cong, who had just taken the paper, widened his eyes.   However, no matter how shocked he was in his heart, after reading the text, Lin Cong’s hand immediately flashed with a wave of spirit power.   By the time the wave of spirit power had dissipated, the paper in Lin Cong’s hand had long turned to dust, swiftly dispersing with the wind.   The paper disappeared.   As if it had never been there in the first place.   But at this moment, Lin Cong’s heart was filled with shock and turmoil.   With just a quick glance, he knew what shocking news He Song had recorded on the paper he handed him.   Under what circumstances would mining only recruit loose cultivators?   Under what circumstances would loose cultivators be recruited to mine?   Under what circumstances would a small-scale vein be guarded by several Foundation Establishment cultivators?   He didn’t know any of this.   But he did know one thing.   The more secure the place, the more likely there is some kind of treasure hidden inside, and at the same time, the greater the danger it conceals.    Suddenly realizing this, Lin Cong broke out in a cold sweat.   Before, he had thought that if he could, he would mine instead of hunting demonic beasts in the outside world as it’s more comfortable.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com   But now, he understood.   Such a high reward was recruiting not ordinary miners, but cannon fodder!   Perhaps, in the Red Spirit Gold Mine, there were unknown dangers waiting for these cannon fodder.   Under the suppression of several Foundation Establishment cultivators,   Even if the cannon fodder were to rebel collectively, they probably wouldn’t be able to create any disturbance.   As for what was hidden inside, that was not something he could know.   But while breaking out in a cold sweat, the look Lin Cong gave He Song was filled with thick gratitude at this moment.   “Thank you for saving my life, friend!” Bowing deeply to He Song, Lin Cong felt that his intention to befriend He Song before was the most correct thing he had ever done in his life!   If it weren’t for him intentionally befriending He Song five years ago,   He might be rushing to the Red Spirit Gold Mine by now.   And when that time comes, his fate…   Thinking of this, Lin Cong couldn’t help but feel even more grateful to He Song and felt extremely excited about being He Song’s good friend.   Befriending He Song could really save one’s life!   He Song did not know what Lin Cong was thinking.   But it was not unexpected that the slip of paper he handed over would change Lin Cong’s expression so drastically.   This was information from Wei Fan, a Qi Refining Late Stage cultivator, half a month ago.   Although the news about the Red Spirit Gold Mine has now spread throughout the entire Immortal Pavilion, there are very few people like He Song who know the secrets.   As such, to deter a loose cultivator like Lin Cong, there was no problem at all.   The channels for loose cultivators to obtain information are far too scarce.   “As long as you don’t spread it, friend, this matter is secret. If someone traces it back…”, He Song was naturally confident about Lin Cong’s character after five years, but he still needed to give a warning.   Although this matter is not forbidden to be spread,   Wei Fan casually told He Song and Meng Guan.   But even if it spreads to the loose cultivators, not many of them would believe it.   On the contrary, they might even think that it is a lie made up to prevent them from earning spirit stones.   However, He Song deliberately made this matter sound more serious, just to block Lin Cong from asking further questions.   After all, He Song only knew this much.   If the questioning continues, it would be awkward for him.   “Mr. He, you worry too much. My mouth is tight, come on, let’s drink and not go home until we’re drunk!” Faced with He Song’s warning, Lin Cong was awakened and felt a trace of lingering fear.   As a loose cultivator, he didn’t know He Song’s thoughts at the moment. Instead, he felt even more goodwill towards He Song for reminding him specially.

29 Chapter 29: Meng Guan’s Letter Translator: 549690339 In the time that followed, the two gradually drank and exchanged their cups, putting everything behind them and focusing solely on enjoying their food and drink.   This time, Lin Cong had successfully broken through to the Qi-refining mid stage and was warned by He Song to avoid a life-threatening crisis. Therefore, he was in an excellent mood and did not hesitate to spend spirit stones while drinking.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m   And precisely because of this.   After drinking cup after cup of spirit alcohol, he soon passed out completely drunk.   On the other hand, He Song did not drink much.   Although inside the Immortal Pavilion, He Song was always vigilant in his heart.   At the time when his own cultivation was at the lowest level in the Cultivation World, He Song did not want to make mistakes by getting drunk.   This time, he was only slightly tipsy, nowhere near drunk.   Fortunately, Lin Cong had already settled the bill beforehand. Seeing him unconscious, He Song naturally helped him back home.   He took Lin Cong back to his own home.   Then He Song went back to his own house.   As neighbors, He Song managed to save some time.   …   Time goes by.   Years pass.   Half a month later, in the morning, He Song received a sound-transmitting paper crane.   The writing on the paper crane was from Meng Guan.   “Mr. He, I have been in the Red Spirit Gold Mine for a month, and today I got my hands on thirty-five spirit stones. I should be celebrating, but unfortunately, there are restrictions on entering and exiting the Red Spirit Gold Mine, so I can’t leave. I can only deliver the good news to my friend through the Sound Transmission Skill.”   “Thanks to Wei’s fortune, there were not many people when Meng arrived at the mine. The mine manager learned that I was a cultivator from the Immortal Pavilion and let me command a team of loose cultivators to supervise their mining. As a result, my monthly salary has increased by five spirit stones.”   “Counting the days, today is usually the time when the three of us gather, but unfortunately, I cannot come back. I hope my friend won’t blame me.”   “When I can leave, I will apologize in person and drink three cups as a punishment.”   “Meng Guan.”   After scanning the lines of text on the paper, He Song was silent for a long time.   Eventually, he carefully folded the paper and stored it securely in his quiet room.   He left his house.    He Song walked towards the spirit field he managed while exhaling a sigh of relief.   “Leading a team of loose cultivators means that Meng Guan is not at the lowest level in the Red Spirit Gold Mine. At the very least, he’s a small manager.”   “In this way, his safety increases, and the chances of him dying in the mine become smaller.”   Thinking this way in his heart, He Song no longer lamented Meng Guan’s journey to the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   People have their own destiny.   Just like Meng Guan.   Originally, he only wanted to mine for spirit stones.   But unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the mine, he was promoted to a small commander.   In this way, the danger in the mine, which was originally full of malice towards miners, was directly avoided by him.   There might be other dangers in the mine, but as a small commander, he would naturally have more chances to save his life than ordinary miners.   Moreover, Meng Guan’s cultivation was at the sixth-tier Qi Refining, and he had all kinds of spirit amulets and magical treasures. This greatly increased his survival rate.   In this case, Meng Guan’s trip to the Red Spirit Gold Mine could not be considered a life-or-death situation anymore.   It was indeed dangerous.   But his chances of survival had also increased a lot.   With various thoughts flashing through his mind, He Song quickly arrived at the spirit field and started casting the Spirit Rain Skill.   After half an hour, the Spirit Rain Skill was finished.   He Song turned and immediately went to the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Today was the time for their monthly gathering.   Although Meng Guan was no longer there, turning the original gathering of three people into a gathering of two, He Song still wanted to carry on the tradition that had lasted for several years.   Spirit Construction Pavilion.   When He Song arrived, he found that Wei Fan had been waiting for a long time.   At this moment, Wei Fan was holding a piece of paper in his hands, his eyes on the paper, his expression uncertain whether he was happy or worried.   “Wei, did you also receive a Sound Transmission Skill message from Lao Meng?” He Song casually asked as he sat down next to Wei Fan.   Meng Guan could send a Sound Transmission Skill to him.   Of course, he would not forget about Wei Fan.   Asking this question, He Song was knowingly playing dumb.   “Hmm, Lao Meng said I helped him a lot, and when he comes back, he wants to invite me to drink in the red light district.” Upon hearing this, Wei Fan put down the paper in his hand and spoke with a hint of a smile on his face.    In the small circle of three friends.   Meng Guan seemed to be old, but he had a more unrestrained character. He was the one who joked the most. Hearing Wei Fan say this, He Song was not surprised.   However, thinking that Meng Guan still had the mood to joke, it meant that his situation was still good.   He Song felt more at ease in his heart.   As for the matter of drinking at the red light district, it was just a joke and should not be taken seriously.   But if Meng Guan really came back, he would indeed want to thank Wei Fan a lot.   “Come on, as long as he can return safely. But have you heard any other news related to the Red Spirit Gold Mine recently?” Shaking his head, He Song didn’t pay too much attention to this matter, instead asking about news from the mining area.   Wei Fan, with a cultivation in the Qi-refining late stage, could get much more information in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion than He Song.   A Qi-refining late-stage cultivator was among the top tier of the pyramid in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Above them, there were only a few cultivators stuck at the ninth-tier Qi Refining and that single Foundation Establishment Stage Master.   “No news, but I always feel that this vein is not as simple as we originally thought.” Wei Fan, with a thoughtful expression on his face, took a sip from his teacup.   “Normally, a vein with only tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of spirit stones should not require several Foundation Establishment Stage Masters to guard it.”   “It might contain some hidden information we don’t know. I’ll pay more attention to it lately. If something really happens, I’ll inform you as soon as possible.” In the end, Wei Fan didn’t forget to give He Song a reassurance.   His intuition told him that there must be something fishy about where the vein was located.   But without specific information, he didn’t dare to confirm anything.   However, if something did happen, he would definitely inform He Song as soon as possible.   As for whether something would happen or not.   He wasn’t sure.   On the side, He Song glanced at Wei Fan and asked,action   “Several Foundation Establishment Stage Masters guarding the mine?”   These words flashed through his mind, and He Song’s heart immediately became alert.   He had also heard such news before.   It was said that in the vein where the Red Spirit Gold Mine was located, there were several Foundation Establishment Stage Masters guarding it.   But at first, he didn’t care about it, thinking it was fake news.   Foundation Establishment Stage Masters were not cabbage that could be deployed everywhere.   Even though the Thick Earth Sect was a Golden Elixir Great Sect, there weren’t many Foundation Establishment Stage Masters in the sect, so they couldn’t be sent out randomly.   However, when Wei Fan confirmed the news, He Song’s heart instantly sounded the alarm.   Thinking of how close the Red Spirit Gold Mine was to him, He Song felt shivers down his spine, his whole body cold, and his hair standing on end.   If something really happened in the mining area of the Red Spirit Gold Mine, his Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion might soon be affected.   At that time…

30 Chapter 30: Moving? Translator: 549690339 “Wei, is the Foundation Establishment Stage Master still in the Immortal Pavilion?” He Song suddenly had the intention to leave this place, but after some thought, he finally asked another question.   If the guardian of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was still here, he might not need to run away.   However, if the guardian of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion had also gone to the Red Spirit Gold Mine, He Song felt that he might have to run away immediately.   Otherwise, if anything happened, without a Foundation Establishment Stage Master to maintain order in the Immortal Pavilion, chaos would likely ensue.   In such chaos, as a Qi Refining Early Stage cultivator, he would probably be left to the whims of fate.   This was not a situation He Song wanted to experience.   He just wanted to cultivate in peace.   He didn’t want to get involved in any life-threatening battles.   “Of course, the Master is still here. I saw him from afar just yesterday. What’s the reason for asking?” Wei Fan replied with curiosity.   “The Red Spirit Gold Mine is right next to the Immortal Pavilion. I worry that if chaos arises there and there’s no Foundation Establishment Stage Master guarding the Pavilion, Evil Cultivators may run rampant,” He Song replied, his expression slightly relaxed.   As long as they were still here, that was good.   As long as they were still here, that was good.   He Song let out a big sigh of relief in his heart.   As long as the Foundation Establishment Stage Master was in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, no unrest could arise.   Even if Evil Cultivators attacked, they wouldn’t stand a chance against a Foundation Establishment Stage Master. They would be as useless as eggs thrown against a rock.   However, even after learning that the Immortal Pavilion still had a Foundation Establishment Stage Master stationed there, He Song had already begun to consider whether or not he needed to leave the Pavilion to avoid disaster.   The location of the Red Spirit Gold Mine seemed like a ticking time bomb to He Song.   Life would be manageable if nothing happened, but if anything did happen… the surrounding Immortal Pavilions would likely face some trouble.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was not far from the location of the Red Spirit Gold Mine and could be affected quickly.action   Continuing to live here with his Qi Refining Early Stage cultivation had some unknown risks.    “My friend, you don’t have to worry. Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion is under the jurisdiction of the Thick Earth Sect, a powerful Golden Elixir Great Faction. There won’t be any lowly villains daring to create trouble here. Your cautious nature hasn’t changed at all,” Wei Fan reassured him with a smile.   However, as if remembering something, Wei Fan’s expression stiffened for a moment, before he quickly spoke again.   “If you don’t mind, you can move in with me, and we can take care of each other. Even if chaos arises in the Pavilion, I can ensure your safety,” he said.   During the five years of friendship between He Song and Wei Fan, Wei Fan had come to know He Song’s cautious nature well.   At one of their monthly gatherings, He Song had advised Wei Fan on a matter due to his cautious nature, helping Wei Fan to avoid a crisis of moderate severity.   For this reason, Wei Fan did not hold any grudges against He Song’s caution and even began to agree with it after growing suspicious about the anomalies at the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   This was also the reason he had invited He Song to live with him.   It was because of their friendship, and also because caution could indeed lead to a longer life.   Having a naturally cautious friend by one’s side could sometimes prove very useful when something unexpected happened.   Once Wei Fan finished speaking, He Song’s train of thought was instantly interrupted.   He had initially been thinking about how to leave the Immortal Pavilion, how to survive in the mortal world as a third-tier Qi Refiner, how to avoid disaster without drawing attention, and so on.   But he hadn’t expected that Wei Fan would come up with a solution he had never considered.   Moving out?   Not moving out of the Immortal Pavilion.   But moving in with Wei Fan and living together with him?   This…   After considering the idea seriously, He Song suddenly saw the light.   Even if chaos were to erupt at the Red Spirit Gold Mine, the area was still under the jurisdiction of the Golden Core Sect, the Thick Earth Sect, which was guarded by several Foundation Establishment cultivators.   If anything happened, the battle would most likely take place near the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   He Song had never witnessed a Foundation Establishment Stage battle, but he figured the turmoil was unlikely to affect the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   After all, although the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was not far from where the Red Spirit Gold Mine was located, it was still several hundred miles away.   A battle involving Foundation Establishment cultivators would not cover such a vast distance.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m   Additionally, the Thick Earth Sect had Golden Core experts!    If anything happened at the Red Spirit Gold Mine, the Golden Core cultivator of the Thick Earth Sect would be there as a backup.   In such a case, even if a major battle involving Foundation Establishment cultivators occurred at the Red Spirit Gold Mine, the Foundation Establishment cultivator guarding the Pavilion might only go to reinforce them at most.   He Song had initially been concerned about this.   The safety of the Immortal Pavilion was mainly ensured by the presence of Foundation Establishment cultivators, deterring Evil Cultivators from causing trouble.   However, once the Foundation Establishment cultivator guarding the Immortal Pavilion left to reinforce the disputants at the Red Spirit Gold Mine, the Pavilion’s defenses would be weakened, making them vulnerable to Evil Cultivator attacks.   At that time, as a Qi Refining Early Stage cultivator in the chaotic Immortal Pavilion, he might only be at the mercy of fate.   But when Wei Fan invited him to live together, He Song’s initial concerns immediately vanished.   Wei Fan’s cultivation was at the seventh-tier Qi Refining stage, within the scope of the Qi-refining late stage.   His residence was in an area with the richest spirit Qi and closest to the Foundation Establishment Stage Master within the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   In that area, the surrounding cultivators were mostly at the Qi-refining late stage, with a few friends or family members of lower cultivation levels.   Under such circumstances, with almost all the surrounding cultivators at the Qi-refining late stage, any Evil Cultivators who attacked would likely not dare to cause trouble in that area.   A single Qi-refining late-stage cultivator may not be formidable on their own.   But a group of them was indeed a force to be reckoned with.   When a group of Qi-refining late-stage cultivators joined forces, nobody below the Foundation Establishment stage would dare to provoke them.   “Alright, I’ll take advantage of Wei’s hospitality.” He Song didn’t hesitate, made up his mind after thinking for a while, and responded.   He had established himself in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, and leaving now would be extremely detrimental to his future development.   There was scarce spirit Qi in the mortal world, so his cultivation speed would significantly decrease.   In the mortal world, spirit stones were scarce, and he wouldn’t be able to receive his 150 annual spirit stones as he did now.   Although there were occasional Evil Cultivators in the mortal world, He Song’s low cultivation made him an easy target.   In addition, if he left and wanted to become a spiritual plant farmer again in the future, it wouldn’t be as easy as before.   Even though he had a good relationship with Zhao Lin, the person in charge of recruiting spiritual plant farmers for the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, who knew what would happen to Zhao Lin in the chaos that might occur?   Moving in with Wei Fan, while somewhat inconvenient, was the best option available given the current circumstances.   Firstly, he wouldn’t have to leave the Pavilion, allowing him to maintain his cultivation speed.   Secondly, he wouldn’t have to resign from his position in the Pavilion, ensuring his annual salary of 150 spirit stones.   Thirdly, with Wei Fan, a Qi-refining late stage cultivator, beside him, he wouldn’t have to worry about his safety.   Fourthly…

31 Chapter 31: Artificial Mountains and Waters Translator: 549690339 There was no fourth choice.   With so many benefits placed before them, anyone who came would know how to choose.   Moreover, after spending five years together, Wei Fan had a deep understanding of He Song, and He Song naturally had a similarly deep understanding of Wei Fan.   That was why one could invite while the other could agree.   Wei Fan knew He Song’s situation and was eager to give him a hand.   He Song knew Wei Fan’s character, and living together wouldn’t be a problem.   Such mutual trust could not have been achieved without the five years of being together; even the thought of it would have been impossible.   If another Qi-refining late-stage cultivator had invited He Song, with his cautiousness, he might have thought that the other person was trying to harm him and take his wealth.   Let alone actually agreeing.   It was because of Wei Fan, having been together for so long, that He Song agreed after careful consideration.   “In that case, Mr. He, please go pack your things first. I will wait for you here, and when the time comes, we can go home together.” Seeing He Song agree, Wei Fan’s expression brightened, and he urged without hesitation.   For cultivators like Wei Fan, who had reached the Qi-refining late stage and only needed to slowly accumulate spirit power to cultivate all the way to Qi Refining Perfection, the daily boredom and tedium were the hardest to endure.   Now that He Song had agreed to live with him…   Did that mean that his future life would not be as dull as it is now?   On ordinary days, he could chat and drink tea with friends, talk about everything, and have friends to accompany him when he felt bored.   Wei Fan felt that just thinking about this was much more interesting than his current life.   That was also the reason why Wei Fan openly declared his love for making friends when he first met He Song.   Before breaking through to the Qi-refining late stage, his main focus was on overcoming the bottleneck.   However, after successfully breaking through to the Qi-refining late stage and feeling the boredom and tedium of daily silent cultivation, he became more interested in making friends.   Having very few friends in his day-to-day life, the dullness could even break a person’s spirit.   However.   Just as Wei Fan was urging happily…    He Song suddenly became more alert when he looked at Wei Fan.   This Wei Fan seemed to have shown no interest in women in the five years they’d known each other.   He just agreed to live with him, and Wei Fan got so excited…   Could it be…   After a slight hesitation, He Song finally discarded the terrible thought in his mind.   In the past five years, he, too, hadn’t shown any interest in women. Perhaps he was just overthinking.   With that thought, the alertness in He Song’s eyes quickly faded, and then he went to take his leave.   Leaving Spirit Construction Pavilion,   He Song first returned to his home and packed up all his belongings.   He wanted to say goodbye to Lin Cong, his neighbor, but after thinking about it, he dispelled the idea.   He was just going to Wei Fan’s home to seek refuge. Although his room would be vacated, with Wei Fan, the steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, his room would still be reserved for him.   The rental rooms in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion were not always fully occupied every month.   Keeping a room for someone like He Song was actually a small matter for Wei Fan.   After some time, once the danger was over, He Song would return here to continue living.   Rather than saying goodbye, it’d be better to stay at Wei Fan’s place for a while and then use the Sound Transmission Skill to inform Lin Cong of the situation.action   That way, Lin Cong could also be alert and not be caught off guard if an Evil Cultivator attacked.   Making a decision, He Song pondered for a moment, then quickly decided to give Wei Fan the rent money he’d saved during his time taking refuge.   Wei Fan helped him through this crisis, which was already a huge favor.   If he didn’t pay some rent, He Song would feel bad about it.   Although the rent he was giving wasn’t much, it was a gesture of goodwill, and he couldn’t stay with Wei Fan so comfortably without contributing.   With this in mind,   He Song quickly returned to Spirit Construction Pavilion with his belongings.   Upon seeing He Song come back with his luggage, Wei Fan promptly led him to where he lived.   The living conditions of a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator were far better than those of a Qi-refining early-stage cultivator like He Song.    Wei Fan lived in a small courtyard.   In the courtyard, there were artificial mountains and flowing water, as well as a two-story building.   The building had a master bedroom, two secondary bedrooms, a servant’s room, a total of four rooms for living.   In addition, there was also a living room, two cultivation quiet rooms, a study room, a kitchen, and a training room.   So many rooms made He Song dizzy, and he couldn’t help but think it was extravagant.   Also, the spirit Qi concentration here was much higher than where He Song lived, which meant a faster cultivation speed.   You see,   He Song’s previous room, which cost ten spirit stones a month, only had one bedroom and an attached cultivation quiet room.   Nothing else.   And for that, he had to pay ten spirit stones in rent every month.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com   But now?   Looking at the scale of the rooms and the spirit Qi concentration in Wei Fan’s courtyard, He Song couldn’t imagine how much this small courtyard would cost in monthly rent.   “Wei, how much is the monthly rent here?” He asked when he couldn’t figure it out. Facing his friend, He Song never felt embarrassed.   “The market price is fifty spirit stones a month, five hundred spirit stones a year, but I don’t need spirit stones to live here. After reaching the Qi-refining late stage, the Immortal Pavilion will arrange a free courtyard for any internal cultivators.” Wei Fan answered without much thought, revealing information He Song had not known before.   Such information was just common knowledge to Wei Fan, who was already in the Qi-refining late stage.   But for He Song at this moment, it surprised him a bit.   You see,   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion wasn’t a charity.   This could be seen from his monthly rent of ten spirit stones.   For Qi-refining early-stage cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion, after deducting120 spirit stones as annual rent, they only had 20 or 30 spirit stones to spend freely each year.   To treat the Qi-refining early-stage cultivators like laborers was almost unfair.   However, once a cultivator reached the Qi-refining late stage, they’d be given a free courtyard, which puzzled He Song as he thought about the way this all operated.   It seemed like they didn’t treat the lowest-level Qi-refining early-stage cultivators as humans.   “Don’t be surprised. The rules of the Immortal Pavilion are like this: late-stage Qi-refining cultivators live here all year round, making the Immortal Pavilion safer, so naturally, they need better treatment.”   “But for early-stage Qi-refining cultivators… it’s already good to be able to enter the Immortal Pavilion. At least it’s much safer than the outside world. Within the Immortal Pavilion, they can safely spend the most vulnerable time of a cultivator.”   “Loose cultivators cannot enter the Immortal Pavilion, and the number of them killed every year is countless. Compared to them, it’s already lucky to be able to enter the Immortal Pavilion.”   “Besides, if your cultivation reaches the Qi-refining mid-stage, your treatment within the Immortal Pavilion will also improve. You’ll know when the time comes, so don’t be surprised.”   While showing He Song around the environment, Wei Fan also told him some stories about the internal situation of the Immortal Pavilion.

32 Chapter 32: Secrets of the Immortal Pavilion Translator: 549690339 He Song had not known about these things before.   Although he had known Wei Fan for five years, their previous gatherings were mostly about sharing interesting stories and bonding with each other.   It was the first time that Wei Fan specifically talked about the internal affairs of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion like today.   While following Wei Fan to familiarize with the environment, He Song quickly gained his own understanding of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Belongs to the Golden Elixir Major Faction’s Thick Earth Sect’s Green Wall Immortal City.   There are two sources of personnel within the pavilion.   The first one is the loose cultivators like He Song, who were recruited into the pavilion after being seen by someone and became an internal cultivator of the pavilion.   The second is the ones who come from the Thick Earth Mansion, like Wei Fan and Meng Guan.   The Thick Earth Mansion is a place specially set up by the Thick Earth Sect to screen disciples.   Those who cannot break through to the Qi-refining mid stage within a certain age in the Mansion would be assigned to various Immortal Cities or Immortal Pavilions to take up duties.   If they perform well in the future and improve their cultivation rapidly, those cultivators sent from the Thick Earth Mansion may join the Thick Earth Sect again and become the disciples of the sect.   However, within the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, there is almost no significant difference between these two types.   Next, it’s about the treatment of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   In the Qi Refining Early Stage, most internal cultivators work hard all year and only have 20 to 30 spirit stones at most that they can use freely.   However, due to their low cultivation, they can still quickly improve their own cultivation just by absorbing the spirit Qi within the pavilion.   This was an unwritten rule that existed in almost all Immortal Pavilions.   The purpose, of course, is to screen out cultivators with perseverance, determination, and vision.   If one cannot bear it, they are free to leave at any time.   Loose cultivators can earn more without entering the pavilion and don’t have to pay rent, which naturally makes them wealthier than the Qi Refining Early Stage cultivators within the pavilion.   The threshold of ten spirit stones a month for rent is also specially designed.   The purpose is to drive away cultivators with no talent and let them retreat from difficulties.   At the same time, it attracts talented loose cultivators to contribute to the development of Immortal Pavilions.   In the Qi Refining Early Stage, only by joining an Immortal Pavilion and becoming an internal cultivator can one live in the pavilion without being affected.    Some rely on an annual salary, while others have accommodation directly included.   Even if there are few spirit stones available, being able to live within an Immortal Pavilion is a huge benefit in itself.   As for when one reaches the Qi-refining mid stage,   The resources available to internal cultivators will no longer be as scarce as in the Qi Refining Early Stage.   Cultivators who can cultivate to the Qi-refining mid stage in the Immortal Pavilion can master some techniques for earning spirit stones. Coupled with the annual support they receive from the pavilion, life can be tolerable.   It is at this moment that the cultivators who can endure the boring and tedious cultivation in the Qi Refining Early Stage truly pass the most difficult hurdle in their path to immortality.   Those who lack perseverance, determination, and vision would have been weeded out in the Qi Refining Early Stage, becoming loose cultivators with a high mortality rate.   And this is precisely what the big Immortal Pavilions want to see.   After removing the false and preserving the true, the cultivators who can stay must have their own extraordinary qualities.   As for cultivators in the Qi-refining late stage…   They are the backbone of the Immortal Pavilion, with more resources available to them. As long as they are in the Immortal Pavilion, their presence serves as a great deterrent to evil cultivators.   In addition, Qi-refining late stage cultivators generally strive towards Foundation Establishment and require many resources.   Naturally, the more resources they can obtain, the better.   As Wei Fan narrated, He Song came to understand many things that he had never understood before.   At the same time, he began to have more motivation to improve his cultivation.   Once he reaches the Qi-refining mid stage, or even the late stage, his life will definitely be better than it is now.   Wei Fan took He Song on a tour of the small courtyard, arranging for He Song to stay in one of the second bedrooms and giving him access to one of the quiet rooms. As they settled in, the sky gradually darkened.   “I’m sorry for the hurried return today, so you’ll have to make do with a simple meal for now. Tomorrow, I’ll buy some good wine and food to welcome you properly!” At the dinner table, Wei Fan poured a cup of wine for He Song and apologized.   However, by his side,   He Song looked at the sumptuous dishes in front of him, the fragrant spirit rice in the bowl, and sensed the spirit alcohol in the wine cup. He couldn’t help but feel helpless.   It turned out that cultivators in the Qi-refining late stage must be living much better lives than those in Qi Refining Early Stage like himself.   What Wei Fan referred to as a casual meal was spirit rice with spirit alcohol, and dishes made with spiritual materials and demonic beast meat.   He Song had only eaten such a luxurious meal once before at Osmanthus Pavilion.   At that time, it was Lin Cong who had broken through to the Qi-refining mid-stage and invited him to the meal.   Truth be told,Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m   He Song could only occasionally afford to eat spirit rice. As for spirit alcohol and spiritual materials with demonic beast meat, it was beyond the budget of a small cultivator like him in the Qi Refining Early Stage.    However, having learned about the treatment of cultivators at the Qi-refining mid-stage or even the late stage, He Song didn’t feel much envy in his heart.   As his cultivation improved, he would eventually have access to all these things.   That’s the beauty of cultivating immortality.action   As long as one’s cultivation level rises, their strength, status, identity, and power will all be significantly improved.   Everything is possible as long as one’s cultivation reaches a certain level.   That’s why He Song could maintain a calm attitude.   As long as he lived long enough, his cultivation would eventually improve.   When it comes to having a long life,   He Song wasn’t afraid of anyone.   “Come on, let’s drink!” Ignoring Wei Fan’s apologies, He Song picked up his wine glass and clinked it with the other.   With a ding, the two wine glasses touched.   Soon, the small courtyard was filled with laughter and cheerful conversation.   …   He Song settled down at Wei Fan’s small courtyard.   He no longer went to the spirit field every morning as he used to.   Unless the crisis of the Red Spirit Gold Mine erupted, He Song didn’t even want to step out of Immortal Pavilion.   His cautious nature was at work in his mind.   At the same time, he worried that evil cultivators might take advantage of the situation, so he resorted to such measures.   However, as a spiritual plant farmer of the Immortal Pavilion, there would be penalties if one didn’t complete the cultivation of the spirit field.   If the harvest of the five-acre spirit field didn’t meet the standard, the missing spirit rice would have to be borne by the spiritual plant farmer.   As a last resort, He Song asked a familiar spiritual plant farmer to look after his spirit field for twenty spirit stones.   Being able to earn an extra twenty spirit stones,   The spiritual plant farmer who was familiar with He Song was naturally delighted.   His job was just to extend the duration of the Spirit Rain Skill he previously cast, from half an hour to a full hour.   The unexpected income of twenty more spirit stones was a pleasant surprise.   In this way, He Song, with one less worry, began to immerse himself in diligent cultivation in Wei Fan’s small courtyard.   The spirit Qi in Wei Fan’s small courtyard was much richer than where He Song had lived before.   This made He Song’s cultivation speed faster, and the spirit power in his body began to grow more rapidly.   Meanwhile, without delaying his cultivation, He Song started to study the Array Tao Introduction in his mind every day.

33 Chapter 33: Master Cheng Shan Translator: 549690339 Array Tao Introduction was difficult.   But no matter how difficult.   As long as there was talent in array tao, and with time, it was still relatively simple to master the basics.   As time passed.   He Song continued to study the Array Tao Introduction, feeling that he was not too far from mastering it.   Although at this moment he hadn’t entered and couldn’t arrange even the simplest Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song was not discouraged.   Because under constant study, he had already begun to learn to draw array patterns on stones so that he could be more proficient in drawing them on spirit stones in the future.   Meanwhile, after a few days of seclusive cultivation, He Song released a sound-transmitting paper crane.   After releasing the sound-transmitting paper crane, He Song resumed his daily grueling cultivation.   Outer perimeter of the Immortal Pavilion.   He Song’s neighboring house.   A flash of tunneling light arrived in an instant, landing straight in front of a sturdy figure.   “Hmm? Sound Transmission Skill?” A familiar voice came out from this person’s mouth. If He Song was here, he would be able to recognize this person as his neighbor, Lin Cong, with just one glance.   Lin Cong, who had just broken through to the Qi-refining mid stage, was originally consolidating his cultivation.   But this sudden flash of light brought him out of his cultivation state.   Releasing a trace of his own spirit Qi.   The sound-transmitting paper crane in front of him turned into a piece of paper.   Picking up the paper, Lin Cong’s expression quickly turned serious.   “Mr. Lin, I apologize for my abrupt departure without notice. There was a reason for it.”   “The matter of the Red Spirit Gold Mine, which you and I heard about at the Osmanthus Pavilion, after a lot of inquiries, I found that the Red Spirit Gold Mine may be facing trouble. Hence, this letter.”   “If anything happens to the Red Spirit Gold Mine, Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion will be the first to bear the brunt. When the Pavilion is in turmoil, our cultivation will be weak and we may face great difficulties.”   “I have already found a safe place to wait for the right time.”   “I hope Mr. Lin will make early preparations and never mention this to anyone else.”   “He Song.”   Gazing over the paper, a wave of spirit power quickly appeared in Lin Cong’s hand.   After the wave of spirit power disappeared, the paper in Lin Cong’s hand drifted away with the wind.   When the paper completely vanished, Lin Cong sat on his meditation mat with a changing expression, unsure of what he was thinking.   After a long while.    “Sigh, I’ll leave for now!” After a struggle in his heart, Lin Cong sighed and finally made a decision.   At the same time, Lin Cong firmly remembered He Song’s letter in his heart.   This time, He Song saved his life once again!   Lin Cong left.   An hour after receiving He Song’s sound-transmitting paper crane.   He packed up his belongings and stood in front of He Song’s house for a long time, as if trying to remember this place.   It was a long time before he walked out of the Immortal Pavilion with his luggage.   …   Time slowly passed as He Song continued to cultivate, his strength constantly improving, and his understanding of the Array Tao Introduction deepening.   During this period, He Song had a very regular routine.   Besides cultivating, he studied the Array Tao Introduction and occasionally chatted and drank tea with Wei Fan to relax his mood.   Apart from that, He Song did nothing else.   Every day he indulged in cultivation and comprehension, as if everything had nothing to do with him.   However, for He Song.   External matters had nothing to do with him in the first place.   Spirit field? The spirit field had someone to take care of it.   Mining? Only the suicidal would go mining.   Visiting friends? Wasn’t he living at his best friend’s house now?   Thus, for the past three months, He Song spent his days cultivating and studying the Array Tao Introduction, rapidly improving his cultivation and deepening his understanding of the Array Tao Introduction.   One day.   At dusk.   At Wei Fan’s invitation, He Song left his quiet room and went to the attic in the courtyard with Wei Fan.   The attic was not completely enclosed, open on all four sides and offering a beautiful view.   There, Wei Fan had set up a round table and a tea set.   In their free time, they sat in the attic, drinking tea and chatting, their eyes scanning the surroundings, and able to see everything happening around them.   “I don’t know how Lao Meng is doing at that Red Spirit Gold Mine. He hasn’t sent out any news since the last three months.” Wei Fan sighed as he looked towards the beautiful scenery of the setting sun in the distance.   For three months, Meng Guan had only sent He Song and Wei Fan a sound-transmitting paper crane, then there had been no more news.   Wei Fan was worried.   So was He Song.   But they both knew that even if they were worried, there was nothing they could do.    Both of them were in the Immortal Pavilion, while Meng Guan was in the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   Being in different areas, there was almost no possibility for them to help each other.   Not to mention He Song’s weak foundation, even leaving the Immortal Pavilion would probably be a dangerous undertaking.   “I’ve sent him a few sound-transmitting paper cranes, but I don’t know if he received them or not.” He Song had a worried expression, but his gaze gradually turned to the side.   In the center of the area where Wei Fan lived, there was an exquisite courtyard.   This courtyard was situated higher than all the other surrounding courtyards, making it stand out like a crane in a flock of chickens.   There was the most abundant spirit Qi in the Immortal Pavilion.   At the same time, it was the only place where a Foundation Establishment Master resided in the Immortal Pavilion.   This Master’s dharma title was Cheng Shan.   For the past three months, He Song had once seen Master Cheng Shan from a distance.   Master Cheng Shan, like most cultivators, appeared as a young man wearing exquisite mana robes.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com   As for Artifacts, He Song had never seen them.   But, just at a glance, He Song could feel an extremely dense spiritual pressure emanating from him.   This spiritual pressure was very strong, and upon sensing it, He Song knew instantly that the Master could crush him with a casual gesture.   This was no exaggeration.   He Song even felt that even if his cultivation broke through to the Qi-refining late stage, he would still be killed with a single touch, with no unexpected occurrences.   This Master Cheng Shan was the only Foundation Establishment cultivator in the Immortal Pavilion.   At the same time, he was the linchpin.   As long as he was there, the Immortal Pavilion would not be in chaos.   However.   Just as He Song was talking and unconsciously looking at that exquisite courtyard.   A tunneling light suddenly flashed in front of He Song’s eyes, carrying a dense spiritual pressure, and swiftly flew towards the distance.   The tunneling light was earth-yellow.   It seemed to have flown out of that exquisite courtyard.   That dense spiritual pressure also gave He Song a familiar feeling.   The earth-yellow tunneling light streaked across the sky.   For a moment, He Song and Wei Fan, who had been drinking tea and chatting, fell into a deadly silence.   Silence.   Silence.   After a long time.   He Song and Wei Fan looked at each other.   Both saw a trace of horror in each other’s eyes.   “The Immortal Pavilion is going to fall into chaos!” It was not until now that Wei Fan finally managed to squeeze out a sentence from his mouth.   Looking in the direction where the tunneling light had gone, a hint of relief quickly appeared in Wei Fan’s eyes.action

34 Chapter 34: Domineering Translator: 549690339 Fortunately.   He Song had already discussed with him before March what the scene would look like should Master Cheng Shan leave and chaos erupts in Immortal Pavilion.   Now that Master Cheng Shan has indeed suddenly departed, his mind won’t be disturbed.   That’s because he and He Song had made full preparations over these three months.   Spirit amulets.   Artifacts.   Mana robes.   He hadn’t previously prepared these things for magical battles.action   He had encountered no danger in the Immortal Pavilion, so he initially thought it unnecessary to invest resources in these items.   However, when He Song expounded on the pros and cons in great detail, he gritted his teeth and set aside some for himself.   Now, having just recently advanced to the Qi-refining late stage, his combat power had become rather strong.   He had also prepared some spirit amulets specially designed for magic battles.   In this way, even though Master Cheng Shan suddenly left, their safety wasn’t a worry.   “I ask that you retreat back into the courtyard. Leave the outside matters to me. If any danger arises…please use the Earth Tunneling Amulet to leave.” Thinking of the artifacts and spirit amulets on him, Wei Fan spoke, his face showing a calm expression.   During these three months, he’d not only purchased artifacts, spirit amulets, and mana robes for himself, enhancing his own fighting strength, but he also purchased two life-saving spirit amulets.   Earth Tunneling Amulet.   The Earth Tunneling Amulet is a high-quality spirit amulet. After use, it enables you to move ten miles underground in a flash, enough to escape any Qi-refining stage cultivator pursuing you.   Wei Fan prepared one such life-saving spirit amulet for himself.   At the same time, he lent one to He Song.   Although he himself was a cultivator in the Qi-refining late stage, and those living around him were also at the same stage.   However, better be safe than sorry.   Having been good friends with He Song for so long, he had also become more careful.   In case he gets overpowered and the Qi-refining late stage cultivators around him prove unreliable, with these two Earth Tunneling Amulets on them, they could still quickly escape, perhaps spare their lives, and be able to make a comeback.   That’s why these two Earth Tunneling Amulets were their ultimate trump cards.   “Okay, Brother Wei, be careful.” Nodding, He Song didn’t retort and directly sought refuge in the courtyard, practicing the Breath Concealment Formulas, letting his own breath dissipate into nothingness.   From the outside, he wouldn’t be much help, and it might even make him a target for Evil Cultivators.   A Qi-refining early-stage cultivator lived in the home of a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator.   In the eyes of the Evil Cultivator, the relationship between the two must be extraordinary.    If he were to be captured and used to threaten Wei Fan, it probably would be counterproductive.   Rather than being counterproductive, it’s better to hide in the small courtyard, use the Breath Concealment Formulas to pretend to be non-existent. That way, Wei Fan can confront the crisis more composed.   On the loft.   As soon as Wei Fan put away the tea set, he felt He Song’s breath rapidly disappear within the small courtyard.   Sensing this, Wei Fan’s expression remained unchanged, but he commended He Song in his heart.   His friend was not deeply cultivated, but when it came to caution, he was one of the top. At least among the people he knew, He Song was the most cautious.   Wei Fan had felt the benefits of being cautious.   If not for He Song’s cautiousness, his spirit amulets and artifacts would probably still be the ones he used during his Qi-refining mid stage.   But now?   The spirit amulets and artifacts on him, even the mana robes, were all now those used in the Qi-refining late stage.   In this way, even if his cultivation is only at seventh-tier Qi Refining, he wouldn’t need to worry about his safety when facing other Qi-refining late stage cultivators.   It could be said that, if it weren’t for He Song’s cautiousness, he might not be as calm as he is now.   Not to mention patiently waiting at home.   This waiting.   Lasted an entire night.   This night, Immortal Pavilion was as quiet as before.   As if Master Cheng Shan’s departure hadn’t caused much turbulence.   However, the suddenly rising prices of the spirit amulets, artifacts, and mana robes in the Immortal Pavilion the next morning made the sensitive cultivators feel something was afoot.   Some uninformed Loose cultivators grumbled, saying that the Immortal Pavilion was shameless for raising prices.   Some well-informed Loose cultivators silently took out spirit stones and began purchasing all sorts of life-saving items.   The prices of spirit amulets, artifacts, and mana robes began to rise again.   To purchase these life-saving items, many well-informed cultivators emptied their coffers overnight.   And the cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion in charge of selling these items were mostly unaware of what was going on but faced with countless cultivators coming to buy life-saving items, they could only sell as usual.   Although they didn’t know why the higher-ups suddenly raised prices, the cultivators at the bottom wouldn’t think too hard.   Rather, people started coming in even larger numbers after the price hike, leaving them rather perplexed.   On the first day.   He Song and Wei Fan stayed within the small courtyard without venturing out.   Most of the Loose Cultivators in the outside world had a routine day, living, cultivating, practicing seclusion, and making breakthroughs in the Immortal Pavilion.   And the prices of artifacts, spirit amulets, and mana robes began to rise.   The second day.    He Song and Wei Fan remained in the small courtyard without venturing out.   The prices of artifacts, spirit amulets, and mana robes continued to rise.   Some Loose cultivators with sharper instincts seemed to have detected something, and started to buy life-saving items in droves.   More hasty figures appeared among the pedestrians on the street.   The third day.   He Song and Wei Fan remained in the small courtyard without venturing out.   Several bodies of Loose cultivators were found in the dark corners of the Immortal Pavilion.   The Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team came to investigate but found nothing and had to leave at that.   At the same time.   Most of the artifacts in the Artifacts Pavilion had been sold out. Despite the endless stream of Loose cultivators coming to buy, the remaining artifacts in the pavilion were exorbitantly priced.   Still, they were quickly sold out.   All the spirit amulets in the Spirit Amulet Pavilion were sold out, and the Loose cultivators coming to buy started flooding into the Stall Section.   However, the spirit amulets in the Stall Section had also long been sold out.   As for the mana robes in the Spirit Clothes Pavilion… they were not something common Loose Cultivators could afford. Only Qi-refining late-stage cultivators, or Qi-refining mid-stage cultivators with high wealth, were able to afford them.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m   The fourth day.   He Song and Wei Fan continued to stay in the small courtyard, without stepping out of it.   Somebody heard the sounds of intense magical battle last night, but no one dared to investigate.   Only in the early hours of the morning did some start gingerly stepping out onto the streets.   Then they found bodies lying at all angles on a street.   Among the bodies were unknown cultivators dressed in black and masked, and also some nearby cultivators who sneaked out to look around.   When this news spread, the entire Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was immediately aflame with panic.   Swiftly, the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team issued announcements to every household.   “Evil Cultivators have infiltrated the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and are wantonly murdering. The Law Enforcement Team is apprehending the Evil Cultivators.”   “Anyone harboring Evil Cultivators, death!”   “Anyone shielding Evil Cultivators, death!”   “Anyone withholding information, death!”   “Anyone seizing the opportunity for theft, death!”   “Anyone refusing to cooperate, death!”   “Anyone colluding with Evil Cultivators, death!”   “…”   Blood-red death appeared in children’s size right in front of their eyes, causing He Song frown bit.   It’s the first time he had seen such a blood-soaked announcement where death is the resort for any slight incident.   It was so overbearing.

Chapter 35: Chapter 35 Green Mountain Seal   Translator: 549690339   Folding the notice in his hand, He Song looked towards Wei Fan with a frown.   Just now, a monk from the Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team had delivered the notice for the two of them to inspect, and they had seen the rows of blood-red letters spelling “death”.   In the past few days, He Song and Wei Fan had not left the house, but both of them belonged to the kind of cultivators who had many friends.   Therefore, even though they hadn’t been out, they had still received quite a bit of information about the outside world from others.   Now, they were quite familiar with the situation outside.   They knew what kind of events had transpired outside.   “Sure enough, as soon as Master Cheng Shan leaves, the Immortal Pavilion gets chaotic right away.” Sitting by the table, Wei Fan sighed with a hint of complexity in his eyes.   He had many friends beyond He Song and Meng Guan’s small circle, including loose cultivators and monks from the Immortal Pavilion.   All of these friends had one thing in common.   They all lived in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and had some contact with him, the steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion. Now that the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was in chaos,.   Wei Fan wondered whether his friends would survive or not.   With this thought in mind, the complexity in Wei Fan’s eyes quickly dissipated, followed by a bitter smile and a shake of his head.   His power was limited; he could only shelter those closest to him. As for other friends… he had never even reminded them once from beginning to end.   Even in safe times, he had never thought of reminding them, let alone now that the Immortal Pavilion was in chaos.   What was the point of thinking about this now?   Wei Fan quickly threw away this idea.   He and He Song were not saints, willing to risk themselves for a stranger.   He would only choose to protect those closest to him when he had the power to do so and would not have any impact on himself.   Such as He Song and Meng Guan.   The three of them had formed a small circle in a short time for this reason.   He Song, Meng Guan, and Wei Fan were not compassionate cultivators, and they would only help those closest to them when they had the power to do so and without affecting themselves.   Perhaps because they shared the same interests, the three of them got along well.   As for others, what did they have to do with Wei Fan?   “Evil cultivators are rampant! We shouldn’t go outside for now. Let’s wait for Master Cheng Shan to return or for a new Foundation Establishment Master to arrive from the Thick Earth Sect,” He Song frowned and said after pondering.    He didn’t know what Wei Fan was thinking at the moment.   He just wanted to make the two of them as safe as possible, so he made this suggestion.   Wei Fan had no objections to He Song’s caution.   So even though they saw the announcement, they didn’t go outside to check anything.   Instead, they stayed at home just like the previous days, quietly waiting.   On the fifth day, He Song and Wei Fan still stayed at home.   The sound of cultivators using artifacts to attack.   The fluctuations of spirit power when cultivators cast spells. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m  The occasional angry shouts during cultivator fights.   As well as some strange noises – eerie laughter and cold breaths mixed together, making all the low-level cultivators shiver in their homes.   Only a few brave and skilled cultivators dared to leave their houses to investigate.   Of course, whether these cultivators were actually going out to investigate or to plunder was unknown.   Most of these cultivators who left their houses, didn’t make it back.   When daylight began to show, the low-level cultivators finally dared to open the door and leave their rooms.   But they were soon shocked by the scene before them.   On the streets, corpses were scattered everywhere. Some belonged to Law Enforcement Team members, others to masked individuals in black.   But most of them were ordinary loose cultivators who had left their houses.   It wasn’t until noon that Law Enforcement Team members came to collect the bodies of their fellows, but no one dared to touch the other corpses.   On the sixth day, He Song and Wei Fan still stayed at home.   Last night, there was no fierce battle on the outskirts of the Immortal Pavilion.   However, the oppressive atmosphere had already made the cultivators living on the outer edge of the Immortal Pavilion panic.   Some wanted to flee, but their corpses were soon found by the roadside.   Some wanted to hide, but where could one hide within the Immortal Pavilion?   Some wanted to go in the inner ring of the Immortal Pavilion, but without a place to live, they were quickly chased away by Law Enforcement Team members.   However, well-informed people already knew that the outer edge of the Immortal Pavilion had been abandoned by the Law Enforcement Team.   After the fierce battle the night before, the Law Enforcement Team suffered heavy losses and had to retreat to the inner circle of the Immortal Pavilion.    In other words, the outer edge of the Immortal Pavilion was now left completely undefended.   For the loose cultivators and even the internal staff of the Immortal Pavilion who reside there, they could only resign themselves to fate and pray that the evil cultivators wouldn’t target them.   The entire outer edge of the Immortal Pavilion had been completely abandoned.   On the seventh day, He Song and Wei Fan remained at home.   Last night, the retreating Law Enforcement Team and the evil cultivators clashed again.   Although the Law Enforcement Team suffered a number of losses, thanks to the late-stage Qi Refining cultivators who lived in the inner circle lending a hand, they were able to repel the evil cultivators.   Once the evil cultivators retreated, no more news came from the outer edge of the Immortal Pavilion.   He Song and Wei Fan, who lived in a small courtyard, had completely lost contact with the outer edge of the Immortal Pavilion.   It was not difficult to imagine the outcome for those loose cultivators who resided on the outer edge of the Immortal Pavilion.   On the eighth day, He Song and Wei Fan still stayed at home.   They constantly paid attention to the situation outside.   After two battles with the evil cultivators, the Law Enforcement Team had suffered severe losses.   However, He Song and Wei Fan waited for a day without any sound coming from the outside.   It was as if the entire Immortal Pavilion had become a city of the dead.   Unsettlingly quiet.   Until…   “You rats! You’re courting death!” A roar came from far away in the sky, reaching He Song’s and Wei Fan’s ears.   He Song and Wei Fan were startled and hurried to the window to look in the distance.   For a while, countless cultivators looked around from their buildings.   In the distance, high in the sky,   Master Cheng Shan, clad in his yellow mana robes, looked furious as he stared at the dilapidated Immortal Pavilion before him. The rage in his eyes was almost enough to burn everything.   He had been ordered to guard the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   But a few days ago, the Red Spirit Gold Mine had sent a distress signal, forcing him to temporarily leave.   He didn’t expect that in just a few days, the once-prosperous Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion would turn into such a mess!   As the guardian, he could not shirk responsibility.   At this moment, with all his efforts in vain, anyone would be anxious.   Then, He Song found out why Cheng Shan was called Master Cheng Shan. Under the gazes of countless cultivators,   Master Cheng Shan waved his hand, and a miniature mountain emerged from it.   The Green Mountain Seal!

Chapter 36: Chapter 36: The Might of Foundation Establishment (Happy New Year)   Translator: 549690339   It was precisely because of the existence of this seal that Master Cheng Shan had chosen the dharma title Cheng Shan.   This was his long-cultivated and famous artifact!   The Green Mountain Seal flew out of Master Cheng Shan’s hand, swirling in midair, and soon grew to an immense size.   It changed from a miniature mountain that could be held in hand to a giant boulder several dozens of feet in size!   Such a massive stone seal, with just a casual strike, would possess unimaginable power.   Now, as it was being utilized by a Foundation Establishment Master, its power was naturally apparent under the reinforcement of the Foundation Establishment Realm’s mana.   The Green Mountain Seal had not yet fallen.   He Song saw a group of black-robed cultivators fleeing in panic from the periphery of the Immortal Pavilion, desperately running toward the outside of the pavilion.   These fleeing cultivators were the evil cultivators who had been engaged in a large battle with the Law Enforcement Team previously.   It could be due to inaccurate information.   Or it could be due to their excessive greed.   These evil cultivators had been wreaking havoc within the Immortal Pavilion for so many days, yet they still had the guts to stay here.   However, looking at their numbers, He Song frowned a bit.   The number of these black-robed cultivators was too small, only a dozen or so.   These dozen or so cultivators should not have posed such a massive threat to the Law Enforcement Team of the Immortal Pavilion.   While puzzled in his heart,   He Song’s expression remained unchanged, his eyes not even blinking, as he stared intently at the Green Mountain Seal in midair.   This was his first time witnessing a Foundation Establishment Master taking action.   In the past, due to never having left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, he had not even seen the full power of a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator.   Now that he had the chance, he naturally wanted to gain some insights.   Under the watchful eyes of many cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion like He Song,   the Green Mountain Seal that was originally floating in midair began to move at this moment.   It was not as heavy as He Song had imagined.   The enormous Green Mountain Seal was fast like lightning, and under the urging of Master Cheng Shan’s mana, it smashed toward the group of black-robed cultivators like a meteorite.    Those black-robed cultivators were also quite alert, seeing the Green Mountain Seal closing in on them; they instantly transformed into birds and beasts scattering in all directions, fleeing in every direction.   He Song looked closely and even noticed that each of them was escaping in different directions.   Apart from nobody running into the Immortal Pavilion, there was a fleeing cultivator in almost every other direction.   It seemed that each of these cultivators was adept at escaping, all knowing to scatter and flee.   Boom!   With a loud rumble,   the huge boulder transformed by the Green Mountain Seal slammed into the ground, creating a gigantic crater in the originally solid earth.   The massive boulder, relying on inertia, continued forward, plowing a deep trench in the ground. However, the seemingly powerful attack, was all thunder and no rain.   The strong attack that carved a deep trench in the ground, did not even touch a hair on those loose cultivators.   For a moment, the Immortal Pavilion cultivators who were watching all this were somewhat taken aback.   Even He Song, looking at Master Cheng Shan, could not help but feel a hint of astonishment in his eyes. A Foundation Establishment Master?   That’s it?   Even when using an artifact to smash people, he could miss?   What about your divine sense?   However, just as He Song was thinking so, his peripheral vision caught a glimpse of something amiss.   A golden thread that was nearly invisible to the naked eye had connected all the fleeing black-robed cultivators at this moment.   If it hadn’t been for He Song’s peripheral vision noticing the difference between that golden thread and the surrounding environment, he might have completely overlooked it.   Moving his gaze away from Master Cheng Shan, He Song’s eyes turned, quickly confirming that he hadn’t seen wrong.   And it was at this moment,   that Master Cheng Shan’s cold snort sounded, as the golden thread vanished with a slight movement of his finger.   Immediately afterwards,   those black-robed cultivators who had been fleeing in all directions suddenly had their bodies separated from their heads, falling to the ground as rolling bloody gourds.   They didn’t even have the chance to let out a scream before they had already fallen dead.   In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen cultivators had their bodies and heads separated, and their corpses dismembered.   Among these black-robed cultivators,   some were at the Qi-refining late stage, while others were at the Qi-refining mid stage.   For He Song and the other cultivators living on the periphery of the Immortal Pavilion, these people had high cultivation levels and strong abilities.    If they were to face them head-on, they would have no chance of resisting.   The only thing they could do was pray that they wouldn’t catch their attention.   However, in the face of a Foundation Establishment Master, these cultivators, who had once been powerful and domineering in the periphery of the Immortal Pavilion, became like ants, easily annihilated by Master Cheng Shan.   With just a casual strike, Master Cheng Shan had turned these cultivators into corpses scattered across the ground.   For a moment, the entire Immortal Pavilion was as quiet as a pin drop.   Everyone had been stunned by Master Cheng Shan’s move.   A Foundation Establishment Master casually exterminating more than a dozen evil cultivators, showcasing the indisputable power of his realm.   He Song’s gaze swept over the bloody corpses of the cultivators outside the Immortal Pavilion, and he felt his scalp tingle.   Is this… the Foundation Establishment Realm?   What a domineering presence!   What a majestic style!   Such an amazing strength!   However, after annihilating these dozen or so evil cultivators, Master Cheng Shan looked into the distance and coldly snorted.   “You guys sure know how to run fast!” After saying this, Master Cheng Shan looked inside the Immortal Pavilion, his expression carrying a hint of blame.   “What are you standing around for? Hurry up and rebuild the Immortal Pavilion!” Leaving these words behind, Master Cheng Shan casually waved his hand, and dozens of storage bags flew up from the ground, landing in his hand.   At the same time, a earthy-yellow tunneling light fell directly into the exquisite courtyard in the center of the Immortal Pavilion.   It wasn’t until Master Cheng Shan’s figure had completely disappeared a moment later, that the formerly silent Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion slowly “revived.”   After experiencing several days of devastation by the evil cultivators, the periphery of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion had been almost completely destroyed.   The majority of the rental houses in the outer area were in ruins, and only a few unoccupied rooms remained intact.   However, now that Master Cheng Shan had returned, the safety of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion had instantly increased countless times.   Even He Song dared to go out with Wei Fan and look around the outside world.   The outside was very safe.   As He Song followed Wei Fan out the door, both of their eyes flashed with a   hint of joy at surviving the ordeal.   However, when their gaze fell upon the ruined houses in the periphery of the Immortal Pavilion, they suddenly felt a surge of sadness. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com  “Alas, I wonder how many of my friends are still alive after this disaster,” Wei Fan said while walking side by side with He Song, his gaze sweeping over the surrounding broken scenery and sighing.   Although he had not warned those friends to leave the Immortal Pavilion in advance, although he had not chosen to shelter those friends, and although he had not done anything for those friends, he did not lack sighs of emotion.   Ordinary friends, unlike close friends like He Song and Meng Guan, held no sentimental value in life or death and no apparent benefit for their survival.   In the cruel Cultivation World, the only value lies within survival.   At the same time, disregarding the lives of others had almost become the most basic common sense for cultivators..

Chapter 37: Taking by Surprise      One's self is the most important.   In most situations, it is enough to take care of oneself.   If it does not affect oneself, it is not impossible to help those who are extremely close to oneself.   But if they want to be a saint when it's dangerous, such cultivators usually don't live long.   "If it hadn't been for your cautiousness, I would probably die in that disaster too," He Song listened to Wei Fan's sigh, his expression becoming somber.   If it wasn't for his own caution and Wei Fan's willingness to lend a hand.   He's afraid he would have only ended up leaving the Immortal Pavilion and going to the mortal world as a loose cultivator.   If he didn't leave.   The fate of the loose cultivators outside the Immortal Pavilion would have been his fate.   After this ordeal, He Song also began to be vigilant within himself.   In the future, he must be more cautious.   One must absolutely not be careless, lest in this cruel Cultivation World, they risk their own life.   "Brother Wei, after today, I'll return to the outside of the Immortal Pavilion once again. I could only escape this disaster with your great help, and I will never forget your kindness."   When they arrived at the outskirts of Immortal Pavilion, He Song, from a distance, saw that his original house had not been damaged, and quickly thanked Wei Fan with a salute.   Although he had a backup plan in his heart, gratitude was still gratitude, and He Song firmly remembered Wei Fan's kindness.   He had already taken all the tokens and other items with him when he left Wei Fan's residence.   Now that Master Cheng Shan had returned and the crisis was resolved, He Song would not continue to live in Wei Fan's courtyard.   It was inconvenient.   And it made He Song feel like he was living under someone else's roof.   This feeling made He Song somewhat uncomfortable.   Wei Fan, although a good friend, when the crisis of Immortal Pavilion was resolved, He Song was eager to return to his own residence.   Not for any other reason, just for the sake of feeling more at ease.   "We shouldn't be so formal with each other. You stay here first, and when the first of next month comes, I'll transfer the rights to this house to your name, and only then will we start calculating the rent."   Wei Fan shook his head, not retaining He Song.            But he used his power to save He Song a few spirit stones.   As a Qi Refining late stage cultivator and Steward of Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Wei Fan had some influence in Spirit Construction Pavilion, and with just a casual remark, he was able to save He Song nearly a month's rent.   However, it was also due to the recent disaster at Immortal Pavilion that most of the houses built by Spirit Construction Pavilion were damaged, and reconstruction would take some time. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com  Therefore, he was able to say this.   If it were an ordinary time, even as a Steward of Spirit Construction Pavilion, he would not have such power.   This was a small favor he did for He Song.   After sending He Song home, Wei Fan made an excuse to leave.   As a Steward of Spirit Construction Pavilion, most of the rental houses on the outskirts of the Immortal Pavilion had been damaged. He would be busy for a long time.   It was only because of bringing He Song home safely that he had made this trip.   If it hadn't been for this, he probably would have appeared in the Spirit Construction Pavilion the moment Master Cheng Shan returned to Immortal Pavilion.   Back at home.   He Song opened his door.   Only after entering the room did he find that the originally tidy room had become extremely messy.   He Song had cleaned the house before leaving, but now it was unrecognizable.   It seemed that someone had visited the place, perhaps an Evil Cultivator or someone else.   These messy items seemed to have been moved around by someone.   But He Song had taken everything with him before leaving, leaving only worthless things behind.   Therefore, there was no loss.   However, although there was no loss, the mess made He Song frown.   Helpless.   He simply started to tidy up.   As a cultivator, one's physical strength is definitely much stronger than ordinary people.   With the spirit power in their body, He Song was able to quickly clean the room.   Soon, the messy room regained its original tidiness.   He Song then sat at his desk, where he had been for more than five years.            He poured himself a pot of tea   His mind flashed with the experiences of this period.   Three months ago, He Song went to live in Wei Fan's home because of his cautiousness.   In a blink of an eye, it's already been three months.   Until today, He Song finally moved out of Wei Fan's home and returned to his own.   Throughout these three months, He Song didn't feel anything wrong.   But thinking back to the scene this morning where Master Cheng Shan killed people in the marketplace, He Song began to wonder if something was wrong.   With the dharma title 'Cheng Shan', one may assume his magic weapon would be the Green Mountain Seal.   However, when seen today, Master Cheng Shan's huge Green Mountain Seal did not seem to show its power.   Instead, Master Cheng Shan eventually used a nearly invisible golden thread to defeat the Evil Cultivators.   Compared to that, He Song is more inclined to believe that the huge Green Mountain Seal is just a decoy.   Specifically to attract the attention of others.   Even willing to use his own dharma title as a cover.   Unfamiliar people hearing the dharma title would pay extra attention to the Green Mountain Seal in his hand.   However, the golden thread in Master Cheng Shan's hand is only his real trump card.   From the beginning, not only He Song, but also the other cultivators, and even the evil cultivators, had focused on the Green Mountain Seal.   It wasn't until later on that the golden thread showed its might, and everyone was amazed at Master Cheng Shan's powerful strength with an expression of bewilderment.   However, He Song was the only one who noticed the golden thread.   It seems that no one else knew what was used to kill the evil cultivators.   That artifact resembling a golden thread went unnoticed.   "Using a dharma title and related artifacts as a cover, while finding another unnoticed artifact as a trump card, striking unexpectedly and attacking when the enemy is unprepared..."   He Song thought for a moment, quickly understood Master Cheng Shan's strategy.   It was because He Song noticed the nearly invisible golden thread that he was able to deduce so much information.   If he hadn't noticed the golden thread, he likely would not have been able to figure out how Master Cheng Shan defeated the evil cultivators.   "Sure enough, one should never underestimate others in this world. Foundation Establishment cultivators can work step by step, setting traps for people, let alone higher-level cultivators." He Song, now fully understanding everything, became even more vigilant about the cultivators in this world.   In this cruel Cultivation World, hiding cards and spreading fog seems to be something that every cultivator does.   This not only enhances one's chances of survival,   but also acquires more means.   Even allowing oneself to kill enemies more easily.   His mind kept flashing images of his experiences, He Song's expression quickly calmed down.

Chapter 38: Chapter 38: 3 Years   Translator: 549690339   Apart from narrowly escaping at Wei Fan’s home and finding out that Master Cheng Shan was actually an old sixth member, He Song racked his brain, but he found no other gains to speak of.   Nevertheless, over the next few days, He Song devoted some of his time to learn more about the situation outside the Immortal Pavilion while practicing his cultivation.   Even though the outer perimeter of the Immortal Pavilion had suffered from the rampage of evil cultivators, not all cultivators had been killed.   Some cultivators were spared either because their cultivation was too low to be noticed, or they possessed various life-saving means and managed to endure the onslaught.   Still, others survived because they hid well and eventually gathered together, accounting for about a quarter of the original population.   From the stories of these surviving cultivators, He Song learned what had happened outside the Immortal Pavilion when the evil cultivators attacked.   The outer perimeter of the Immortal Pavilion initially experienced a spreading panic.   Law Enforcement Team then left.   Subsequently, the evil cultivators ran rampant through three phases.   The first phase wasn’t too bad, with cultivators nervously using their spirit stones to buy life-saving items.   That was when the prices of life-saving items in the Immortal Pavilion skyrocketed.   In the second phase, the Law Enforcement Team was forced to evacuate to the inner circle after their first battle with the Evil Cultivators.   Loose cultivators in the outer perimeter of the Immortal Pavilion were utterly miserable during this phase.   A cultivator practiced Breath Concealment Formulas in hopes of hiding at home and avoiding detection by evil cultivators.   However, since the formulas only concealed one’s breath and did not provide invisibility, he was quickly discovered. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only  His fate was, of course, unspeakable.   Other loose cultivators who used various means to escape the catastrophe also mostly ended up discovered and met a tragic fate.   Only a few cultivators had the power to fight back and kill some evil cultivators, or hide well enough to remain undiscovered, or had a low cultivation level at the first-tier Qi Refining, which was not worth the attention of evil cultivators, thus they lived.   Neutralizing the rampage of evil cultivators was the third phase.   At this stage, there were few cultivators outside the Immortal Pavilion, and most of them were in hiding.   As a result, the evil cultivators couldn’t find anyone to plunder and had to attack the inner circle.   However, with the help of late-stage Qi-refining cultivators from the inner circle, the evil cultivators’ offensive was thwarted.    Seeing that success was impossible, most of the evil cultivators left, leaving only some who still wished to make a small fortune on the outer perimeter of the Immortal Pavilion.   As for the people who had survived, some had become wealthy overnight due to the substantial plundering opportunities.   For unknown reasons.   He Song could not help but gasp when he heard about this.   He was secretly relieved that he had followed Wei Fan to the inner circle, because, with his third-tier Qi Refining cultivation, he might have died directly outside the Immortal Pavilion.   Either they were powerful enough to repel evil cultivators,   Or they were skilled in hiding, able to evade detection by evil cultivators,   Or they were just entering the first-tier Qi Refining stage, having no spirit stones on their bodies, and even the evil cultivators saw them as beneath their contempt.   Apart from that, those with neither superior power nor hiding ability, and their cultivation level above the second-tier of Qi Refining, were the unlucky ones. He Song was confident that, with his current life-saving abilities, he might have been one of these unfortunate souls.   “It seems that, from now on, I need to not only be cautious and diligent in my cultivation, but also strengthen my life-saving abilities.”   Silently setting a goal for himself, He Song shook his head and went to the spirit field he managed.   He Song’s five-acre spirit field was once again under his own management.   The spiritual plant farmer who had helped him manage the spirit field before had died in the catastrophe.   Originally, He Song had promised him twenty spirit stones, but now he didn’t have to give them anymore.   That fellow had managed He Song’s spirit field for three months for nothing, only to meet his end in the calamity.   It was a tragedy and lamentable.   Moreover, after returning to the outer perimeter of the Immortal Pavilion, He Song sent sound transmission messages to a few friends he knew.   However, only Zhao Lin from the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and Lin Cong, who had already fled Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, replied to He Song.   The rest were all missing without trace.   He didn’t know whether these people were dead or trapped somewhere, unable to see the sound-transmitting paper crane He Song had released.   However, He Song believed it was likely that they were dead.   Three-quarters of the cultivators outside the Immortal Pavilion were dead, and only one-quarter were left.   Those with weak means and poor concealment ability, with cultivation neither high nor low, were almost wiped out.   After this calamity, Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion had become much emptier.    Although the Spirit Construction Pavilion quickly restored the place to its original state, those fallen cultivators would never return.   The number of cultivators inside the Immortal Pavilion would need time to recover.   In the mortal world.   Every year, people become loose cultivators.   In a few years, or a decade or so, Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion will once again become as bustling as it was before.   Time flies.   Three years have passed since Master Cheng Shan left and Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was attacked by evil cultivators.   Over these three years, Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion returned to its usual tranquility, and He Song continued to study Array Tao Introduction. However, he still couldn’t set up even the simplest Spirit-Gathering Array.   This wasn’t because He Song lacked talent in array tao.   On the contrary, He Song had acquired a deep understanding of setting up Spirit-Gathering Arrays.   Now, He Song has started attempting to engrave array patterns on spirit stones, which has resulted in him spending almost all of his earned spirit stones on this practice over the past three years.   Engraving affay patterns on spirit stones is one of the prereallisites for setting   up a Spirit-Gathering Array.   But engraving them often damages the spirit stones, causing the spirit Qi within to leak, which he could only absorb.   As a result, He Song could never save up enough spirit stones.   However, his cultivation had reached the peak of the third-tier Qi Refining due to absorbing spirit Qi from the damaged spirit stones.   To advance to the Qi-refining mid-stage like Lin Cong, all he needed was to break through with his ongoing meditation.   And, because of his constant practice with spirit stones, He Song’s ability to engrave array patterns on spirit stones was becoming more and more skillful.   It seemed that it wouldn’t be long before he could set up a Spirit-Gathering Array.   Outside Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   In He Song’s house.   Within the quiet meditation chamber.   He Song sat with his eyes closed, with more than a dozen spirit stones placed beside him.   These spirit stones were all that he had left, and he had not hesitated to place them around him in order to break through to the Qi-refining mid-stage.   This method was taught to him by Lin Cong and Wei Fan.   During a breakthrough in minor realms, placing spirit stones close by would increase the chances of a successful breakthrough.   Although the increase wasn’t much, it was a rare and helpful trick for improving breakthrough chances.   Were it not for his friendship with them, no one would teach this small technique to others..

Chapter 39: Chapter 39: Qj-refining mid stage   Translator: 549690339   Today.   It is the day He Song decides to breakthrough to the Qi-refining mid-stage!   Since Lin Cong had already proven that it is not that difficult for someone with four spirit roots to break through the Qi-refining mid-stage, He Song too didn’t prepare anything else after placing a dozen spirit stones around him, he determinedly began the breakthrough.   Breaking through from the third-tier Qi Refining to the fourth is not really difficult.   Of course, this “not difficult” is determined by He Song’s four spirits root talent.   The gap between four spirits root and five spirits root is quite noticeable.   For those with five spirits root, aiming to break from the third level of Qi Refining to the fourth, there will be a substantial bottleneck.   Like Meng Guan.   He has five spirits root.   When breaking through the Qi-refining mid-stage, Meng Guan found it more difficult than those with four spirits root.   During the breakthrough to the Qi-refining late stage, he was even more tormented by the bottleneck.   Just for that breakthrough, he had to leave the Immortal Pavilion to go mining, and he hasn’t returned to this day.   It’S wortn mentiomng tnat a montn atter master cneng snan returned to tne Immortal Pavilion, both He Song and Wei Fan received a sound -transmitting paper crane from Meng Guan.   In the message, Meng Guan said he encountered a huge crisis, and it was fortunate that he was in the mine when it happened. By activating the Breath Concealment Formulas, he hid in a secluded mine for several days before he managed to survive.   At the same time, He Song and Wei Fan learned from him what had happened in the Red Spirit Gold Mine those few days.   The Red Spirit Gold Mine was attacked by several Foundation Establishment Masters and dozens of cultivators in the Qi-refining late stage.   Many of the recruited loose cultivators there were slaughtered on spot.   Even one of the four Foundation Establishment Masters from the Thick Earth Sect, guarding the Red Spirit Gold Mine, was caught off guard and directly killed.   Luckily, among the three remaining Foundation Establishment Masters, one was a hidden Mid-stage Foundation Establishment Master, who forcefully withstood the pressure and sent out a distress signal. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com  The distress signal summoned the guardians of several surrounding Immortal Pavilions. Both sides fought with their spells for several days, each holding their own.   Only after several days, when the Foundation Establishment masters coming to assist from Green Wall Immortal City arrived, did the other party leave.   At the same time,   The guardians of the several surrounding Immortal Pavilions returned to their respective pavilions.    But what Meng Guan didn’t know was that all the Immortal Pavilions around had been attacked by evil cultivators.   Not until later did He Song and Wei Fan find out. Not only the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion had been attacked by evil cultivators, but the other pavilions without Foundation Establishment cultivator guardians were also under attack.   Meng Guan carefully came out of the mine only when the outside world had been quiet for several days, and he returned to the mining team.   After this adventure, Meng Guan was full of sighs. While expressing his gratitude to He Song and Wei Fan for their previous persuasion, he lamented his luck.   But if he had not been short of spirit stones and wanted to try his luck, he would not have gone mining, and so he decided to stay at the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   The Red Spirit Gold Mine now had a few more Foundation Establishment masters guarding it, and its safety had further improved.   Moreover, he had nowhere else to go.   So, he could only continue to mine in the mining area.   Now that three years have passed, all He Song knew was that Meng Guan was still mining, with no knowledge of anything else.   For those with four spirit root,   Like Lin Cong, he didn’t encounter any bottleneck when breaking through to the Qi-refining mid- stage.   When he decided to challenge, the spirit power in his body started to revolve at high speed.   Then he broke through the bottleneck.   It was straightforward.   As he activated the Thick Earth Formulas,   He Song’s body began to absorb the spirit Qi around him constantly.   With the continuous influx of spirit Qi, the spiritual power within He Song’s body began to grow at this moment.   When the spiritual power in his body grew to its maximum.   Continuing to operate the Thick Earth Formulas, He Song instantly felt a complete harmony throughout his body. It was as if his entire being had loosened, and the extreme sense of comfort from the breakthrough in his cultivation instantly surged to his heart.   In a blink of an eye, He Song successfully broke through to the fourth tier of Qi Refining.   Feeling the rapid increase in the spiritual power within his body and detecting the increased speed of the external spirit Qi transforming into his spiritual power, He Song rejoiced.   He succeeded!   Just by operating Thick Earth Formulas, he had naturally broken through to the fourth- tier of Qi Refining.   After enjoying the pleasure of a successful breakthrough in his cultivation.   He Song continued to operate Thick Earth Formulas, beginning to consolidate his cultivation.    If a breakthrough in cultivation has just occurred, any unexpected events could easily cause one to revert back to their previous state.   Only after thoroughly consolidating one’s cultivation can one flawlessly control it without any unexpected issues arising.   This was also why Lin Cong had decided to leave immediately after receiving He Song’s sound-transmitting paper crane.   At that time, Lin Cong had just broken through to the fourth tier of Qi Refining, and still needed to consolidate his cultivation.   It is likely that he would face a lot of trouble if anything unfortunate happened while in the Immortal Pavilion.   Time was fleeting.   In the blink of an eye, a month passed.   During this month, apart from using the Spirit Rain Skill on his managed spirit field for half an hour each day, He Song had stayed at home to consolidate his cultivation.   Now, after a month, He Song’s cultivation at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining has finally been fully consolidated.   At this point, no matter how casually he performed a skill, He Song’s cultivation level would not fall below its present realm.   Not until then.   Did He Song completely set his mind at ease.   He no longer spent each day immersed in the thoughts of consolidating his cultivation.   However, since his cultivation had already broken through to the Qi-refining mid-stage, it was now time for He Song to go to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and expand the number of spirit fields under his management.   In the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, once a cultivator reaches the Qi-refining mid-stage, their status and benefits greatly improve.   Take the case of spiritual plant farmers, for example.   A spiritual plant farmer at the Qi Refining Early Stage, can generally only manage a five-acre spirit field, as the amount of spiritual power in their body is limited, and the Spirit Rain Skill cannot cover a larger area.   Each acre of spirit field yields thirty spirit stones per year, producing a total of one hundred and fifty spirit stones.   But if a spiritual plant farmer breaks through to the Qi-refining mid-stage.   The area of spirit fields they can manage increases to seven acres. Compared to the previous five acres, the addition of two more acres to reach seven acres doesn’t seem like much of a difference.   However, the actual yearly income substantially increases.   Still considering each acre of spirit field yields thirty spirit stones per year, seven acres can produce a total of two hundred and ten spirit stones per year.   After deducting the mandatory one hundred and twenty spirit stones as rent, the number of discretionary spirit stones increases from thirty at five acres to ninety now!   The difference between thirty and ninety spirit stones per year is extremely significant.   In this way, Qi-refining mid-stage cultivators can control a much larger number of spirit stones compared to Qi-refining early-stage cultivators.   However, when advancing to the Qi-refining mid-stage, you need to report to someone from the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion before you can officially receive the additional two acres of spirit fields.   Fortunately, the connections Meng Guan had set up for He Song were still available.   Zhao Lin, who succeeded Meng Guan as the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, didn’t perish in the previous calamity.   And due to the sudden decrease in the number of loose cultivators in the Immortal City, the surviving cultivators were deeply touched. As a result, whenever they encountered someone they knew from the past, they would engage in a sentimental conversation..

Chapter 40: Chapter 40: Cooking in a Small Stove   Translator: 549690339   The relationship between He Song and Zhao Lin evolved over time.   From a wealth of emotions when they first met.   To familiarity as they got to know each other more.   And eventually, to deep friendship that had them wishing they had met sooner.   Over those three years, the bond between He Song and Zhao Lin tightened, their interactions became more frequent.   Now, the two could be considered good friends.   Although He Song had yet to introduce Zhao Lin to his mini social circle with Wei Fan and other friends, he was already making preparations to do so.   Zhao Lin was friendly with Meng Guan and has now established a decent rapport with He Song himself.   To include him in his group of friends was something that He Song had to consider.   Today,   After practicing his Spirit Rain Skill for a half-hour on his managed spirit field, He Song headed towards the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Now that his cultivation was stable, it was time to claim a few more acres of the spirit field.   After all, his annual income in the future would be much higher than during his early Qi Refining days.   Soon, He Song was seen at the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Inside the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion,   Zhao Lin was on duty.   Hence, when He Song showed up, Zhao Lin, who was initially busy reading some miscellaneous books, instantly stood up.   “Congratulations on breaking through to the mid-stage of Qi Refining, and your remarkable progress in cultivation. You are now closer to Foundation Establishment!” In the blink of an eye, Zhao Lin congratulated him enthusiastically.   Although he was at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining himself, he saw He Song as a good friend. So, naturally, he wanted to congratulate him on his breakthrough.   Meanwhile, several spirit amulets quickly appeared in Zhao Lin’s hands. “Come, come, these are a few Thick Earth Amulets that I have personally    drawn. They’re not expensive, I’m just offering them to congratulate you.” Handing over the Thick Earth Amulets to He Song, a flash of joy passed through Zhao Lin’s eyes.   The breakthrough of his friend strengthened Zhao Lin’s own footing in the Immortal Pavilion.   If anything were to happen in the future, it would definitely aid him to some extent.   Just like Meng Guan.   After making friends with him, he was assigned to manage the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, a position with significant benefits.   So, in Zhao Lin’s eyes, exchanging benefits with friends often had its own perks.   “Many thanks to you, Mr. Zhao. I happen to be in need of such life-saving spirit amulets. Your generosity is much appreciated.” He Song did not decline and took the Thick Earth Amulets offered.   These Thick Earth Amulets that could save his life in critical situations, He Song would take them even if he did not need them. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only  Besides, Zhao Lin himself was an amulet Tao master; the Thick Earth Amulets he made would only cost their production price.   He Song never forgot the close call he had three years ago. So, he was constantly working on bolstering his survival skills. Only then could he survive in the brutal Cultivation World.   All spirit stones he earned in the past three years went into inscribing array patterns. As a result, he only had a few left. Now that he has an income, he can always use more.   As for owing a favor… well, he owed it to a good friend, he could return the favor when the right time came.   The He Song who had successfully advanced to the Qi-refining mid-stage was no longer the same as before.   He could gather ninety spirit stones a year now. A few Thick Earth Amulets were not a big favor to repay.   “You must be here for those two acres of the spirit field right?” Zhao Lin asked, feeling satisfied when he observed He Song accepting the Thick Earth Amulets.   He clearly approved of He Song’s straightforwardness.   Just as He Song was about to nod,   Zhao Lin suddenly shook his head at him with a smile.   “I’m afraid you’re a bit late. As soon as you mentioned that you were going into seclusive cultivation to break through to the mid-stage of Qi refining, I have already assigned those two acres of spirit field under your name. So now, the location of the two acres of spirit field is right here.”   Zhao Lin, speaking and winding his way around the point, fetched a map from the side and pointed out the location to He Song.   In the large map of spirit fields outside the Immortal Pavilion, all spirit fields were marked with names of their owners.   A surprised He Song noticed his own name in a quick scan.    Two regions, one big and one small, marked “He Song”.   But the two regions were connected to each other. The black line connecting them signified that the smaller region was added later.   He Song quickly noticed that there were many faqadeades for whom multiple regions were marked on the map.   For instance, he saw a name, Chen Zhou, written at two different places. But before He Song got a chance to inquire,   Zhao Lin’s finger had already directed towards He Song’s name on the map.   “Look here, the big area that was originally yours is your five-acre spirit field. The small added area is the newly assigned two acres of spirit field. Both spirit fields are adjacent to each other, so it saves you from having to shuttle back and forth to cast the Spirit Rain Skill twice a day.”   He Song was initially taken aback to hear Zhao Lin’s explanation, but he quickly understood.   There probably weren’t many spiritual plant farmers like him, who could add a new spirit field next to their original one.   Other mid-stage Qi Refining spiritual plant farmers often had their newly added spirit fields in another location.   Just like Chen Zhou that He Song just saw, he had two regions with his name on it.   As a result, these cultivators had to visit two different spirit field areas every day and cast the Spirit Rain Skill twice.   Casting the Spirit Rain Skill twice a day, each time half an hour, and also traveling a long distance to the other spirit field, the whole process was time-consuming.   But what about He Song?   He Song only had to cast the Spirit Rain Skill once at his own spirit field location. Although the area was slightly larger, he didn’t need to travel around, and it only took half an hour.   Comparatively, cultivators like He Song, with his two spirit fields next to each other, definitely had it better than those who had to visit two separate spirit fields and cast the Spirit Rain Skill twice a day.   “I thank you, my friend!” He Song felt a warmth in his heart at Zhao Lin’s blatant preferential treatment and his impression of him also rose.   Zhao Lin not only assigned the additional two acres of spirit field to He Song when he went for his breakthrough, helping him to get his annual salary quicker,   But he also forcefully combined He Song’s two spirit fields together, allowing him to earn more without spending much time.   In doing so, it seemed like Zhao Lin had done everything he possibly could for He Song.   Whether it was the early assignment of the spirit field,   Or forcibly combining the two spirit fields together,   Both made He Song have a new understanding of Zhao Lin, and the power dynamics of the Cultivation World.   So, power in the Cultivation World could be used like this.   It turns out that Zhao Lin indeed had connections. If needs arise, he could genuinely make things easier for He Song.   “You don’t need to thank me. What’s the use of these words between us? It’s a small matter. As long as I am in this Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, I will handle everything perfectly for you.”   In response to He Song’s gratitude, Zhao Lin shook his hand nonchalantly, downplaying the favor as if it were not valuable.

Chapter 41: Chapter 41: Chen Zhou   Translator: 549690339   Others would definitely have to spend spirit stones to bribe him if they wanted him to handle these matters.   This was also one of the areas where he could make some profit as the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion manager.   But if it were his close friend, even if He Song hadn’t asked, he would have taken care of the matter as a matter of course.   Between people.   It’s different.   Ties of closeness and distance.   Interpersonal relationships.   Zhao Lin had always been good at this aspect.   Now, seeing He Song thanking him, he naturally didn’t think too much of this matter.   After confirming the location of his new spirit field, He Song stayed in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion for a while longer.   It wasn’t until someone came to handle some matters that He Song took his leave.   As the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, Zhao Lin had his duties today, and it wouldn’t be good to keep bothering him.   Leaving the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   He Song hesitated for a moment before quickly returning to his spirit field.   Earlier, He Song had only used the Spirit Rain Skill above his original five-acre spirit field and didn’t know that he had already gained two more acres of spirit field.   But now that he knew, He Song wouldn’t let those two acres go to waste.   Thankfully, the new spirit field was already planted with spirit rice, so He Song didn’t need to cultivate it again, just come over daily to use the Spirit Rain Skill.   Coming to the spirit field.   He Song quickly located the new two acres of spirit field based on his memory.   Immediately, he formed hand seals and used Spirit Rain Skill, and a rain cloud appeared quickly above the two-acre spirit field, covering the area.   Splash-   As the Spirit Rain Skill was unleashed, the fine rain fell from the sky, absorbing the surrounding spirit Qi while pouring it into the spirit field below. The spirit rice, now nourished by the spirit Qi, grew strong and lush, delighting the eyes.   However, just as He Song was using the Spirit Rain Skill to water the newly acquired two-acre spirit field.   A figure suddenly appeared in the distance and walked straight towards He Song’s side.   “Greetings, fellow daoist, my name is Chen Zhou. May I ask if you are the new owner of these two acres of spirit fields?” Chen Zhou looked frail and weak in his green robe, seemingly vulnerable to even a slight breeze.            He Song had noticed Chen Zhou, who was walking directly towards him, from a distance.   Though he appeared weak, it was evident that Chen Zhou had approached with a purpose.   He Song now had a feeling when he heard his words, and a thought flashed through his mind.   A glint appeared in his eyes, and he felt reassured.   The man was at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining, the same level as He Song.   At the same level, He Song might lack defensive means, but with the Thick Earth Amulets from Zhao Lin, he didn’t need to worry about Chen Zhou acting rashly.   Feeling secure, He Song relaxed a bit.   But despite his relaxed state, his alertness didn’t diminish in the slightest.   On the contrary, he had already pinched a Thick Earth Amulet in his sleeve with his fingers.   If anything went wrong, He Song could instantly activate the Thick Earth Amulet to protect himself.   “Yes, I am He Song, just recently entered the Qi-refining mid stage and obtained these two acres of spirit field. Do you have any issues?” He Song openly admitted in response to Chen Zhou’s question.   However, as he spoke, He Song couldn’t shake the feeling that Chen Zhou’s name sounded familiar.   As if he had seen him somewhere before.   After some thought, a look of surprise appeared in He Song’s eyes as he looked at Chen Zhou.   He remembered.   Earlier.   When he was at the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, he and Zhao Lin had been looking at the map together, and he had seen a name called Chen Zhou on the map.   At that time, He Song had been lamenting how people had to travel to two different locations and perform Spirit Rain Skill twice a day after breaking through to Qi-refining mid stage, which was quite troublesome.   And now, the person he had inadvertently seen had appeared right in front of him so quickly.   If he recalled correctly.   His initial attention to Chen Zhou was because the man’s spirit field was adjacent to his own.   In other words… those two newly acquired acres were probably forcefully taken from Chen Zhou by Zhao Lin and given to He Song.   Meanwhile, Chen Zhou’s new two acres of spirit field were arranged elsewhere.   One could say that Chen Zhou was the only victim in this entire situation.   This…   Thinking of this, He Song felt speechless and didn’t know what to say. He just stood in place, quietly casting the Spirit Rain Skill, waiting for Chen Zhou’s next words.   No wonder Chen Zhou came straight towards him upon seeing him.            No wonder Chen Zhou seemed to have been squatting here the whole time.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m   No wonder Chen Zhou asked if he was the new owner of these two acres of spirit field right away.   They had seized this man’s spirit field, and now the man had come to find him.   He Song felt a mix of emotions for a moment.   He didn’t expect.   To become a villain in someone else’s eyes.   “Fellow Daoist He, these two acres of spirit field used to belong to me. I dare to ask if I could exchange them with you. I have two acres at another location.” Chen Zhou bowed his hands to He Song, took out ten spirit stones from his pocket, and said.   The ten bright spirit stones were particularly dazzling under the sunlight.   He Song caught sight of them and almost had his gaze drawn away by the spirit stones.bender   However, just as Chen Zhou handed the ten spirit stones to He Song and finished speaking, He Song’s expression turned solemn.   While continuing with the hand seals, He Song shifted his body to the side.   Ten spirit stones weren’t a small amount.   It could rent a room in the Immortal Pavilion for a month.   But for a Qi-refining mid stage cultivator like He Song, ten spirit stones were pitifully few.   He just needed a year to get ninety spirit stones from the spirit fields he managed.   Furthermore, once he agreed to the exchange, he would have to run to two different locations every day to cast the Spirit Rain Skill twice.   This would significantly increase the time he spent managing the spirit fields.   Consequently, the time He Song could devote to cultivation would inevitably shorten.   To spend so much time for ten spirit stones, He Song thought it wasn’t worthwhile.   Apart from that, the spirit field division was given to him as a favor from Zhao   T .in   Was Zhao Lin’s effort only worth ten spirit stones?   If he knew He Song exchanged it for ten spirit stones, what would Zhao Lin think?   Now.   Chen Zhou wanted to exchange these two acres of spirit field with only ten spirit stones in front of him.   He Song couldn’t help but think that Chen Zhou was underestimating both him, a cultivator at the Qi-refining mid stage, and the price of Zhao Lin’s friendship.   “There’s no need for the spirit stones. If you want to exchange, just go find the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion manager. If he says it’s alright, I’ll do it.” In an instant, He Song’s expression turned cold, and he flatly refused.   After that, He Song didn’t forget to give a warning.   “I forgot to tell you, the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion is a close friend of mine. When you go, don’t forget to weigh your options..”            

Chapter 42: Chapter 42: Cultivator with Three No’s   Translator: 549690339   The words fell.   He Song’s figure had already walked to one side.   Although it was somewhat difficult to maintain the Spirit Rain Skill while moving, to avoid seeing Chen Zhou once more, He Song still carefully manipulated the Spirit Rain Skill and left Chen Zhou’s side.   Facing this kind of a cultivator who didn’t know right from wrong, He Song was cautious, but within the Immortal Pavilion, he wasn’t fearful. Chen Zhou was just a spiritual plant farmer at the fourth- tier of Qi Refining.   His cultivation level was similar to He Song’s.   Even if ambushed, as long as He Song remained vigilant, he could not be caught off-guard.   At the same time, Chen Zhou seemed to have no connections or background.   Otherwise, he would not have easily let Zhao Lin take away two acres of his spirit field and transfer them to He Song.   Moreover, when his own spirit field was suddenly taken away, he did not cause trouble for Zhao Lin, but sought He Song to exchange with him, proving that this man had a bully the weak and fear the strong character.   No background.   No threat.   No courage.   Facing such a cultivator, He Song couldn’t find any reason to fear him.   Thinking this way in his heart, He Song quickly decided to return to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion later and ask Zhao Lin to investigate Chen Zhou’s background.   If there was nothing to find, all the better.   But if Chen Zhou truly had something hidden, He Song might have to ask others to take care of this trouble for him.   “You…”   Chen Zhou flushed red at these words, pointing at He Song and wanting to say something, but after a tremble of his lips, ultimately said nothing.   Stamping his foot, seeing He Song concentrating on the Spirit Rain Skill and not paying attention to him, Chen Zhou dawdled for a while before finally leavmg In trustratlon.   He Song’s cold refusal.   And his friend who managed the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Although Chen Zhou was angry, he did not dare to continue to pester him. The manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion was a powerful figure, and compared to him, a small spiritual plant farmer, they were as different as heaven and earth.   He simply could not afford to provoke them.   He couldn’t provoke the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   And he couldn’t provoke He Song, the manager’s good friend, either.   So he had no choice but to leave.   However, as he walked away, He Song faintly heard voices muttering things like “overbearing”, “committing many evils”, “exploiting fellow villagers”, and “borrowing a tiger’s might.”   He Song didn’t care about these comments, but he kept his eyes on Chen Zhou and quietly noted the direction he took as he left.   Soon.   He Song completely irrigated the two acres of spirit field that had been newly transferred to his name.    Instead of continuing to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, He Song followed the direction in which Chen Zhou had left, walking leisurely.   Unfortunately, after walking quite a distance, He Song was unable to find out where Chen Zhou lived.   With no other choice, He Song had to return home.   But upon returning home, He Song picked up a piece of paper.   “Brother Zhao, I encountered a man named Chen Zhou in the spirit field today, who is at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining.”   “He offered ten spirit stones, claiming that the two acres of spirit field belonged to him before, and wanted to exchange spirit fields with me. I refused, and then he left sullenly.”   “I hope Brother Zhao can help me investigate this person’s background since my cultivation level is low, and I fear retaliation.” “If anything is amiss, please let me know.”   “He Song.”   Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Zhao Lin quickly received the sound -transmitting paper crane sent by He Song.   After reading the paper carefully, Zhao Lin frowned and destroyed it.   He couldn’t help but feel a surge of anger in his heart.   Cursing inwardly.   “I finally helped a friend out with something, and now this Chen Zhou is just causing trouble.”   After doing a favor for He Song, Zhao Lin now received a sound-transmitting paper crane asking him to help investigate Chen Zhou’s background in case of retaliation.   This…   Isn’t this a slap in my own face?   I helped a friend with great difficulty, and although the task was completed, the aftermath was not cleaned up properly.   I even reassured myself back then that everything was fine.bender   Thinking about the words He Song said when he came, Zhao Lin felt extremely embarrassed at this moment.   How could he hold his head up in front of his friends in the future?   Thinking of these things, Zhao Lin’s gaze gradually turned hostile.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m   Then, he took out a thick book and flipped through it quickly.   After a long period.   Zhao Lin finally raised his head, his heart slightly tense.   “Chen Zhou, cultivation at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining, Loose cultivator background, age 31.”   “Three years ago, he was recruited to join the Immortal Pavilion as a spiritual plant farmer, and has been so until today.”   Found him.   Chen Zhou was recruited to join the Immortal Pavilion three years ago.   Three years ago…   With a flash of reminiscence in his eyes, Zhao Lin’s gaze quickly became obscure and unclear.   When exactly was three years ago?    Three years ago was when Master Cheng Shan left the Immortal Pavilion, followed by the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion being attacked by the Evil Cultivator!   Since then, the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion has become more relaxed in recruiting spiritual plant farmers.   That’s because many spiritual plant farmers died in that catastrophe, leaving the spirit fields unattended. Thus, the higher-ups of the Immortal Pavilion were eager to recruit more farmers to fill the vacancies.   That was when Zhao Lin, who had responsibilities, recruited one Loose cultivator after another.   This Chen Zhou must have been recruited by him at that time as well.   Caution flashed in Zhao Lin’s eyes.   Loose cultivator.   Loose cultivator background.   He was able to cultivate to the Qi-refining mid stage before joining the Immortal Pavilion.   This Chen Zhou must have something extraordinary!   It is extremely difficult to successfully pass through the most vulnerable Qi Refining Early Stage in the highly mortal Loose cultivator group and break through to the Qi-refining mid stage.   Nonetheless, Chen Zhou still managed to break through.   From this, it can be inferred that Chen Zhou must be more than what he appears to be on the surface.   With this in mind, a piece of paper quickly appeared in Zhao Lin’s hand.   “Chen Zhou, cultivation at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining, Loose cultivator background, age 31.”   “Three years ago, he was recruited to join the Immortal Pavilion as a spiritual plant farmer, and has been so until today.”   “I could only find this much information. However, according to my speculation, this Chen Zhou, who successfully broke through to the Qi-refining mid stage as a Loose cultivator, might not be as simple as he seems on the surface.”   “Be careful, my friend. I sincerely apologize for causing this trouble for you. If there’s anything I can help with, I will not shirk my responsibilities.”   “I hope you won’t blame me.”   “Zhao Lin.”   Quickly.   He Song, who was cultivating at home, received Zhao Lin’s sound-transmitting paper crane.   Scanning the words on the paper, He Song’s brow furrowed gradually.   He joined the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion three years ago, becoming a spiritual plant farmer.   But before joining the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, this Chen Zhou was already a fourth-tier Qi Refining cultivator.   That is to say, Zhao Lin’s speculation is not baseless; on the contrary, his guess   However, what about the Chen Zhou he confronted previously?   One, he had no background.   Two, he had no threat.   Three, he had no courage and wisdom.   How would he explain the Chen Zhou he had seen?   If He Song remembered correctly,   Chen Zhou was very submissive in front of him, not even daring to say any harsh words when leaving.   He only dared to mutter words like ‘bullying and domineering’ and ‘pretending to be a tiger’ after walking far away..

Chapter 43: Chapter 43: I can’t stay in this house anymore.   Translator: 549690339   Is this really something a wandering cultivator who broke through to the Qi-Refining mid stage could do?   If it were in a wandering cultivator’s nature, they might have started threatening me even before I could refuse their offer, right?   Or perhaps, right when I refuse the offer, they would just coldly throw a remark and then leave?   Imagining the wandering cultivator’s reaction in that scenario.   He Song frowned.   Recalling the demeanor and actions of Chen Zhou, He Song’s eyebrows twitched.   He couldn’t be sure whether Chen Zhou was acting then or not.   Having lived in the era of information explosion, He Song was well aware that some people are naturally gifted actors.   Such people do not act according to their hearts but are more about putting on a facade. They are usually submissive in public, while utterly ruthless in private.bender   If the Chen Zhou he encountered was like this, then perhaps the other party was already plotting how to get rid of him in their heart.   In other words.   He Song’s situation is very dangerous!   How about being a good friend of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion’s manager?   After dying, won’t he still be a corpse anyways?   Considering Chen Zhou’s origin as a wandering cultivator, he must be no stranger to killing secretly.   High mortality among wandering cultivators isn’t solely because their livelihoods are dangerous.   More so, it is due to the killings between wandering cultivators themselves.   Killing others.   For wandering cultivators, there is not much burden.   Furthermore, He Song had already offended Chen Zhou explicitly.   If He Song were in the other person’s position, he’d also choose to strike first when someone has thoroughly offended him.   With these thoughts in mind, He Song felt goosebumps on his scalp and a sudden cold shiver on his back.   As the ominous feeling in his heart grew stronger, He Song maintained his composure.   But he decided it was best to suspend his cultivation for now.   He got up, his fingers gripping a Thick Earth Amulet to ensure his safety at the moment.   Only then did he open the door.   He walked towards the outside.   This place is not safe anymore!    He could track Chen Zhou by following the route he took when he left.   Would he be hiding in the shadows, observing him and then following him to find out where he lives?   Facing a wandering cultivator who survives by licking blood off the knife’s blade, He Song, who is a cultivator from an Immortal Pavilion, might not be able to withstand them.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com   With these thoughts, the pace of He Song’s footsteps quickened.   Upon reaching the busy street outside, He Song’s mood finally calmed down a bit.   However, he did not relax his grip on the Thick Earth Amulet, keeping it ready to be activated at any moment.   Walking down the street.   Without hesitation, He Song headed towards Wei Fan’s house.   He was not alone.   Having painstakingly operated in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion for so many years, He Song had backers and connections within the Immortal Pavilion.   In the face of danger at this moment.   Since he had no ability to resolve it at the moment.   He had no choice but to seek the help of his backers.   He Song was not one of those who stubbornly insists on sticking to his principles and suffers as a result.   Not seeking help from his backers when he had them, and instead insisting on solving it alone.   That was too dangerous, and a single slip might lead to a total loss.   He was different from others; others may die and be good as new after eighteen years, but He Song was an everlasting being. If he were to die, he might end up regretting it with all his heart.   So in He Song’s mind.   The best way was to not offend anyone if possible, but if one had to, one must kill them in a single strike.   If he had no choice but to take matters into his own hands, he’d reduce his enemies to ashes, not giving them a chance to rise again.   If he could eliminate all future problems, then he must do so.   In short, he could not leave any future troubles for himself.   For his life was precious.   Quickly,   He Song arrived at Wei Fan’s house.   Wei Fan had a day off today and was not on duty at the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Seeing He Song, Wei Fan was overjoyed and personally invited him in.   Together, they went to the pavilion where they used to drink tea together.   As the two sat facing each other in the pavilion, Wei Fan started the conversation.   “Friend, it’s been a long time since you’ve come here. I’m quite bored living in this courtyard alone.” Wei Fan handed a cup of tea to He Song and shook his head.    Ever since He Song moved away from here three years ago, he had been living a dull life again.   He still missed the times when He Song was around.   Although the outside world was more dangerous back then,   He had He Song to live with, and they got along well. Moreover, they were able to enjoy drinks during their leisure time.   Unfortunately, not long after He Song moved away three years ago, Wei Fan lost that feeling.   Today, with He Song visiting, he naturally had to reminisce a bit.   “Wei, I came here today to ask for your help to save my life.” He Song accepted the tea and took a sip, a hint of helplessness in his eyes.   Every time they met during their monthly gatherings over the past three years, Wei Fan would invite him to live here again.   But He Song had never agreed.   Now, he had to visit again, and Wei Fan still brought it up. It made him feel a little embarrassed to refuse.   However, he had important matters to discuss today, so he thought it would be best to first explain the situation to Wei Fan, see if he could help, and make decisions accordingly.   “Oh? Save your life? You’re so cautious and never malicious towards others. Are there actually cultivators trying to bully you?”   Hearing He Song’s words, Wei Fan was shocked. A glint appeared in his eyes, but after looking for a while, he couldn’t see any signs of He Song having limbs missing.   Seeing this, he couldn’t help but direct his questioning gaze at He Song.   At the same time, a touch of anger surfaced in Wei Fan’s heart.   He Song was his good friend.   Furthermore, He Song was usually cautious and never deliberately offended anyone.   If He Song was bullied within the Immortal Pavilion, where would Wei Fan, a Qi-Refining late-stage cultivator, place his face?   For a moment, Wei Fan’s blood began to boil.   Could it be that today, he, a Qi-Refining late-stage cultivator who had never fought before, would have to take action?   As his emotions surged, the spiritual pressure unique to the Qi-refining late stage fluctuated slightly.   This fluctuation was caused by the intense emotional turbulence affecting the spirit power within his body.   A slight fluctuation in the spiritual pressure of Qi-Refining late stage was not unbearable for He Song, who was at the Qi-Refining mid stage.   On the contrary, He Song seemed to feel a gentle breeze and warmth in his heart at this moment.   “Well, it’s not exactly that. This matter is actually partly my fault, but since things have already gotten out of hand, I can only seek your help now.” He Song carefully weighed his words and quickly explained the events he had encountered to Wei Fan.   Starting from when he broke through to the Qi-refining mid stage.   Then, going to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion to find Zhao Lin, who casually drew two acres of spirit field for him.   Later, meeting Chen Zhou at the spirit field, who offered to exchange with ten spirit stones.   Subsequently, entrusting Zhao Lin to investigate Chen Zhou’s background and receiving the truth along with his specula tion in a paper crane.   In the end, due to concerns about Chen Zhou’s identity as a wandering cultivator, He Song had no choice but to come here to seek help from Wei Fan. After explaining everything, He Song took a sip of his tea to moisten his   throat..

Chapter 44: Chapter 44: Astonishingly Bold   Translator: 549690339   On the side.   After listening for a while, Wei Fan, who finally understood the whole situation, had a gradually strange expression on his face.   He pointed at He Song in front of him.   Then he pointed towards the direction of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion. After going back and forth several times,   Wei Fan, with an expression as if he was being teased, finally understood the ins and outs of the whole matter.   “I was just wondering how could you, being so cautious usually, suddenly offend someone? It turns out that your friend did an ill-favored favor, making you offend Chen Zhou.”   Unable to restrain his laughter, Wei Fan continued speaking, but the amusement in his eyes could not be hidden.   Anyone would be dumbfounded by this kind of unwarranted disaster.   Chen Zhou suddenly had his spirit field taken away, and now has to travel to two different places every day to use the Spirit Rain Skill, wasting much more time than before.   However, since the spirit field was kindly given to He Song by his friend, it was impossible to return it to Chen Zhou.   Both sides had their own difficulties, making it impossible to return to the way things were.   In this way, the grudge between He Song and Chen Zhou was completely solidified.   One was a fourth- tier of Qi Refining loose cultivator.   The other was a fourth-tier of Qi Refining Immortal Pavilion cultivator.   It was clear at a glance who was stronger.   And He Song, who was well aware of his own limitations and knew he couldn’t defeat his opponent, had come to seek help to deal with this trouble.bender   The fighting power of an Immortal Pavilion cultivator was indeed unmatched by a loose cultivator.   If Chen Zhou really wanted revenge, He Song could only be on guard all the time.   However, there is no such thing as a constant precaution against a thief.   If He Song were to be caught off guard,   He might even lose his life.   Considering He Song’s cautious nature, he wouldn’t give Chen Zhou such an opportunity.   Even if he didn’t want to, he would probably have to strike first.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com   After understanding this, the look in Wei Fan’s eyes when he looked at He Song suddenly appeared a bit mocking.   “Although it’s an unwarranted disaster, since you’ve come to me, you must have a plan. Why don’t you tell me? As long as it’s feasible, I can help.”   Once Wei Fan knew that He Song was not in any immediate danger, he became more relaxed.    He handed He Song a cup of tea.   Wei Fan’s eyes flickered.   With his many years of understanding of his good friend, he could even guess what He Song was going to say next.   However, he still wanted to hear it from He Song’s mouth.   After all, this was the first time He Song had sought help from him.   Tnree years ago, It was wel ran wno naa maae tne proposal, ana He song not bring it up.   “I would like to ask Brother Wei to investigate. If Chen Zhou has no intention of taking revenge and is weak in usual days, then let it go. If he does… I’ll have to rely on Brother Wei.”   “When the time comes, I will have my friend in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion remove his name from the list of spiritual plant farmers, making him a loose cultivator once again. It won’t be too late for Brother Wei to take action then.”   After taking the teacup from Wei Fan, He Song put it down and without any hesitation, he told Wei Fan what he had in mind.   Up until now, He Song was still unsure whether Chen Zhou was genuinely pretending or if he was truly weak.   That’s why he had to ask Wei Fan to investigate.   If Chen Zhou was really as weak as He Song had seen and had no intentions of revenge, then sparing his life wouldn’t be an issue.   However, if Chen Zhou was not weak during their usual encounters and his weakness was feigned, or if he had intentions of revenge, then He Song would have no choice but to ask Wei Fan to take the initiative.   At the same time, if they were to take action, He Song would ask Zhao Lin for help and remove Chen Zhou’s name from the list of spiritual plant farmers.   Then, Chen Zhou would no longer be an internal cultivator of Immortal Pavilion, but a loose cultivator.   Killing amongst cultivators within the Immortal Pavilion was strictly forbidden.   If caught, the offenders would have their cultivation base removed and be thrown out of Immortal Pavilion.   However, if a cultivator from the Immortal Pavilion killed a loose cultivator, as long as it was not within Immortal Pavilion, no one would pursue the matter. Even if the law enforcement team knew you did it, they wouldn’t care.   In the Cultivation World, it is the law of the jungle.   The Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team only ensures the safety within the Immortal Pavilion and the killing among the cultivators inside. They don’t care about the loose cultivators who die in large numbers.   Nor will anyone else care.   Every year, countless loose cultivators die in the outside world, and nobody cares about one or two more.   Before coming here, He Song had already thought of everything.   Now, all he needed to do was to wait for Wei Fan’s probing results before they could take action.   “Ah, fellow Daoist, you are too cautious. If it were me, Chen Zhou would have been slapped to death the moment I noticed something wrong.” Wei Fan obviously disagreed with He Song’s response.   Originally, he thought He Song would let him take action directly and kill the man named Chen Zhou with one palm.   Only in this way could it be called decisive and swift.   However, he didn’t expect He Song to ask him to investigate first, and then decide according to the situation.    Even when taking action, he needed He Song’s other friend to remove Chen Zhou’s name from the spiritual plant farmers before he could make a move.   This… was too troublesome.   Although this could minimize the possibility of killing the wrong person and the hidden dangers after killing, it seemed too cautious.   But after thinking about it, Wei Fan let it go.   Isn’t this just the way his friend is?   If He Song weren’t cautious, he wouldn’t be himself.   “Fellow Daoist, please wait in my courtyard for a moment. I’ll go to the Spirit Construction Pavilion first to check where Chen Zhou lives. After that, I’ll investigate and you can wait for my return.”   As he spoke, Wei Fan had already stood up, ready to leave, but soon he stopped again.   He turned his head to look at He Song.   After thinking for a moment, Wei Fan still handed He Song several Defense Spirit Amulets.   “Take these spirit amulets for now, my friend. I’m worried that Chen Zhou might be bold enough to come looking for you.”   Only after He Song took the spirit amulets did Wei Fan feel relieved and leave.   In the small courtyard’s loft.   Watching Wei Fan’s departing figure.   Looking at the Defense Spirit Amulets in his hand, He Song shook his head helplessly.   He immediately recognized that these amulets were the ones Wei Fan had bought for himself to protect his body three years ago.   However, he didn’t expect that they would not be used back then.   Now, these amulets had unexpectedly ended up in his hands.   Shaking his head, He Song decided to return the amulets to Wei Fan after his return.   These amulets were high-level ones, and only a Qi-refining late stage cultivator like Wei Fan could truly unleash their power. If they were used for himself, it would be wasteful.   Spirit Construction Pavilion.   After leaving his small courtyard, Wei Fan quickly went to the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Ignoring the respectful salutes of the cultivators around him.   Wei Fan went straight to the ledger used by the Spirit Construction Pavilion to record the residences of the cultivators within the Immortal Pavilion.   Holding the ledger, Wei Fan went up to the second floor and his gaze quickly scanned through it.   “He Song, currently residing at No. 13 House, Piercing Cloud Street, in the Second District of the Immortal Pavilion’s outer ring.”   “Su Jin, currently residing at No. 31 House, Mountains Street, in the First District of the Immortal Pavilion’s outer ring.”   “Chen Zhou, currently residing at No. 7 House, Ink Street, in Ding District of the Immortal Pavilion’s outer ring.”   As his gaze swept over the names and residences, Wei Fan’s eyes quickly stopped on the name Chen Zhou.   “Chen Zhou, No. 7 House, Ink Street, Ding District..”

Chapter 45: Chapter 45: Loose Cultivators’ Path   Translator: 549690339   A while later.   In Wei Fan’s courtyard.   He Song stayed in Wei Fan’s house for an hour before he saw Wei Fan return from a distance.   After ushering in Wei Fan, who had returned from his investigation, He Song deliberately poured him a cup of tea and sat beside him, waiting for Wei Fan to speak.   Picking up the cup of tea He Song had specially poured for him.   Wei Fan drank it in one gulp, and only then did his furrowed brows relax. After taking a long sigh, he finally spoke.   “Phew, fellow Daoist, you can inform your good friend working at the Spiritual   Medicine Pavilion to remove Chen Zhou’s name from the spiritual plant farmer position.” Wei Fan’s eyes flashed with anger, then he continued.   “Chen Zhou is not as gentle as you saw him. He often relies on his Qi-refining mid-stage cultivation and bullies Qi Refining Early Stage cultivators, extorts spirit stones, and since no one has died yet, the Law Enforcement Team cannot do anything about it.”   “The people of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion are blind to have recruited such a person as a spiritual plant farmer. I don’t know what the person who recruited him into the Immortal Pavilion was thinking. Such a reputation among Loose cultivators is disgraceful.”   “In addition, when I went to investigate earlier, Chen Zhou was secretly inquiring about your information. It seems that he has ill intentions. So, I didn’t continue the investigation and returned directly.”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m   “Let’s do as you said, remove his title of spiritual plant farmer first, then force him to leave the Immortal Pavilion. At that time, I will take action.” Wei Fan put down his teacup, his face showing a touch of gloom.   He spoke lightly of the matter.   However, during his investigation, he discovered that Chen Zhou had brought all the bad habits of Loose cultivators into the Immortal Pavilion, making the surroundings of his living area smoky and chaotic.   Loose cultivators, due to a lack of restraint in the outside world, naturally have warped personalities.   Killing for treasures, extortion, and bullying the weak are things they are adept at.   Among Loose cultivators, such behavior is very common. Only those with inherently pure natures don’t care about these matters.   However, Loose cultivators with pure natures don’t last long in this circle unless they have extraordinary luck.   What about Chen Zhou?   He was originally a Loose cultivator, but with his Qi-refining mid-stage cultivation, he joined the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and became a spiritual plant farmer.   If he had joined the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and obeyed the rules of the Immortal Pavilion, being law-abiding and keeping a low profile, it would be acceptable.   But he didn’t.   He brought everything he learned as a Loose cultivator into the Immortal Pavilion.   He even exploited loopholes in the Immortal Pavilion’s laws, bullying the weak and extorting others.    This made the originally peaceful atmosphere in the Immortal Pavilion smoky and chaotic.   So when Wei Fan, who had qrown up in the Thick Earth Mansion and lived in   the Immortal Pavilion all this time, saw all this, he was immediately enraged.   These corrupt behaviors of Loose cultivators could be ignored outside the Immortal Pavilion, and he could pretend not to see them.   But Chen Zhou brought this all into the Immortal Pavilion, tarnishing the “pure land” in Wei Fan’s heart.   Therefore, the extent of Wei Fan’s anger can be imagined.   He had grown up in the Thick Earth Mansion and was nurtured as an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   It wasn’t until his cultivation was deemed too low that he was demoted to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, becoming the Steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   He had always lived in a relatively stable environment.   His understanding of Loose cultivators also stemmed mainly from books.   Even so, he had been rather disdainful of Loose cultivators before.   But it wasn’t until today.   When Chen Zhou’s behavior appeared in front of him, he saw the true nature of Loose cultivators for the first time.   “Alright, I’ll inform him right away.” After listening to Wei Fan’s description, He Song felt both relieved and a little afraid.   Fortunately, he had been cautious enough.   If not, he would probably still be clueless when Chen Zhou comes looking for him one night.   He was glad that he had asked Zhao Lin to investigate Chen Zhou’s background.   After sensing something was off, he immediately went to Wei Fan’s place.   If there had been any mistakes in these steps, he would have been constantly targeted by Chen Zhou in the future and unable to live in peace.   At the same time, He Song reminded himself not to judge people by their appearances in the future.   Even if they appear humble and polite in front of him, like a refined gentleman, he must find out their background, especially those who have offended him.   Take this time with Chen Zhou, for example.   In front of him, Chen Zhou was very submissive.   But who would have thought that when facing other cultivators with lower cultivation levels, he would be a bully, committing all sorts of nefarious deeds and extorting spirit stones.   Only because his own cultivation was at the Qi-refining mid-stage and he had Zhao Lin from the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion as his backer, that Chen Zhou didn’t turn against him on the spot.   If he were weaker or if Zhao Lin were not a manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, his situation would have been different.   Moreover, while not completely breaking ties with him at the time, he still secretly inquired about his information.    The intentions of Chen Zhou can be easily guessed.   He Song exhaled deeply, and with a flick of his fingers, a blank piece of paper appeared in his hand.   “Brother Zhao, that Chen Zhou has a perverse personality, bullies weaker fellows, extorts spirit stones, and engages in all sorts of evil deeds. His crimes are extremely heinous. I have asked my good friend to help me verify this.”   “I originally intended to deal with him directly, but the Immortal Pavilion prohibits infighting, so we have to abide.”   “Therefore, I can only ask my fellow Daoist to remove his name from the spiritual plant farmer list and force him to leave the Immortal Pavilion. After that, we’ll plan the next step.”   “This matter is of great importance, related to my safety and life. I hope my fellow Daoist can help.”   “He Song.”   As his fingers constantly moved, strands of spirit power were released, and soon several lines of writing appeared on the paper.   However, just as He Song was about to fold it into a paper crane and release it with the Sound Transmission Skill, Wei Fan from the side shook his head and signaled for He Song to wait.   “Allow me to add a few words.”   Saying this, Wei Fan’s fingers were already exuding spiritual power, and he left a name along with his own aura on the paper.   “Wei Fan.”   Seeing this, He Song nodded and did not stop him.   This was good news.   With the aura of Wei Fan, who was at the Qi-refining late stage, Zhao Lin would understand immediately upon receiving the sound-transmitting paper crane.   He Song had already asked a cultivator at the Qi-refining late stage to deal with Chen Zhou.   As He Song’s good friend,   he would do He Song a favor and remove Chen Zhou’s name from the list of spiritual plant farmers, knowing that He Song was well-prepared. It was a trivial matter.   In this way, Zhao Lin didn’t have to worry about Chen Zhou causing trouble in the future.   A cultivator at the Qi-refining late stage would deal with Chen Zhou, who was at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining.   Chen Zhou would certainly perish without a doubt.   Wei Fan left his name and aura on the paper because of this reason.   He didn’t know the extent of the relationship between He Song and Zhao Lin, but if his name and aura were on the paper, Zhao Lin would be more likely to help.   That was all.   He Song released the sound-transmitting paper crane.   He Song and Wei Fan waited for a moment.   Soon.   A sound-transmitting paper crane quickly came speeding from a distance..bender

Chapter 46: Chapter 46: Crushing Bones and Scattering Ashes   Translator: 549690339   In the blink of an eye, it landed right in front of He Song.   Releasing a hint of his own aura, the sound-transmitting paper crane in front of He Song turned instantly into a piece of white paper.   He unfolded it.   “Fellow Daoist, this matter started because of me, and your aftermath is my part.”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m   “I thought it would be okay to deal with it later, but I didn’t expect you to have already found out about Chen Zhou’s details.”   “That Chen Zhou is ill-tempered, bullying the weak and extorting spirit stones on weekdays. He is nothing but evil, a great sinner, and absolutely a harmful horse to the team.”   “Your uncovering is indeed a great achievement.”   “I have removed Chen Zhou’s name from the spiritual plant farmers and made a plea for you.”   “With this merit, you should be rewarded by the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, and the reward will be personally delivered by me.”   “Zhao Lin.”   In his letter, Zhao Lin didn’t mention why he wants benefits for He Song, or that He Song wants to deal with Chen Zhou.   Instead, having removed Chen Zhou’s name from the spiritual plant farmers, and saying that Chen Zhou is unforgivably guilty, he would make a plea to He Song once Chen’s guilt was revealed.   This operation was simply classic.   After reading it, He Song couldn’t help but smile.   Even Wei Fan, who was angrily reacting to Chen Zhou’s actions, looked strange when he accidentally glanced at it.   This Zhao Lin.   As long as it is within his authority, he dares to seek benefits for his friends.   “This Daoist is indeed an interesting person.”   Wei Fan looked strangely appreciative, speaking in a soft voice.   He also once wanted to help He Song save some spirit stones, relying on his own position to provide He Song with benefits. But he never thought.   Zhao Lin did even more excessively than him.   He only exempted He Song from nearly half a month’s rent.   Zhao Lin on the other hand.   Not only helped He Song handle the spirit field affairs, but also provided cover for He Song when he wanted to kill someone, and even pleaded for him.   This…   It was obvious that there was a conflict between the two sides, and one side wanted to eliminate the root cause to avoid future troubles.            In Zhao Lin’s place, it turned into He Song’s wise and clear eyes, detecting that Chen Zhou’s character was extremely bad, and cleaning the tumor for the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   If it weren’t for the fact that he was involved in this incident, Wei Fan might have believed Zhao Lin’s words.   “This Daoist friend has known me for more than three years, and is a network that Lao Meng entrusted me with before he left. When Lao Meng returns, perhaps we can add him to our gathering and have one more person.”   Seeing Wei Fan’s interest in Zhao Lin, He Song, who had long considered Zhao Lin a part of his circle, quickly explained.   A person, if he is a friend with any one of three people, can confirm his character.   If he is friends with two of the three people, there will be no obstacle to joining the small circle.   He Song, Wei Fan, Meng Guan.   The three of them have known each other for many years and understand each other’s temperament.   People recognized by two of them will naturally not have character problems.   “However, speaking of Lao Meng, has Lao Meng passed you a paper crane message recently?” Halfway through, He Song thought of Meng Guan, and hurriedly asked another question.   He Song hadn’t seen Meng Guan for a long time.   Three years ago, Meng Guan sent He Song and Wei Fan a sound-transmitting paper crane each, and then there was no more news until now.   He Song and Wei Fan tried to contact him, but there was always no response to their sound-transmitting paper cranes.   The two were desperate but could do nothing.   The Red Spirit Gold Mine was too dangerous, and they didn’t dare to go and investigate with their current abilities.   They could only worry in their hearts.bender   “Let’s discuss adding new people to the group after Lao Meng returns, and Lao   Meng hasn’t given me any sound-transmitting paper cranes either. But wait, I’ll let those below chase Chen Zhou out of the Immortal Pavilion.” Shaking his head, Wei Fan said, and then released a sound-transmitting paper crane.   He, Wei Fan, is not a powerless person.   As a steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion and a Qi-refining late stage cultivator, his power is enormous.   The Spirit Construction Pavilion is established to manage all buildings in the Immortal Pavilion.   Being a steward in such a real authority department, driving a loose cultivator out of the Immortal Pavilion is just a matter of a word for him.   Now.   Since Chen Zhou has been removed from the spiritual plant farmers by Zhao Lin, it means he is now a loose cultivator.   The simplest way to deal with a loose cultivator is to drive him out of the Immortal Pavilion and then kill him with one hit.   As a late stage Qi-refiner, Wei Fan, who drastically enhanced his battle capacity three years ago, had an easy time dealing with a fourth-tier Qi-refining practitioner.   Chen Zhou may be a loose cultivator, but he is only a Qi-refining mid stage practitioner who has just broken through the fourth tier.   In the face of a late Qi Refining stage cultivator with finely tuned Artifacts, abundant spirit amulets, and proficient spells, there is almost no resistance.            “Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment while I fetch the scoundrel’s head.” After releasing the sound-transmitting paper crane, Wei Fan smiled slightly at He Song and quickly rushed out of the small courtyard.   Looking at his excited spirit, it seemed that he hadn’t taken any action for a long time and was a bit restless.   However, just as he was about to step out of the yard.   The voice of He Song sounded behind him.   “Wei friends, we don’t need the head, remember to burn it to ashes afterwards!”   Wei Fan’s figure visibly paused, then rushed out towards the courtyard at an even faster speed.   At the same time, a voice followed.   “Alright, I’ll bring you some ashes when I’m done burning.”   So, Wei Fan’s figure disappeared into the courtyard, heading towards the position where Chen Zhou’s house was.   Within the small courtyard.   Watching Wei Fan’s figure disappear from his sight, He Song was speechless in his heart, but after thinking about it, he didn’t refuse. Burn the body after killing, and crush and scatter the ashes.   This should no longer bring any troubles.   Even if Chen Zhou has friends outside, they probably can’t track him down.   In addition, burning the body and scattering the ashes could also prevent Chen Zhou from playing dead or feigning death and escaping.   Even if he really dies, he won’t become a zombie monster.   The body was burned and the bones were crushed and scattered, everything would dissipate.   Chen Zhou will completely disappear from this world.   After thinking about it, He Song forcibly resisted the idea of going with Wei Fan to destroy the corpse and eliminate his traces.   Outside the Immortal Pavilion, the situation was still too dangerous for He Song at the moment.   His cultivation had reached the Qi-refining mid stage, and he had not learned any offensive or defensive skills, his magic-fighting ability was almost zero.   Under such circumstances, if he encountered an enemy, he would probably have to hide behind Wei Fan.   This is not what He Song wanted.   “Wait until I’ve learned some offensive and defensive skills, then pair them with offensive and defensive Artifacts, prepare some high-grade spirit amulets, and then leave the Immortal Pavilion.”   In Wei Fan’s small courtyard, He Song was silently considering the things he needed to prepare.   At this point, He Song’s cultivation has reached the Qi-refining mid stage, and he will have at least ninety spirit stones a year.   This is much richer than the Qi Refining Early Stage.   As long as some time was saved, He Song felt that the things he had just thought about could certainly be gathered.   After all, the thing about time.   He never lacked it..            

Chapter 47: Chapter 47: Destroying the Corpse and Erasing Traces   Translator: 549690339   With this in mind, He Song quickly began planning the future use of his spirit stones.   First of all.   Skills!   Skills are cheap – a common Qi Refining skill only costs ten spirit stones.   Although special skills for the Qi Refining stage are slightly more expensive, they should not be too costly.   He probably wouldn’t have to spend many spirit stones to learn all the skills he would like to learn.   This is the easiest way to increase one’s strength.   Moreover, there are many Qi Refining skills that have various unique applications and can greatly contribute to other aspects of one’s abilities.   For example, the Spirit Vision Skill, Sound Transmission Skill, or Breath   Concealment Formulas are just like this.   Of course, practicing skills takes a long time.   But He Song has a stronger soul than ordinary cultivators, as he came from another world, and his learning speed for skills is also much faster than ordinary cultivators.   It would be a waste not to take advantage of this great asset.   Aside from that.   There are spirit amulets!   The spirit amulets play a significant role during the Qi Refining stage.   A low-quality Thick Earth Amulet that costs five spirit stones can resist attacks from the Qi Refining Early Stage several times, as well as some offensive power from the Qi Refining Mid Stage.   A mid-quality Thick Earth Amulet costing twenty spirit stones could resist several Qi Refining Mid Stage attacks and some offensive power from the Qi Refining Late Stage.   A low-quality Golden Light Amulet costing five spirit stones has incredible lethality. If there is no Defense Spirit Amulet or Artifacts to guard against it, a Qi Refining Early Stage cultivator will not be able to take it without suffering.   However, the duration of these spirit amulets is generally short, often lasting only about ten breaths.   As the duration is short, the price is relatively high.   Ordinary cultivators usually carry a few, and more cautious ones may bring ten or more for self-defense.   But during the Qi Refining stage, it is never wrong to carry extra spirit amulets with you.   This is also why many cultivators choose to dabble as an amulet Tao master.   Creating your own amulets is more cost-effective once you become proficient, and selling unwanted amulets can help supplement household expenses. Amulet Tao masters tend to make a decent amount of money.   Aside from skills and spirit amulets, there are Artifacts.    Low-quality Artifacts can be purchased at the Artifacts Pavilion in Immortal Pavilion, with prices fluctuating around 100 spirit stones depending on factors such as newness and style.   Mid-quality Artifacts are more expensive, usually priced around 500 spirit stones.   In the Cultivation World.   Generally, Qi Refining Early and Mid Stage cultivators have low cultivation levels and limited wealth, so they mainly use low-quality Artifacts.   Having an offensive and defensive set of low-quality Artifacts would already put one above the vast majority of cultivators at the Early and Mid Stage of Qi Refining.   After all, He Song has already reached the Qi Refining Mid Stage, but at this point, he doesn’t even have a single low-quality Artifact.   Most other cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion are just like that.   Only loose cultivators, who face survival pressures in the outside world, would grit their teeth and purchase protective Artifacts for themselves during the Qi Refining Early Stage.   Meanwhile, Qi Refining Late Stage cultivators have abundant spirit power, so they basically use mid-quality Artifacts.   The Artifacts Wei Fan exchanged three years ago were both in a mid-quality offensive and defensive set.   This is considered to be normal among Qi Refining Late Stage cultivators. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m  As for high-quality and top-quality Artifacts.   They are only considered after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage.   They are too expensive and consume too much spirit power, making Qi Refining Late Stage cultivators generally unwilling to purchase them.   Of course, there are also Qi Refining Late Stage cultivators who use high-quality Artifacts, but since they consume too much spirit power, they are typically used only as trump cards, with only a few strikes of power.   Skills.   Spirit amulets.   Artifacts.   All these cultivation-aiding methods require a large amount of spirit stones.   After careful consideration, He Song decided, for the time being, to first master the Array Tao Introduction and set up the simplest Spirit-Gathering Array to improve his cultivation speed.   Later, he would spend spirit stones to learn skills and purchase spirit amulets.   Once he had enough spirit stones, he could proceed to buy Artifacts.   In this way, he would not delay his cultivation progress and also strengthen his battle capabilities.   Simply perfect!   Although his combat strength couldn’t be improved for the time being.   However, the Immortal Pavilion was relatively safe with the protection of   Foundation Establishment Masters. As lonq as no huze turmoil took place, the security was extremely strong.   After making up his mind, He Song poured himself a cup of tea and waited for Wei Fan in the small courtyard.   At night.    He Song set down the teacup in his hand, feeling a trace of worry in his heart.   Wei Fan had been gone for quite some time but still had not returned.   Could it be…   An unpleasant thought flashed through He Song’s mind as he looked at the darkening sky outside the courtyard, frowning gradually.   It shouldn’t be. After all, Wei Fan was a Qi-refining late stage cultivator, and he had just replaced his Artifacts and had enough spirit amulets on hand. How could he possibly fail against a fourth- tier Qi Refiner like Chen Zhou?   The difference in strength was too large.   However, just as He Song was starting to lose his patience and about to release a sound-transmitting paper crane to find out what happened.   Two figures appeared at the courtyard gate.   They were arm in arm, looking as if they hadn’t seen each other for a long time and were genuinely excited.   At first glance, He Song thought they were two drunkards.   But after observing carefully, He Song’s face revealed a smile of joy.   Pod pod pod…   With a series of rapid footsteps, He Song quickly arrived at the courtyard gate.   He opened the door.   “Wei, Lao Meng, what is this?” Looking at the two men hugging each other, He Song welcomed them into the courtyard before asking.   That’s right, the two men who appeared arm in arm were Wei Fan and Meng Guan.   Having been gone for three years at the Red Spirit Gold Mine without any news, Meng Guan now suddenly stood right in front of He Song, alive and well.   And what’s more, he came back with Wei Fan.   This scene filled He Song’s heart with questions.   Of course, after ushering the two men into the courtyard, he immediately started asking questions.   “Take a seat first, let’s sit down and talk slowly.” Wei Fan smiled, leading the two up to the loft.   Only after all three were seated and had a cup of tea in front of them did Wei Fan point to Meng Guan and began explaining to He Song.   “This time when I left the Immortal Pavilion, it was to kill Chen Zhou, right? After I chased him out of the Immortal Pavilion, he disappeared like a slippery fish.”   “Fortunately, he encountered me. Just three years ago, I happened to learn a Tracking Skill. After casting the tracking skill, I chased him in the direction he fled for half a day.”   “I don’t know how far I went from the Immortal Pavilion, but as the sky gradually darkened, I finally caught up with him and killed him.”   “Coincidentally, just as I was about to turn his bones to ashes as He Song instructed, someone happened to pass by.”   “At first, I thought I’d kill that person as well, but then that person called me   ‘Weil.”   “So, we came back together.”   Looking at Meng Guan next to him, Wei Fan spoke with a somewhat strange expression on his face.   He didn’t expect to encounter Meng Guan, who had just left the Red Spirit Gold Mine and was about to return to the Immortal Pavilion, right after he had killed someone and was in the process of disposing of the body as He Song had instructed.   At that time, Meng Guan had asked him with a puzzled face what he was doing. What else could he be doing….destroying the corpse and concealing his tracks!

Chapter 48: Chapter 48: So Poor   Translator: 549690339   It was fortunate that it was Meng Guan who came across this scene; if it were other cultivators, there would probably be another life taken in his hands.   Thinking about Meng Guan’s expression and involuntary inquiry at the time, Wei Fan couldn’t help but smile.   He actually really dared to ask such a question.   However, after thinking about it, Wei Fan couldn’t blame him.   Meng Guan was his good friend, and it was reasonable for a friend to ask a question when they saw him disposing of a body.   If it were someone else, Meng Guan would probably have been running away with the Breath Concealment Formulas the instant he saw this scene.   He wouldn’t have come forward and asked questions then.   “I was only a hundred miles away from the Red Spirit Gold Mine when I saw someone who looked just like Wei killing a loose cultivator with a single sword. I was startled and immediately used the Breath Concealment Formulas to hide. I didn’t even dare to recognize him,” said Meng Guan, his face flushed red, and his beard twitching as he added a few more words.   “Only when I hid and observed for a while and confirmed that it was indeed Wei, did I come out and recognize him. Alas, it was later revealed that this loose cultivator had actually made an enemy out of my friends. He really deserved to die!”   In the end, Meng Guan shook his head, a fierce look appearing on his face.   Judging by his appearance, it seemed that if it wasn’t for Wei Fan, he would have ground Chen Zhou’s bones and scattered his ashes himself.   At this moment, after listening to the vivid descriptions of the two, He Song was rendered speechless.   Who could have thought that when Wei Fan left Immortal Pavilion to kill people for him, he would bring Meng Guan back as well?   Just when He Song saw Wei Fan and Meng Guan at the entrance of the courtyard earlier, he hadn’t even thought about it.   But it really happened.   This…   It was just too coincidental.   “By the way, I brought back some of Chen Zhou’s ashes and put them in his storage bag. Here.” After explaining the situation, Wei Fan quickly took a storage bag from his chest and handed it to He Song.   Before leaving the small courtyard, he had promised He Song that he would bring back some of his ashes.   Now that Chen Zhou was dead and his body was burned, he naturally brought back some ashes as well.   Not a lot, but enough.   As for the storage bag, it was naturally found on Chen Zhou’s body.   A small storage bag containing a space of about one cubic meter for storing items.   One could usually buy it for a hundred spirit stones at the Artifacts Pavilion.   Chen Zhou’s storage bag was just like that.   Although a hundred spirit stones were considered quite a lot for Qi Refining Early Stage and Qi-refining mid-stage cultivators, it didn’t pique the interest of Wei Fan, who was at the Qi-refining late-stage.    Taking the storage bag, He Song immediately input a spirit power.   Suddenly, a pile of things appeared before He Song.   A small jar.   Several spirit amulets.   A small pile of spirit stones.   A few sets of changeable clothes.   A set of Thick Earth Formulas.   And some other miscellaneous items.   Glancing over each item, He Song’s gaze rested on the small jar for a moment.   If he was not mistaken, Chen Zhou’s ashes should be in this jar.   As for the other things-   He Song took a quick glance and quickly calculated the price.   The several spirit amulets were all low-quality and worth twenty to thirty spirit stones.   In the small pile of spirit stones, He Song counted a total of fifty-four.   The changeable clothes were not worth any money, the Thick Earth Formulas were not worth any money, and the miscellaneous things were not worth any money either.   In summary,   The value of Chen Zhou’s possessions, including the storage bag, was only around one hundred and eighty spirit stones.   “So poor.”   With a sigh in his heart, He Song shook his head, feeling that this meager wealth really wasn’t worthy of Chen Zhou the Loose cultivator’s status.   Isn’t it said that Loose cultivators are wealthier than Immortal Pavilion cultivators?   Now that he looked at it, it didn’t seem to be anything special. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m  However, after thinking about it, He Song felt relieved.   Loose cultivators are involved in dangerous and high-stakes work. The resources they gained were most likely used for their own cultivation.   If it weren’t for joining the Immortal Pavilion as a spiritual plant farmer and having a stable income, Chen Zhou’s fortune would probably be even less. Thinking about himself, He Song couldn’t help but feel dumbstruck.   Comparatively, Chen Zhou was richer.   He Song currently had only about a dozen spirit stones and didn’t even have a storage bag.   Truth be told, he was the poorest of them all.   “Fellow Daoist, you just take these spoils of war. In the future, just remember that you owe me a favor, ” said Wei Fan, eyebrows raised with a smile on his face, upon seeing He Song empty the contents of the storage bag.   Of the three of them, He Song had the lowest cultivation level and the lowest annual salary.    Now that he has finally broken through to the Qi-refining mid-stage, his yearly salary had just increased, but it was not much.   Wei Fan himself was a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator with many resources at his disposal.   Meng Guan was a sixth-tier Qi Refining cultivator. After working as a small leader in the Red Spirit Gold Mine for three years, his wealth was also quite bountiful.   Only He Song had just broken through to the Qi-refining mid -stage and had not yet started receiving this year’s salary.   Seeing He Song in such a predicament, he naturally wanted to lend him a hand.   After a few years, when He Song starts receiving his mid-stage Qi Refining   annual salary, his financial situation would gradually improve.   At that time, he wouldn’t need to worry about such trivial matters anymore.   Wei Fan didn’t care about a little over a hundred spirit stones.   A few years later, He Song wouldn’t care about such a small amount of spirit stones either.   When Wei Fan mentioned owing him a favor, it was just so He Song would accept the items.   “Right, fellow Daoist, just take it. When the time comes, just owe him a favor, and that’s fine. Now that you’ve broken through to the Qi-refining mid-stage and have received more spirit stones, you’ll realize in a few years that these spirit stones are inconsequential,” Meng Guan nodded in agreement upon seeing Wei Fan persuading He Song.   Previously, Meng Guan was the manager of Spiritual Medicine Pavilion. Although his cultivation and position were not as high as Wei Fan’s, he also understood the ways of the Immortal Pavilion cultivators.   The annual salary acquired based on rank among Immortal Pavilion cultivators might not be much.   However, there are other sources of income.   For example, Zhao Lin, the amulet Tao master, can earn spirit stones by making amulets, apart from his annual salary from the Immortal Pavilion.   With just the annual salary from the Immortal Pavilion, one might not receive many spirit stones in a year.   However, if you add the spirit stones earned through the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, the income would increase significantly.   This was the main reason why the vast majority of Qi-refining mid-stage cultivators could save spirit stones.   Ordinary cultivation, buying elixirs, Artifacts, spirit amulets, and acquiring skills all require spirit stones.   If there was no extra income, relying solely on the annual salary issued by the Immortal Pavilion would make it difficult to make ends meet.   A few years would be enough for ordinary cultivators to practice a skill from the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth and earn spirit stones through it.   That was the reasoning behind their mention of a few years.   “Alright, then I shall respectfully comply. This favor will be etched in my heart.” After considering it, He Song didn’t refuse.   If Wei Fan and Meng Guan were willing to help, it was only right for him to accept their offer.   After all, just as they said, no one would care about some hundred or so spirit stones in a few years.   Furthermore, He Song would keep this favor in his heart.   However, He Song was somewhat skeptical about their words.   It had been three years, and he still hadn’t mastered the Array Tao Introduction.   Even if he did master the array tao and could set up a Spirit-Gathering Array, he wouldn’t dare risk his life to help others set up arrays for spirit stones.   Therefore, he couldn’t be sure if he would really be indifferent to over a hundred spirit stones in a few years.   He Song couldn’t even assure himself of that..

Chapter 49: Chapter 49: A Bountiful Harvest   Translator: 549690339   Since both of his friends agreed, He Song didn’t dispute and accepted the benefits.   As for favours, he could pay them back slowly over time.   After all, he planned to live a long time.   If he couldn’t repay them immediately, it would be fine to return the favour to their descendants.   Thinking this way, He Song casually accepted the pile of goods in front of him, and then thanked the two men in front of him with a bow of his hand.   The two men waved their hands in a gesture of indifference.   The matter about Chen Zhou was settled.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   He Song lightly rubbed the storage bag in his hand, breathing out a sigh of relief in his heart.   Good that he’s dead.   Good that he’s dead.   Only the dead would pose no threat to him.   Just like Chen Zhou, who had offended him and begun to secretly investigate him.   He Song wouldn’t give such a person the opportunity to retaliate.   He was not one to let enemies grow powerful enough to threaten him.   If he felt threatened, he would eliminated that danger as quickly as possible.   If not for the shot.   The shot would be a thunderbolt.   Couldn’t beat him? No problem, a friend could assist him instead.   Although asking a friend for help required payment, once his own cultivation improved and he accumulated more spirit stones, this small expense wouldn’t be significant.   Besides, Chen Zhou’s death had brought him a storage bag and a few tens of spirit stones.   Although he would have to return these things down the line, having them now would allow He Song to grow stronger more quickly.   A few tens of spirit stones.   If he used these to purchase skills, He Song believed his power would increase.   The increase might be slight and would require time to master the skills, but it would definitely lead to an improvement.   Once his own strength was substantial enough and his enemies were relatively weak, then He Song would consider secretly eliminating threats.   After carefully considering everything from Chen Zhou’s first appearance to Wei Fan bringing Chen Zhou’s ashes, He Song’s mind gradually stabilized.    He handled this crisis perfectly.   From the moment he offended Chen Zhou to Chen Zhou’s ashes appearing in front of him, less than a day had passed.   He quickly eliminated the crisis, at least in He Song’s eyes, without any mistake.   As for Chen Zhou.   He might never have expected.   To offend someone in the morning.   Moreover, it was not a face-to-face confrontation but rather a subtle investigation of the opponent’s information. Then… by dusk, his life was already over.   Not only was his body cremated.   His ashes were put in a small jar and brought to He Song.   Perhaps until his death, he would never know who wanted to kill him.   Now that Chen Zhou is dead.   All that remains is to occasionally keep an eye out to see if anyone seeks revenge for him.   Given Wei Fan’s and his own connections within the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, they would be the first to know if anything happens.   There’s no need to worry too much.   He Song’s eyebrows gradually relaxed.   On the side, Wei Fan and Meng Guan also began discussing what they had both experienced over the past three years.   He Song listened while learning about the changes in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and the Red Spirit Gold Mine over the past three years.   The Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   What Wei Fan learned was not different from what He Song knew.   Ever since Master Cheng Shan returned three years ago, the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion began to recruit loose cultivators on a grand scale.   However, because of this, the quality of the new members in the Immortal Pavilion started to vary.   There were some like He Song who were recruited into the Pavilion while still in the first-tier Qi Refining.   There were some like Chen Zhou who were recruited into the Pavilion when they had reached the Qi-refining mid stage.   More of them, however, were loose cultivators from the second to third-tiers of the Qi Refining, and they were also recruited into the Pavilion. There were differences among these three types of cultivators.   First.   Cultivators like He Song who were in the first-tier Qi Refining when they joined the Pavilion, could quickly adjust to the inside of the Pavilion, steadily increase their cultivate, and wouldn’t cause trouble.   In the recruitment process three years ago, most of the cultivators recruited had a clear mind and hadn’t gone through life as a loose cultivator.   Among the cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion, a large portion would join the Thick Earth Sect if they luckily established their foundation. Naturally, the sect hoped that the cultivators’ minds were pure so they could further their cultivation after joining the sect.   Second.    Cultivators like Chen Zhou who joined the Pavilion in the Qi-refining mid stage had difficulty adjusting. Although they had settled down more than when they were loose cultivators, their core temperament still reflected the habits of being a loose cultivator.   Take Chen Zhou as an example whose nature was wayward. He often bullied the weak, extorted spirit stones, and always sought to do evil was the norm for such mid-stage Qi refining cultivators.   The Pavilion’s upper echelons had complaints about this kind of cultivator, but since the Pavilion currently needed their labor, they turned a blind eye.   Perhaps, when they no longer need these cultivators in the future, those with twisted characters will face the fate of being discarded after use.   Third.bender   Cultivators who were loose cultivators from the second-tier to third-tier of Qi Refining.   This group of cultivators, who had gone through the period of being a loose cultivator, understood how harsh and dangerous life as a loose cultivator could be.   Also, due to their low cultivation level, they basically belonged to the cautious and conscientious category.   They didn’t make much noise inside the Pavilion, but their numbers were quite large.   Because they had spent some time as a loose cultivator, so far, only a few of these cultivators had shown abnormal behavior.   Besides this.   In the past three years, there were sporadic rumors of evil cultivators haunting outside the Pavilion.   But hardly anyone paid attention.   As long as these evil cultivators do not enter the Pavilion, no one would care.   After Wei Fan shared the changes that occurred in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion over the past three years, allowing Meng Guan to better understand the Pavilion.   Their attention then shifted onto Meng Guan.   When two friends looked at him simultaneously, Meng Guan naturally understood that it was his turn to speak.   Consequently, He Song and Wei Fan quickly learned of the secrets within the Red Spirit Gold Mine from Meng Guan.   According to Meng Guan.   The Red Spirit Gold Mine was rich in Red Spirit Gold.   After going through a large-scale attack by several Foundation Establishment Masters three years ago, many of the mining loose cultivators were killed or injured. Since then, the mine constantly recruited loose cultivators to mine gold.   Over the three years that he had acted as supervisor in the red spirit gold mine, the depths of the pits became deeper and deeper.   Cultivators often died on the spot because they dug out strange things.   Some cultivators came across other valuable items and were rewarded.   Mostly, the deeper they went, the richer was the Red Spirit Gold.   Fortunately, Meng Guan was a supervisor and didn’t need to go down into the mines, so he naturally avoided countless dangers.   While retelling his experience, Meng Guan couldn’t help but thank He Song and Wei Fan.   Before leaving for the Red Spirit Gold Mine, only He Song and Wei Fan had advised him against it.   Wei Fan, especially, had done him a great kindness by informing him in advance. If it were not for Wei Fan’s timely information, he would not have become a supervisor. If he had gone to mine gold, he might have already been dead by now.   He had stated before, three years ago, that he wanted to thank both of them properly when he returned..

Chapter 50: Chapter 50: Green Wall Immortal City   Translator: 549690339   However, as He Song had guessed, Meng Guan did not mention the part about inviting them for drinks in the original sound-transmitting paper crane message.   Seeing this, He Song and Wei Fan exchanged a smile and didn’t take it to heart.   Both of them knew Meng Guan’s personality well.   He would never take them out for such a drinking session.   At least, the Meng Guan of three years ago would never have done that.   It seemed the same was true for him now.   There would be no alcohol, but he was sure to express his gratitude to them in some other form.   Since Meng Guan insisted on thanking the two of them, he would indeed do so, just in another way.   He Song and Wei Fan were not worried about this.   After expressing his gratitude verbally, Meng Guan continued his story.   Over the past three years, he had worked in the Red Spirit Gold Mine, made friends with some loose cultivators, and witnessed their hard lives as well as their terrifying speed in earning spirit stones.   In the Immortal Pavilion, the annual rent they had to pay took up most of the income of a mid-stage Qi-refining cultivator.   Due to the rent, cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion were generally poorer than loose cultivators.   Loose cultivators, on the other hand, didn’t have to pay rent.   Ten spirit stones per month might not seem like much rent. However, it amounted to 120 spirit stones per year.   He Song’s current annual salary was only ninety spirit stones for personal use.   Being able to save that many spirit stones, the lives of loose cultivators were generally better off than those in the Immortal Pavilion.   It should be noted that the jobs available to loose cultivators were usually life-threatening and highly dangerous, thus their rewards were naturally higher.   Under such circumstances, compared to Immortal Pavilion cultivators, loose cultivators indeed lived more comfortably.   It’s just that cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion had a more stable lifestyle. As for loose cultivators, they faced greater danger but also had more wealth.   At this point, Meng Guan turned his gaze towards Wei Fan.   He stood up.   And saluted respectfully.   “The reason I left the Red Spirit Gold Mine this time is that I have earned enough spirit stones. I would like to invite Wei to accompany me to Green Wall Immortal City to purchase the Breakthrough Elixir.”   Meng Guan took this salute very seriously.   Even though he had known Wei Fan for so long and they had become good friends, he still treated the matter with great importance.   When Meng Guan left the Immortal Pavilion to go to the Red Spirit Gold Mine three years ago, he was already forty-three years old.            Now, three years later, he was forty-six.   He had less than fourteen years left to reach the optimal age of sixty for breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage.   To break through from the sixth-tier Qi Refining stage to the ninth-tier Qi Refining stage in such a short time and obtain a Foundation Establishment Elixir would be extremely difficult.   Even without the Foundation Establishment Elixir and choosing to force a breakthrough, with Meng Guan’s Five Spirits Roots aptitude, even if he successfully advanced to the seventh-tier Qi Refining stage this time, it would still be incredibly difficult to break through to the ninth-tier Qi Refining stage in such a short time.   However, in Meng Guan’s view,   since he had already resigned from his position in the Immortal Pavilion and decided to forge ahead, he needed to risk his life. Even if there was only a slim chance, he would set foot on this inevitably thorny path!   As long as he could successfully break through to the late Qi-refining stage this time, he was confident that he could cultivate to the ninth-tier Qi Refining stage before the age of sixty and make an attempt at the Foundation Establishment Realm.   As for the final outcome,   Meng Guan didn’t want to think too much about it.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m   Since he had decided to risk his life, there was no need to think about anything else.   The determination in Meng Guan’s eyes made He Song sit up straight.   In front of him, facing Meng Guan’s serious salute, Wei Fan’s face immediately turned serious as well.   “Lao Meng, our friendship doesn’t require such formalities. Fine, I will accompany you on this trip. It’s just a Breakthrough Elixir, and I can protect it.”   After a while, Wei Fan agreed.bender   He had thought a lot about it.   The risks of going to Green Wall Immortal City.   The danger after purchasing the Breakthrough Elixir.   The danger during Meng Guan’s breakthrough.   The possible dangers of returning to                  Pavilion.   Having considered almost all possibilities and believing that he could handle them without too much difficulty, he agreed to the request.   A Qi-refining late-stage cultivator buying a mid -stage Breakthrough Elixir is bound to come with some risks but not many.   He had confidence in handling such situations.   If Meng Guan succeeded in breaking through, there would be virtually no danger with the support of two late-stage Qi-refining cultivators.   “Thanks to you, Wei, for agreeing to accompany me to Green Wall Immortal City. If I were to go there alone, it could be dangerous, but with your company, there’s no problem.”   Upon seeing Wei Fan’s agreement, Meng Guan heaved a sigh of relief, and his old face immediately filled with joy.   Although he had anticipated Wei Fan’s agreement, when he finally agreed, Meng Guan couldn’t help but feel overjoyed.   This meant that he had not misjudged Wei Fan.   At the same time, it also meant that his trip to Green Wall Immortal City to buy the Breakthrough Elixir would now be free of hidden dangers.   Finally, it signified that the bond between him, Wei Fan, and He Song was still intact after three years had passed.            Naturally, he felt delighted at the moment and was greatly reassured.   However, just as he indulged in his joy, Wei Fan spoke up again.   He looked at He Song.   “Fellow Daoist, would you like to come with us to Green Wall Immortal City for a visit? It’s not like the Immortal Pavilion. It’s a truly bustling place.”   Since he had already agreed to go with Meng Guan to Green Wall Immortal City, bringing one more person wouldn’t hurt.   After all, He Song was already at the mid-stage of Qi Refining now. If he came along, they would have one more combatant on their side.   Although Wei Fan knew He Song’s current combat power was almost negligible, other cultivators they encountered on the way wouldn’t know that.   With strength in numbers, they might avoid some trouble.   At the same time, it would be an eye-opening experience for He Song.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was just a marketplace established under the jurisdiction of Green Wall Immortal City for the convenience of nearby cultivators to trade.   The visiting cultivators were mostly low-level Qi Refining cultivators from the surrounding areas, and it was rare to see a Foundation Establishment Master.   He Song had been in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion for almost ten years and had never seen a Foundation Establishment Master other than Master Cheng Shan.   How could such a place compare to the Immortal City?   In Immortal City, Foundation Establishment Masters were rare but there were at least several who resided there permanently.   Sometimes, there were even visiting Foundation Establishment Masters from other places.   The goods sold in the Immortal City were also of a higher grade than those found in the Immortal Pavilion.   However.   Just as Wei Fan expected He Song to agree,   He Song shook his head repeatedly after hearing what was said.   “Forget it, you guys go ahead. Immortal City has its advantages, and so does the Immortal Pavilion. For now, I prefer staying here.”   As he said this, He Song continued to wave his hands, trying to dispel Wei Fan’s idea.   Immortal City?   Why go to                      City?   He could do as he pleased in this small Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Even if someone offended him, he could use his connections to make them vanish off the face of the earth.   Why go to the Immortal City to be at the bottom of the hierarchy when he could be a tyrant here?   Once in Immortal City, what would his meager connections amount to?   Not to mention Wei Fan was only a seventh-tier Qi Refining cultivator. Even if he were at the ninth- tier, it was doubtful he could make a name for himself in Immortal City.   In such circumstances, the protection he could provide would naturally decrease significantly.   If He Song were to offend a Foundation Establishment cultivator in Immortal City, he might even drag Wei Fan down, and neither of them could escape.   Though this was a low-probability event, He Song felt that it was better to stay in the Immortal Pavilion for the time being since he lacked the ability to protect himself..            

Chapter 51: Chapter 51: Farewell   Translator: 549690339   At least.   He Song didn’t need to worry about being stepped on and killed after offending others.   Within this small Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, He Song’s foundation was very solid, and generally, no one would harm him.   He’d rather stay, instead of entering the Immortal City while his strength isn’t at its peak.   It would be better to wait until his cultivation has reached the Qi-refining late stage and he needs to progress to the Foundation Establishment Realm, then move onto the Immortal City for breakthrough opportunities.   By then, he should have some self-defense capabilities and won’t have to be overly cautious in the Immortal City.   Thinking all these, He Song’s face showed an even more resolute refusal.   Let whoever wants to go to the Immortal City go.   He’s not going, not now.   Even just to take a look, it’s not feasible.   No one knows what could happen in an Immortal City.   The outside world, too dangerous.   Seeing He Song shaking his head continuously, his face full of refusal, Wei Fan was not surprised by this attitude. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com  His friend.   Still as careful as ever.   “Alright, if you don’t want to go, I won’t insist. But during the time when I’m away, I hope you’ll stand in for me at the Spirit Construction Pavilion.”   As a steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, Wei Fan couldn’t leave the Pavilion without saying a word.   If he dares to leave quietly, the Pavilion dare to quietly withdraw his position.   Thus, when Meng Guan came calling, he could only temporarily assign his duties to He Song.   He didn’t trust anyone else.   The previous invitation for He Song to go to the Immortal City with him was also a test.   If He Song also wanted to go, then he would have to entrust it to someone else.   But by then, he would have his arrangements to ensure no one messes up.   “It’s a small matter, let Brother Wei tell me the responsibilities when he is ready. I would indeed enjoy getting a taste of being a steward of the Spirit   Construction Pavilion.”   He Song nodded in agreement.   Then, as if thinking of something, he quickly took out several spirit amulets from his body.    Wei Fan had given these amulets to He Song for protection before going to kill Chen Zhou.   Now Wei Fan has returned and Chen Zhou is dead.   He Song would naturally return these amulets to their original owner.   Not to mention, Wei Fan and Meng Guan are about to head for Green Wall Immortal City.   Even though there wouldn’t be any trouble when a late-stage Qi-refining cultivator and a sixth-tier Qi refining cultivator go to Green Wall Immortal City together.   However, it’s better to be safe than sorry.   Returning these amulets to Wei Fan would make their journey safer.   “These are the spirit amulets you gave me for protection. Now that Chen Zhou is dead, you should take them back. Besides, you are going away, and it would be good to have these amulets for protection.”   Handing the amulets in his hand over to Wei Fan, He Song nodded to him.   These were all high-quality spirit amulets, which could only exert their full power when deployed by a late-stage Qi refining cultivator. In He Song’s hands, they would simply be wasted.   “Thank you for your consideration,”   Wei Fan felt a warm feeling inside as he accepted the amulets.   He had further recognition for He Song.   Although these spirit amulets were given out by him, He Song remembered them and returned them to him before he left, this consideration meant everything.   For the rest of the time, the three of them drank and chatted on the loft, they were absolutely joyful.   That night.   All three stayed in Wei Fan’s small courtyard.   The Pavilion enforced a curfew, at night, unless you had a special identity, one would be treated as an Evil Cultivator by the Law Enforcement Team if caught.   Even though He Song had his own home, he didn’t want to take a risk on the streets at night.   Not to mention the danger.   There’s a chance of being caught by the Law Enforcement Team.   That would inevitably cause some trouble.   Wei Fan and Meng Guan left early the next morning.   He Song went to see them off, but he didn’t go too far. He stopped at the entrance of the Pavilion.   Moving any further would be somewhat dangerous.   He had no choice but to stop there.   Cultivators were known for their speed.   After bidding farewell to his two friends at the entrance of the Pavilion, He Song saw two indistinct figures rushing towards the distance like ghosts.   The speed was as fast as lightning.   It was unknown whether they had cultivated some sort of tunneling skill.    After sending off the two, He Song first returned to his spirit field. He carefully carried out the Spirit Rain Skill for half an hour, then he turned towards the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Before Wei Fan’s departure, he formally introduced He Song to everyone in the Spirit Construction Pavilion, requesting that He Song stand in his place.   Naturally, after He Song finishes taking care of his spirit field, he would need to attend to his duty at the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   It’s worth mentioning.   There is no specific duties for the position of the steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Rather than calling it a position, it’s more like a management role.   Most of the tasks in the Spirit Construction Pavilion are carried out by the people below.   As a steward, all he needed to do was ensure those underneath him kept things in order.   Beyond occasionally receiving some internal cultivators who come to renew their rent, there were no other matters.   If he didn’t feel like receiving these internal cultivators, He Song could even seclude himself in the Pavilion every day, and no one would dare disturb him.   This made He Song sigh unavoidably.   In the cultivation world.   Being highly skilled really allowed you to do whatever you wanted.   Such an easy job, he couldn’t even dream of in his previous life, unless he had connections.   But for He Song, working at the Spirit Construction Pavilion didn’t affect anything.   Every morning, he’d go out to his managed seven-acre spirit field to carry out the Spirit Rain Skill for half an hour.   If he doesn’t need to go to the Spirit Construction Pavilion today, he’d just go home and continue contemplating Array Tao Introduction.   If he has to go to the Spirit Construction Pavilion, he’d enter the Pavilion and spend the day there, still contemplating Array Tao Introduction.   In other words.   Taking up the duty of a steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion didn’t affect He Song at all.   His understanding of Array Tao Introduction also increased day by day.   Moreover.   Because he had acquired all of Chen Zhou’s properties, He Song had a dozen spirit stones more than before.   With these dozen spirit stones, He Song’s skill in engraving array patterns on spirit stones quickly improved.   Under the consumption of a large amount of spirit stones, the technique of He Song carving array patterns became more stable, more precise, and more proficient.   And as spirit stones were constantly consumed, more spirit Qi was released when spirit stones shattered.   After being absorbed by He Song, his cultivation naturally started to increase.   This continued for several months. One day.   Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Second floor.   He Song was sitting on a cushion, holding a spirit stone in his hand. With his body’s spirit power flowing out, he carefully engraved array patterns into it. Engraving array patterns required a special technique, using the internal spirit power as a base to engrave the profound array patterns into the spirit stone.   In this way, once the array patterns in the spirit stone are formed, they could serve as the foundation of an array.   Once the Array Foundation is successful, this spirit stone could be used for array formation..

Chapter 52: Chapter 52: Spirit- Gathering Array!   Translator: 549690339   Of course, different Array Skills require different Array Foundations.   What He Song is creating now is the Spirit-Gathering Array’s foundation.   Spirit-Gathering Array.   It requires a total of five array foundations.   Only after completing all of them can one proceed to the next step.   Setting up the array.   It also requires the use of a special technique.   Using a special method to input the array foundations into specific positions, then connecting them in a unique way, and finally establishing a connection with the world’s energy.   Only then can a true array be formed.   When the array patterns within the foundations resonate with the power of the world, continuously producing special effects, the array is formed successfully.   These are the introductions to Array Tao of the Array Tao Introduction volume.   At the same time, it is also what He Song has been pursuing.   At one moment,   He Song, who was originally sitting on the cushion, carefully carving array patterns, let out a deep breath.   At the same time, his face showed a joyful expression.   “Success!” Holding the spirit stone with the carved array pattern in his hand, He Song admired his masterpiece, and a strong sense of accomplishment immediately emerged.   This feeling is great!   After over three years, He Song finally completed carving the five array foundations required for the Spirit-Gathering Array. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com  The completion of the five array foundations,   signifies that He Song has taken a big step forward in setting up the Spirit-Gathering Array.   Next,   he just needs to use the special technique from Array Tao Introduction to input the five array foundations into their designated positions, connect them using the refined method, and establish the connection between the array and the world’s energy. With the help of several spirit stones, he can successfully set up the Spirit-Gathering Array!   The special technique in Array Tao Introduction has long been memorized by heart.   During these three years, he has been constantly practicing this special technique, fully mastering it.   Now, when the array foundations are completed, he only needs to find a place to set up the array, and he can successfully create the Spirit-Gathering Array.            Becoming a true Array Path Master!   He Song decided to put it away into his storage pouch.   He Song is currently in Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Setting up the Spirit-Gathering Array in Spirit Construction Pavilion would be too troublesome, for once Wei Fan returns, he would have to leave and dismantle the array to move it back to his own home.   Therefore, after some thought, He Song chose to collect the array foundation and decided to set up the array later, after returning home at night.   Seated meditation and cultivation.   While He Song was in seated meditation, time passed quickly in the outside world. Soon, it was dusky.   After saying goodbye to the others in Spirit Construction Pavilion, He Song returned home alone.   Inside the quiet chamber,   He Song stretched out his hand and immediately, the five special spirit stones appeared in his palm.   These five spirit stones are no longer ordinary spirit stones since they have already been carved with array patterns and transformed into array foundations.   With these five array foundations, he just needs to place them in specific positions using the specialized method, and then connect them in order to establish the array, drawing power from the world.   However, He Song was not in a hurry to set up the array, instead, he took a deep breath and adjusted his state to the best condition.   Then he made his move.   He saw He Song picking up a foundation with one hand, then forming hand signs. The array foundation in his hand suddenly flew out like a swallow returning to its nest, landing steadily in the center of the quiet chamber.   Then, He Song picked up another array foundation and repeated the hand signs several times.   Finally, the five array foundations had landed in their intended locations.   At the same time, at the location of the five array foundations, threads of spiritual light began to emerge from the array patterns within, quickly connecting the five array foundations together, forming an incomparably mysterious array pattern.   This is the unique array pattern of the Spirit-Gathering Array.   The purpose of carving the array foundations is to use the pattern within to guide the formation of this mysterious array pattern.   At this point,   He Song just needed to use a special technique to induce the power of the world using the array pattern, and the Spirit-Gathering Array would be complete.   With the essentials of setting up the Spirit-Gathering Array flashing through his mind,   He Song quickly began forming hand signs.   The next moment, a bright light suddenly flashed in the dim quiet chamber. Immediately, the light disappeared as if it had never appeared. Yet within the quiet chamber,   He Song was already showing a delighted expression at this moment.   After forming the hand signs, the array pattern of the Spirit-Gathering Array he set up had activated the power of the world, successfully creating the Spirit-Gathering Array!            By setting up the Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song had become a real Array Path Master at that moment.   Although he could only create the simplest of arrays, the Spirit-Gathering   Array, he could now call himself an Array Path Master.   This was a change in identity and, at the same time, a change in status. As long as He Song revealed he was an Array Path Master, he would surely attract the respect and greedy eyes of other cultivators.   “Great, great! I did it!”   Feeling the density of the spirit Qi inside the quiet chamber beginning to increase slowly, He Song’s face showed even more joy as he felt refreshed.   Over three years!   More than three years had passed, and finally, he had set up the simplest Spirit-Gathering Array. In these three years, He Song had been studying the Array Tao tirelessly.   Now, he finally saw the fruits of his labor.   Delight was there, refreshment was there, emotion was there, a mix of feelings.   However, just because the Spirit-Gathering Array was in place, it didn’t mean He Song could rest easy.   Thinking about this, He Song’s face turned solemn, and he quickly began forming hand signs again. A moment later,   After several adjustments,   He Song finally let out a sigh of relief.   “Fortunately, the Spirit-Gathering Array can control the scope of its effect. As long as I control the spirit Qi attracted by the array within the quiet chamber, I don’t need to worry about being discovered by others.”   He Song sighed silently in his heart, reminding himself to stay vigilant.   His identity as an Array Path Master must be kept hidden, used only to enhance his own cultivation.   He must never reveal it openly, otherwise, he would surely attract countless greedy gazes.   He just wanted to cultivate quietly and didn’t want to fight for his life against those ruthless cultivators.   As an everlasting being, one must have the awareness of being one.   Fighting for life and death can be done by other cultivators in order to advance, but absolutely not by him.   After the reminder, there was joy.   With the Spirit-Gathering Array in place, He Song’s cultivation speed was set to improve greatly!   This also meant that He Song’s cultivation progress in the Qi Refining stage would be much faster than before.   Perhaps, before, it took five years to break through a realm,   but by continually being under the effect of the Spirit-Gathering Array and absorbing even richer spirit Qi, breaking through a realm might only take four years now.   The time saved would ensure that He Song would not be seen as an oddity.   After all,   during the Qi Refining Early Stage, he never absorbed any spirit stones nor ate any elixirs.   His cultivation was entirely derived from the slow absorption of spirit Qi.   Compared to other cultivators with four spirits roots, He Song’s cultivation speed was indeed much slower..        

Chapter 53: Chapter 53: Wild Ambition   Translator: 549690339   Now with his cultivation reaching the Qi- refining mid-stage, He Song’s financial situation was still tight. For the next few years, without reaching a certain level of combat ability, He Song wouldn’t invest his spirit stones into his cultivation. Spirit amulets.   Skills.   Artifacts.   These three protective methods were what He Song desperately needed now.   As such, the rate of cultivation improvement from the spirit-gathering array band became particularly important for He Song.   Cultivating daily in the Spirit-Gathering Array, he should be able to keep up with the speed of cultivation of those with the same four spirits roots who use spirit stones and elixirs.   In fact, compared to those cultivators with the same four spirits roots but fewer cultivation resources, He Song’s cultivation speed should even faster.   After all, He Song was cultivating every day in the Spirit-Gathering Array, unlike those cultivators who practice with the aid of spirit stones or elixirs and don’t have them available every day.   In this way, He Song’s cultivation speed would be in a normal state.   He would not be treated as an anomaly by other cultivators with four spirits roots.   Nor would he attract the attention of others.   In the eyes of others, He Song would appear as an ordinary cultivator with four spirits roots.   If nothing unusual happens, who would care about an ordinary cultivator with four spirits roots?   After making the decision, He Song took out another five spirit stones from his storage bag and placed them into the Spirit-Gathering Array.   The Spirit-Gathering Array also needs to consume spirit stones.   In order to maintain the Spirit-Gathering Array continuously, it costs five spirit stones every year. Once a year has passed, the spirit stones need to be replaced in order to continue operating.   After placing the spirit stones, He Song began to meditate and cultivate.   It’s worth mentioning that,   the effect of the Spirit-Gathering Array right after it’s set up is actually not that good.   After cultivating for one night, He Song barely felt his internal spirit power slightly increased compared to when he didn’t have the Spirit-Gathering Array. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m  But He Song didn’t mind.   Array Tao Introduction has an early description of this matter. The Spirit-Gathering Array takes about ten days to reach its maximum efficiency after it is set up.   By then, the concentration of spirit Qi within the Spirit-Gathering Array is generally much higher than that in the surroundings.   Even if the Spirit-Gathering Array is set up in the mortal world, as long as it is inside the array, the aura concentration can rival the spirit Qi concentration within the Immortal Pavilion.    In other words, as long as you are an Array Path Master, you can build your own Immortal Pavilion outside.   However, whether the sect occupying this area will cause trouble for you,   or whether the Evil Cultivators of this area will raid your self-built Immortal Pavilion, it remains unknown.   Moreover, in order to cover an area as big as Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, one Spirit-Gathering Array is definitely not enough.   At the very least, probably at least eight or ten Spirit-Gathering Arrays are needed to work together to cover such a large area.   He Song had no intention of opening an Immortal Pavilion by himself outside.   However,   establishing one or even several spirit fields outside, that belonged only to him, was something He Song had planned to do since long ago.   Becoming an Array Path Master was just the first step in his plan.   Because only by becoming an Array Path Master could he set up a Spirit-Gathering Array.   Only by setting up a Spirit-Gathering Array could he utilize the spirit Qi gathered to nourish the land and turn it into a spirit field.   After transforming the land into spirit fields, only then could He Song plant spirit rice by himself within these fields.   And when the time for harvest came, he could sell the crops at high prices and gain a huge amount of spirit stones.   Establishing his own spirit fields outside the Immortal Pavilion had always been part of He Song’s plan.   Being a spiritual plant farmer within the Immortal Pavilion had no future.   Only by farming himself, could he earn more spirit stones and pave a smoother path of cultivation.   In other words,   He Song had never seen being a spiritual plant farmer within the Immortal Pavilion as his career.   It was just a stepping stone in the early stage.   If he truly wanted to acquire a large amount of resources, he had to rely on his own hands instead of farming for others year after year in the Immortal Pavilion.   “Sigh, I must consider the matter of opening a spirit field from a long-term perspective. At least… I need to fully master the Illusion Array and Five Phases Array in the Array Tao Introduction before I can really open the spirit field.”   In Array Tao Introduction, there are a total of three arrays that one can learn.   Firstly, the Spirit-Gathering Array, which gathers spirit Qi, nourishes oneself or the spirit field. He Song has set it up and mastered it.   Secondly, the Illusion Array, which is shrouded in mist, and veils illusions, confusing the hearts of mortals and even cultivators, unconsciously bypassing it. It is the most important part of hiding spirit fields. He Song hasn’t studied it yet.   Thirdly, the Five Phases Array, which is an integrated offense and defense system capable of killing enemies and fending off enemies. With the five phases generating each other, it’s an inexhaustible array. In case the location of the spirit fields is discovered, He Song could rely on it to kill the enemy as well as escape. He Song hasn’t studied it yet either.   Only after successfully studying all three array techniques and setting them up can He Song truly start opening his own spirit fields.   The three array techniques are interconnected.    The Spirit-Gathering Array nourishes the spirit fields, the Illusion Array conceals them, and the Five Phases Array provides integrated offense and defense. In this way, He Song can safely establish his own spirit fields.   His plan flashed through his mind, and He Song shook his head, got up, and left the room.   Now is not the time to think about these things.   He would consider them later, after his own strength had improved.   Upon going out,   He Song quickly arrived at the spirit field he managed.   After leisurely performing the Spirit Rain Skill for half an hour, He Song didn’t head to the Spirit Construction Pavilion but instead went towards the Stall   Section.   Immortal Pavilion Stall Section.   It has been a long time since He Song last visited.   Having lived in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion for nearly ten years, He Song had already explored the entire Immortal Pavilion and knew that there weren’t any missed opportunities to be found in the Immortal Pavilion Stall   Section.   He’s not some Doomed Son; he’s just an ordinary cultivator.   Naturally, knowing that there are no opportunities to be found, he no longer went to the Stall Section just to try his luck.   Walking down the street in the Immortal Pavilion Stall Section,   He Song’s eyes scanned the surroundings only to find that some familiar faces had gradually disappeared, replaced by new faces.   For example, the old man He Song met when he first went out to buy rice after crossing over here, had already disappeared.   The old rice stand was now occupied by a sturdy middle-aged man.   He Song stopped and observed for a moment, then finally shook his head and continued walking.   The old man,   He didn’t know whether he was dead or enjoying his twilight years at home.   If He Song remembered correctly, he once envied the old man for having a storage bag.   However, now,   He Song also had a storage bag.   But the old man from back then had already disappeared without a trace. With an unnamed emotion flashing through his mind, He Song walked quickly forward and soon arrived at his destination.   The Spirit Skill Pavilion.   As soon as he stepped into the Spirit Skill Pavilion, He Song felt someone else standing beside him.   At the same time, a fragrant breeze brushed past him.   “Mr. He, it’s been three years since we last met. I would like to congratulate you on your great progress in cultivation, and I believe the Foundation   Establishment is just around the corner..”

Chapter 54: Chapter 54: Ping’er   Translator: 549690339   The crisp female voice rang in He Song’s ear.   Upon hearing the words, He Song immediately turned his head to look in the direction where the voice was coming from.   Suddenly, a familiar figure appeared in front of him.   With a flash of spiritual light in his eyes, He Song immediately clasped his hands together.   “It turns out to be Miss Ping’er. Indeed, it has been three years since we last met. I also congratulate Miss Ping’er for her great progress in cultivation, and her Foundation Establishment is within reach.”   The person in front of him was Ping’er, who had welcomed him to the Spirit Skill Pavilion during his first, second and even now, the third visit.   At this moment, He Song’s cultivation had already progressed from the first-tier Qi Refining at the time of his first visit, to the current fourth-tier of Qi Refining.   As for Ping’er’s cultivation, it had also progressed from unknown during his first visit, not paying attention during his second visit, to Qi-refining fourth-tier during his third visit.   When he first visited, He Song hadn’t yet learned the Spirit Vision Skill, so he naturally didn’t know Ping’er’s cultivation.   During the second visit, although He Song had learned the Spirit Vision Skill, he didn’t use it on Ping’er, so he naturally didn’t know her cultivation either.   On the third visit, which was this time, it was because Ping’er took the initiative to congratulate him on his great progress in cultivation that he used the Spirit Vision Skill and looked at her.   Only then did he find out that Ping’er’s cultivation was also at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining.   “I don’t know what my friend wants to order in this visit?” With a smile, Ping’er led He Song to a nearby desk to sit down and asked.   Her gaze was fixed on He Song without blinking, and there was a hint of unnoticeable surprise in her eyes.   Three years had passed.   She had originally thought that He Song, who once made her want to make friends with him, had died in the catastrophe three years ago.   She had even lamented about it for a while.   After all, He Song at that time was just a little cultivator at the third-tier of Qi Refining. It was not easy for him to survive in such a catastrophe.   Even she had survived only because of the help from a benefactor.   Otherwise, she might have died in that catastrophe three years ago as well.   The catastrophe was so terrifying, and its target was the cultivators who lived on the periphery of the Immortal Pavilion with more than the second-tier of Qi Refining and without self-preservation power.   To survive, one had to either leave in advance or be helped by a benefactor.    How did He Song manage to survive?   “Please show me some of the Qi Refining stage skills, Miss Ping’er. I need to make some selections.” Not paying attention to the surprise in Pinger’s eyes, He Song quickly stated his request.   This visit to the Spirit Skill Pavilion was for He Song to learn new skills.   His Spirit-Gathering Array had been set up.   As for the Five Phases Array and Illusion Array, these two Array Skills weren’t something that could be comprehended in a short period.   Naturally, if he wanted to improve his own strength, there were only two ways left: buying spirit amulets and learning skills.   As for buying spirit amulets, it was still too strenuous for He Song’s current financial situation.   Therefore, He Song could only come to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to learn Qi Refining stage skills to enhance his own strength. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)  “Alright, Mr. He, please wait a moment.”   Leaving a word, although there was some curiosity in Ping’er’s eyes, she still dutifully got up and left.   As Ping’er left,   another pretty-looking young girl came over and prepared a pot of hot tea for He Song.   Seeing this situation, He Song suddenly realized that the clothes on Ping’er were different from the previous two times he visited.   After asking the girl who had come later, He Song found out that Pinger had become one of the Stewards of the Spirit Skill Pavilion after she had broken through to the Qi-refining mid stage and no longer needed to play the role of a hostess for visiting cultivators like she previously did.   All she needed to do was to manage the people below and let them serve the guests.   Of course, if she felt like it, she could still serve guests personally.   Just like how she treated He Song. After making inquiries, the girl who came later left respectfully.   He Song was slightly stunned but suddenly realized that perhaps his own cultivation, which had reached the Qi-refining mid stage, had already become a “senior” who needed to be treated with respect in front of these Qi Refining Early Stage cultivators.   Or perhaps, it was because of his acquaintance with Pinger that this girl was so respectful to him.   Picking up the teacup and taking a sip,   the scene of his first meeting with Ping’er at the Spirit Skill Pavilion flashed through He Song’s mind.   At that time, he was only at the first-tier of Qi Refining, and all the cultivators in the Spirit Skill Pavilion had a strong spiritual pressure on them.   Everyone seemed like a senior to him.   Now it’s different.    With just a glance, he could see that most of the surrounding cultivators were at the Qi Refining Early Stage, and there were very few at the Qi-refining mid stage.   At this point, his current Qi-refining mid stage cultivation actually stood out as relatively high in the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   “Time flies by, and the scenery before me has changed.”   With a sigh in his heart, He Song shook his head and stopped thinking about those things.   Soon, the familiar figure returned again.   Placing the tray in front of He Song, Ping’er quickly noticed the teapot on the table.   Her gaze swept over the girls in the Spirit Skill Pavilion, and a hint of understanding flashed in her eyes, but she didn’t care.   “Mr. He, let me introduce these skills to you first.”   Picking up a jade slip from the tray, Pinger’s voice rang out gently.   “This is the Fireball Skill, one of the basic skills. It can form a powerful fireball to attack enemies and is worth ten spirit stones.”   “This is the Light Body Skill, one of the basic skills. It can enhance walking speed and is essential for traveling and escaping. It is worth ten spirit stones.”   “This is the Object Controlling Skills, a mid-grade skill. It allows you to project your spirit power and control objects around you, which can be very useful. It is worth fifty spirit stones.”   “This is the Mountain Light Body Skill, a mid-grade skill. It has a faster speed than the Light Body Skill and is essential for long-distance travel and escaping.   It is worth fifty spirit stones.”   “This is the Tracking Skill, a high-quality skill. After casting, it can leave a tracking mark on the enemy’s body, which is hard to detect and is worth one hundred spirit stones.”   “This is the Earth Tunneling Skill, a high-quality skill. After casting, it can allow you to tunnel into the ground and move at extremely fast speeds underground. However, be aware that it can easily be countered by the Earthshaking Skill and is worth one hundred spirit stones.”   “This is the Earthshaking Skill, a high-quality skill. After casting, it can shake the heavens and the earth, dealing great damage to enemies underground. It is worth one hundred spirit stones.”   “This is the Mountain Pressing Sword Technique, a high-quality attack skill. By using the Obiect Controlling Skills to mani Dulate flvinc swords. it has great power and is worth two hundred spirit stones.”   “This is… ‘   As Ping’er introduced one jade slip after another, He Song’s eyes flickered.   He wanted all of these!   However, after sensing the remaining thirty-five spirit stones in his storage bag, He Song’s heart sank.   These thirty-five spirit stones were taken from Chen Zhou’s storage bag.   The dozen or so spirit stones He Song originally had, plus the more than fifty he had taken from Chen Zhou’s storage bag, had all been used to engrave array patterns.   Engraving array patterns had a high chance of destroying spirit stones.   The rest of the spirit stones had all been spent on this.   At this moment, He Song had only thirty-five spirit stones left in his possession..

Chapter 55: Chapter 55: Why Aren I t You Robbing   Translator: 549690339   Luckily, He Song was quick to complete the array patterns for the   Spirit-Gathering Array, otherwise, he might not have been able to keep the thirty-five spirit stones.   “Mr. He, have a cup of tea first.”   Seeing that Ping’er had introduced all the jade slips, He Song casually handed her a cup of tea.   But in his mind, he started to think about which skills he should choose.   However, upon thinking about it more, He Song realized that he seemingly didn’t have a choice.   The prices of these skills were beyond his expectations.   Originally, He Song thought that Qi Refining stage skills shouldn’t be too expensive, around ten spirit stones or so.   Even special skills for the Qi Refining stage should only be slightly more expensive, not too outrageous.   Yet he didn’t expect that the prices Ping’er mentioned kept getting higher and higher. In the end, even a set of Sword Formulas required two hundred spirit stones to purchase.   Why not just rob people instead?   With a hint of doubt in his eyes, He Song looked at Pinger sitting next to him.   At He Song’s side.   Seeing his puzzled gaze, Ping’er was momentarily surprised, but quickly realized the reason.   It seemed that she understood what He Song wanted to ask.   “Mr. He, basic skills cost ten spirit stones each, mid-quality skills cost fifty spirit stones each, and high-quality skills cost one hundred spirit stones each. Attack skills cost double the original price and loose cultivators need to pay double the price for all skills. This is the rule of the Immortal Pavilion…” Her crisp voice rang out as she looked at He Song with a hint of confusion in her eyes.   Did he never learn the prices of skills before?bender   Did he just focus on cultivation and not have friends to discuss with?   Little did she know.   He Song barely communicated with others under normal circumstances.   Of the few acquaintances he had, none of them ever mentioned the prices of skills.    Those who were more advanced in cultivation than He Song, like Wei Fan, had high incomes and didn’t care about the prices.   Those who were at a similar cultivation level, like Zhao Lin, found the prices reasonable. As an amulet Tao master, Zhao Lin could afford it.   Those with lower cultivation levels wouldn’t have access to such information in the first place.   And He Song had always thought Qi Refining stage skills would all be in the same price range, so he never thought they would be expensive.   But now…   After listening to Ping’er’s explanation, He Song finally understood the astronomical costs of knowledge in the Cultivation World.   It turned out that not only did one need to spend spirit stones to learn cultivation knowledge, but higher-ranked skills also required a considerable amount of spirit stones to acquire.   Also, the gap between the staff of the Immortal Pavilion and loose cultivators was tremendously wide.   The cultivation knowledge was free for Immortal Pavilion staff while loose   cultivators had to pay a spirit stone per day.   Basic Qi Refining stage skills cost ten spirit stones for Immortal Pavilion staff, but twenty for loose cultivators.   Mid-quality Qi Refining stage skills cost fifty spirit stones for Immortal Pavilion staff, but a hundred for loose cultivators.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎   High-quality Qi Refining stage skills cost a hundred spirit stones for Immortal Pavilion staff, but two hundred for loose cultivators.   It can be said that loose cultivators had a much harder path.   He Song already had a deep understanding of this, but it was only after hearing Ping’er’s introduction to the prices that he truly realized just how hard it was for loose cultivators.   No wonder they were at the bottom of the contempt chain in the Cultivation World.   Feeling a sense of relief, He Song couldn’t help but silently thank his predecessor in his heart.   If it weren’t for the previous owner seizing the opportunity and gaining a foothold in the Immortal Pavilion, he probably wouldn’t have been able to cultivate in peace until now.   However, this wasn’t the time to think about those things.   After hearing Ping’er’s introduction, He Song could only focus on the only two basic skills he could afford.   Fireball Skill, one of the basic skills, can condense fireballs for attacking enemies with decent power, worth ten spirit stones.   Light Body Skill, one of the basic skills, can increase walking speed, essential for long journeys and escaping, worth ten spirit stones.   Flashes of Ping’er’s descriptions of these two basic skills went through He Song’s mind, and with a wave of his hand, twenty spirit stones appeared on the table in front of him.    “Mr. Ping’er, I can only afford those two basic skills for now,” He Song said, cupping his hands toward Ping’er without any change in expression.   “Alright, place the jade slips on your forehead to learn the skills,” Ping’er’s voice replied.   Seeing that He Song only bought two basic skills, Ping’er didn’t mind at all. After handing him the two jade slips, she picked up the twenty spirit stones from the table.   As she put away the spirit stones, a strange color flashed in her eyes.   If she hadn’t seen it wrong earlier, He Song had casually waved his hand and twenty spirit stones appeared on the table.   Though twenty spirit stones weren’t much, this action demonstrated that He Song had a storage bag on him.   Only those with a storage bag could perform such a gesture.   Her gaze shifted to He Song, who was currently placing the jade slips on his forehead, as a growing sense of disbelief filled her heart.   “His finances are meager, but he has a storage bag. Is Mr. He truly in a tight spot or…”   After pondering for a moment, her expression returned to normal, but the look in her eyes carried an indescribable meaning as she watched He Song.   Soon enough, He Song engraved all the information from the two jade slips into his memory.   With just a casual recollection, he could remember all the intricacies of casting these two skills.   Fireball Skill, one of the basic skills, can be used for attacking and as a daily utility due to its high temperature for destruction and concealing traces.   Light Body Skill, one of the basic skills, increases walking speed, making it essential for escaping and traveling long distances; a daily utility.   With these two skills, He Song would have some means of defense when encountering enemies.   Though the Fireball Skill’s power was not strong, it was still a more powerful offensive means than the Spiritl Arrow Skill.   Additionally, with the Light Body Skill, He Song could run away if he was unable to win a fight.   “We’re clear on both money and goods, I’ll take my leave now.”   Since everything was settled now, He Song got up, not giving it a second thought, and bid farewell to Ping’er with a cupped fist.   But just as He Song was about to turn around and leave, Ping’er stopped him with a smile.   “Mr. He, don’t be in such a rush. I recently got some good tea; if you like it, take some back with you. Just wait a moment, I’ll be right back.”   Before He Song could refuse, Ping’er had already disappeared from sight.   A short while later, He Song left the Spirit Skill Pavilion with a small box filled with tea leaves.   Behind him, Ping’er smiled sweetly, watching He Song’s figure disappear into the distance.   Since Ping’er had decided to befriend He Song three years ago, she naturally wouldn’t miss the opportunity now that they had met again..

Chapter 56: Chapter 56: Gifts   Translator: 549690339   One must give something in return for a favor.   One must first give their favor in order to begin building a relationship.   Building a good relationship with a young Qi-refining mid-stage cultivator, without giving anything in return, would be improper.   Watching He Song walk away, Ping’er pondered for a moment before finally shaking her head and heading up to the second floor.   Her personal reception of He Song was just an impulsive decision.   As one of the stewards in the Spirit Skill Pavilion, she usually stayed on the second floor.   Now that the gift was given.   She just had to wait for him to act.   Stall Section.   He Song walked home leisurely, glancing at the small box in hand from time to time.   The box was exquisite, seemingly carved from a precious type of wood found in the Mortal World.   Given the delicate patterns on it, the small box must be worth a fortune in the   Mortal World.   But, here was Cultivation World.   This exquisite small wooden box was only beautiful in appearance.   It was the tea leaves inside the little box that were truly valuable.   From He Song’s perspective.   The tea leaves in the small box were indeed of good quality.   At least, it was better than the tea leaves he usually drank when he was alone.   “Mr. He, if you find it boring to drink tea alone, don’t hesitate to invite me. My days on duty at the Spirit Skill Pavilion are also quite tedious.”   As He Song walked home, he recalled the words Ping’er had said after giving him the tea leaves.   Her words seemed to be unintentional, yet also deliberately emphasized.   He Song couldn’t understand.   But since she had already given him the gift, it must not be just an empty phrase to him.   At a loss to understand her intentions, he decided not to think about it further.   He would let things take their course and invite Ping’er using the Sound Transmission skill when he was truly drinking tea alone in the future.   By that time, he would naturally know her purpose.   Upon arriving home,   He Song put the box into his storage bag and immediately entered his meditation room to cultivate amidst the increasingly dense spirit Qi in the Spirit-Gathering Array.   Like this, a few days passed in the blink of an eye.   On this day,   He Song had just finished using the Spirit Rain Skill at his spirit field for half an hour when he saw a sound-transmitting paper crane flying from the sky and landed in front of him in the blink of an eye.    The sound-transmitting paper crane shimmered with spiritual light.   When He Song released his own breath, it turned back into a piece of thin paper and fell into his hands.   “Mr. He, I have returned from Green Wall Immortal City. Come to the Spirit   Construction Pavilion quickly, I have important matters to discuss.”   ‘Wei Fan.”   Glancing over the words on the paper, He Song put it away and immediately rushed towards the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Wei Fan was back.   Although he didn’t know what important matters he had to discuss, it must be related to him.   But what could be related to him while he had been in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion all this time?   Confused, He Song didn’t slow down his pace.   In a short while, he arrived at the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Second floor.   Upon stepping into the room, He Song saw Wei Fan, who was playing with a small object.   No one else was around Wei Fan.   “Come and sit down. This is the gift that Lao Meng picked for you in Green Wall Immortal City. Take a look.”   While He Song was still in his daze, Wei Fan had already gestured for He Song to come sit and showed him the object in his hand.   It was a small jade bottle.   Even the bottle cap showed a crystal-clear, jade-like quality.   If one looked closely, the appearance of the elixir inside the jade bottle was clearly visible.   He Song approached upon hearing this.   And took the jade bottle from Wei Fan’s hand.   Opened it.   A rich elixir fragrance immediately filled the air, causing He Song to tremble in his heart.   At the same time, He Song felt that the spirit power inside his body increased slightly just by smelling the fragrance.   “Is this? A middle-grade elixir, the Qi-Gathering Elixir?”   Closing the bottle cap, He Song had an uncertain thought about the Qi Refining stage elixir that flashed through his mind.   There are several elixirs available for the Qi Refining stage.   Inedia Elixir, not an elixir grade.   Qi Nourishing Elixir, low-grade elixir, suitable for use in the Qi Refining Early Stage to improve cultivation base.   Qi-Gathering Elixir, middle-grade elixir, suitable for use in the Qi-refining mid stage to improve cultivation base.   Qi Condensing Elixir, high-quality elixir, suitable for use in Qi-refining late stage to improve cultivation base.   Apart from these, there are also Breakthrough Elixirs, specifically used to overcome bottlenecks between minor realms.   Among these elixirs, except for the Inedia Elixir, which has a relatively simple refining method and can be barely refined by those learning elixir refinement, the rest of the elixirs can only be refined by elixir refinement masters.   Thus, the prices are high.    A bottle of ten Qi Nourishing Elixirs requires ten spirit stones.   A bottle of ten Qi-Gathering Elixirs requires even more, thirty spirit stones.   Qi Condensing Elixirs are even more expensive, requiring a full hundred spirit stones for one bottle.   As for the Breakthrough Elixirs, the prices are naturally even more expensive.   If the elixir in He Song’s hand was indeed a middle-grade elixir, the Qi-Gathering Elixir, the value would be at least thirty spirit stones.   It turned out that Meng Guan had brought such a great gift for him when he visited the Green Wall Immortal City.   This….   Having many thoughts flash through his mind, He Song didn’t know what to say at the moment.   “It is indeed a Qi-Gathering Elixir. Lao Meng had said before that he wanted to thank us. He bought a bottle of Qi Condensing Elixir for me, a bottle of Qi-Gathering Elixir for you, and a Breakthrough Elixir for himself.”   “Tsk, Lao Meng spent three years in the mine, plus his original savings, he actually saved up quite a few spirit stones.”   Wei Fan nodded in confirmation of He Song’s guess and then let out a sigh.   It was unclear whether he was sighing about Meng Guan spending all his saved spirit stones in such a short time or if he was sighing about something else.   Sat down beside Wei Fan.   He Song held the jade bottle for a moment before carefully putting it into his storage bag.   He had never used a Qi-Gathering Elixir worth thirty spirit stones before.   Even the Qi Nourishing Elixir used in the Qi Refining Early Stage, He Song had never used before.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎   All along, he had been absorbing the spirit Qi within the Immortal Pavilion to cultivate and was unfamiliar with elixirs.   Now that Meng Guan had brought him a bottle,   This was really his first time seeing elixirs in this world.   Naturally, he wanted the novelty.   Now that the novelty had passed, he simply put it in his storage bag.   “Where’s Lao Meng? Did he break through to the Qi-refining late stage? Why did only you come back when there were two of you going?” He Song poured a cup of tea for himself and asked casually while smelling the tea fragrance.   Two people went to the Green Wall Immortal City together, but only one person came back.   If it weren’t for his close friendship with Wei Fan, He Song might have thought that Wei Fan had secretly killed someone and taken their treasures.   However, the Qi-Gathering Elixir in his storage bag and Wei Fan’s calm face made this thought linger in He Song’s mind for only a moment.   He immediately dismissed it.bender   Having known each other for so many years, they trusted each other’s   character.   He just didn’t know why Meng Guan didn’t come back with Wei Fan.   Could it be that he was having too much fun in the Immortal City and didn’t want to leave?   He Song looked at Wei Fan with suspicion.   “Lao Meng is still in the Immortal City. After successfully breaking through to the Qi-refining late stage, he told me that he wants to develop within the   Immortal City. The Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion is too small, only the   Immortal City is the place where Qi-refining late stage cultivators should be.”   Facing He Song’s question, Wei Fan’s expression was unclear, and he replied indistinctly..

Chapter 57: Chapter 57: Fighting for Life   Translator: 549690339   Meng Guan’s decision to stay in Immortal City.   When Wei Fan first found out, he actually found it difficult to understand.   He also tried to persuade him.   But.   When Meng Guan told Wei Fan what was in his heart, Wei Fan fell silent.   “Wei, from the moment I left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion three years ago, my fate was already set: either fight to the death to successfully achieve Foundation Establishment, or fall on the road to Foundation Establishment.   There’s no other way.”   “I’m a Five Spirits Roots cultivator, unlike you with your four spirits roots talent. If I follow the normal course of cultivation, I’d be able to get a glimpse of the Foundation Establishment Realm before turning sixty.”   “Although not using the Foundation Establishment Elixir to forcefully break through would make the probability of breaking through to Foundation Establishment very low, it gives me, a Five Spirits Roots cultivator, that little bit more chance of achieving Foundation Establishment.”   “If there is no opportunity, and I don’t fight for it with my life, my cultivation would reach the limit of Qi-refining late stage. That’s why I left Immortal Pavilion and gambled everything.”   “Fortunately, my gamble was right. Now, having broken through the bottleneck of the Qi-refining late stage, the road ahead is smooth. I just need to train as soon as possible and succeed in refining to the ninth- tier Qi Refining stage before turning sixty, then I can explore the Foundation   Establishment Realm.”   “Unfortunately, I squandered my youth and didn’t learn a particular skill. It’s too late to regret it now.”   “Helpless.”   “The Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion is too small. Only in Immortal City can I find enough cultivation resources to hope for a glimpse of the Foundation Establishment Realm before turning sixty.”   “Brother Wei, take care.”   Wei Fan let out a long sigh as he recalled the conversation with Meng Guan after Meng’s breakthrough.   He then recited this passage to He Song.   He Song also fell silent upon hearing this.   Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Second floor   He Song never expected that Meng Guan had already made such a plan three years ago.   Perhaps, from the day he resigned from the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and left Immortal Pavilion, Meng Guan had already made up his mind?   Either break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and become a revered Foundation Establishment Master.   Or fall on the road to the Foundation Establishment Realm, becoming an unattended corpse by the roadside.    There is no other way.   “Ah, it seems that Old Meng has really made up his mind. I hope he has smooth sailing in Immortal City.”   After a long time, He Song picked up the cup of tea on the table, raised it in the direction of Green Wall Immortal City, and then drank it in one gulp.   This cup of tea is a blessing.   Blessing Meng Guan to have smooth sailing in Immortal City.   With his current low level of cultivation, He Song was unable to help Meng Guan. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com  So he could only give his blessings, hoping Meng Guan could achieve his goal.   After all, Meng Guan was the guide of He Song’s previous life, and had done a great favor for the current He Song.   If it weren’t for Meng Guan gifting him the book “Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill”, He Song’s days as a loose cultivator would not have been easy.   Although he couldn’t help for now, he would not be stingy with his blessings.   “Hopefully.”   Wei Fan, who was sitting next to him, shook his head with a smile. Although he felt it would be of little use, he didn’t say a word against it.   Foundation Establishment Realm, it’s not so easy.   The thought flashed through his mind, but Wei Fan didn’t voice it out loud, choosing to keep it in his heart instead.   In the following time.   The two of them, who hadn’t seen each other for months, talked about their experiences during this time.   He Song also gained a better understanding of the distant Green Wall Immortal City.   Green Wall Immortal City.   Under the jurisdiction of the Golden Elixir Great Faction, Thick Earth Sect.   Located more than two thousand miles north of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   In Green Wall Immortal City, there were all sorts of cultivators coming and going like loose cultivators, sect disciples, noble family members, and Immortal Pavilion cultivators. It was a mixed bag.   Even a quarter of the city was specially set aside for mortals to live in.   This was a city where immortals and mortals coexisted.   The mortals in the city were mostly descendants of cultivators and had close ties with cultivators in the city.   They usually made a living by doing things that cultivators were unwilling to do.   Several Foundation Establishment Masters were stationed in the city all year round, ensuring its safety.   Some of these Foundation Establishment Masters belonged to the Thick Earth Sect, others to cultivating families’ ancestral masters, and even some rumored to be loose cultivators who had established their foundation and lived in the city.    The presence of several Foundation Establishment Masters greatly enhanced the security of Green Wall Immortal City.   Masters for the cultivators in the city.   Because no one knows whether the person you unintentionally offend will have a Foundation Establishment Master behind them.   At the same time, it also allowed cultivators who had reached the late stage of Qi-refining and wanted to further step into Foundation Establishment Realm to have the opportunity to climb upwards.   In the Immortal City, there were many more Qi-refining late stage cultivators than in the Immortal Pavilion.   Like Meng Guan, there were quite a few Qi-refining late-stage cultivators in the city who wanted to stay and prepare to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.   However, the huge gap between the Qi-refining stage and Foundation Establishment stopped many people.   Over the years.   These Qi-refining late-stage cultivators usually ran businesses to earn spirit stones, accumulating them.   Firstly, if a Foundation Establishment Elixir appeared at the auction house, they could participate in the bidding.   Secondly, if they couldn’t get the Foundation Establishment Elixir, they could leave the earned spirit stones for their descendants with spirit roots, giving them better chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment.   Thirdly, for those in the late stage of Qi-refining for whom progress was no longer possible, it was necessary to have something to pass the time because long-term stagnation would easily produce inner demons.   Fourthly…   Thus, under the fierce competition of countless late-stage Qi-refining cultivators in Green Wall Immortal City, loose cultivators like Meng Guan would certainly find it easier to obtain cultivation resources than in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   There’s no need to risk their lives, and their personal safety was guaranteed.   Furthermore, due to the large number of late-stage Qi-refining cultivators involved, the resources that could be obtained within the city were even greater.   Meng Guan, staying in Green Wall Immortal City, would probably lead a more comfortable life with his seventh-tier Qi-refining cultivation. At the same time, Meng Guan’s cultivation would also improve rapidly.   Through Wei Fan’s description,   He Song gained a general understanding of Green Wall Immortal City and the cultivators there.   He also had no other opinions about Meng Guan’s decision to stay in Green Wall Immortal City.   He might as well stay.   After all, he would live a comfortable life in the Immortal City.   If something happens in the future and Meng Guan could no longer stay in Immortal City, He Song and Wei Fan, who were in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, could still provide a way out for Meng Guan.   Ultimately,   He Song returned home to continue his cultivation after handing over his duties as the steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion to Wei Fan. It had been several days since he returned from the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   In those days,   He Song’s control of the Fireball Skill had improved leaps and bounds.   This was thanks to his strong soul from crossing over, which made him study skills much faster than ordinary cultivators.   Now,   Since Wei Fan had returned and He Song no longer needed to go to the Spirit Construction Pavilion for duty every day, he naturally went back home to continue his skill cultivation..

Chapter 58: Chapter 58 Another 3 Years   Translator: 549690339   Time flies.   Years pass swiftly like a shuttle.   Days go by one by one, yet the tasks in He Song’s hands do not seem to get any fewer.   Since Wei Fan returned from Green Wall Immortal City, He Song has been immersed in the joy of learning skills.   Fireball Skill.   Light Body Skill.   It took He Song a total of twenty days to master these two basic skills.   These two basic skills are similar to the Spirit Rain Skill and Spirit Arrow Skill.   Naturally, the time required for cultivation would not have much difference.   With a stronger soul as foundation, He Song’s cultivation speed has always been far ahead of other cultivators.   However, while practicing the Fireball Skill and Light Body Skill, even after reaching a proficient level, He Song never forgets to set aside time to practice daily.   Practicing skills helps cultivators deepen their understanding of the skill and to be more comfortable controlling it.   Increase in power.   Time needed for casting is reduced.   These are the extra effects that frequent practice of skills would bring about.   Apart from cultivating these two skills, He Song’s daily cultivation speed is much faster than before. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))  Thanks to the high-quality Qi-Gathering Elixir brought back by Wei Fan on behalf of Meng Guan, He Song’s cultivation speed has become terrifyingly fast when combined with his practice within the Spirit-Gathering Array. Initially, He Song guessed it would take him at least four years to advance from the fourth to the fifth tier of Qi Refining.   However, by being in the Spirit-Gathering Array and taking the Qi-Gathering Elixir, He Song’s cultivation level broke through from the fourth-tier to the fifth-tier of Qi Refining in just three short years.   Although it wasn’t a significant breakthrough in the realm.   Compared to He Song’s original estimation, it was a whole year faster.   Such a rapid increase in cultivation speed both surprised and delighted He Song.   The fully functioning Spirit-Gathering Array, plus the ten Qi-Gathering Elixirs, had surprisingly effective results.    He Song even considered investing all his spirit stones into elixirs to maintain such extremely rapid cultivation speed.   With such a rapid cultivation speed, by the time he reached the Qi-refining late stage, he would definitely be able to obtain even more resources.   Moreover, he could live in the inner courtyard of the Immortal Pavilion, greatly improving his quality of life.   But, after weighing the pros and cons through thoughtful consideration and verification, He Song shook his head and dismissed the idea.   The Qi-Gathering Elixir cost thirty spirit stones per bottle.   With his annual income of ninety spirit stones, he could only afford to buy three bottles of the elixirs per year.   Thirty Qi-Gathering Elixirs would be just enough for one month’s use.   After purchasing three bottles of Qi-Gathering Elixirs, there would be no hope for learning any new skills.   All the spirit stones would go to buying elixirs.   How could any be left for purchasing skills?   If he purchased three bottles of Qi-Gathering Elixir each year without keeping any spirit stones, he might not even be able to afford mortal rice.   In addition to that, after consuming the bottle of Qi-Gathering Elixirs brought back by Wei Fan on Meng Guan’s behalf, He Song discovered that the elixir had side effects, namely elixir poison.   After consuming an entire bottle of Qi-Gathering Elixir, He Song noticed that by the tenth Qi-Gathering Elixir, the elixir’s effect in improving his cultivation had somewhat diminished.   At the same time, when He Song circulated the spirit power within his body, it had become more difficult to mobilize than before.   The ease of controlling the spirit power in his body was significantly different from before.   There was a feeling of obscure obstruction.   However, within a month of taking the elixir, the spirit power in his body returned to its original state.   This confirmed to He Song that after eating a bottle of ten Qi-Gathering Elixirs, the elixir poison in his body would take a month to completely dissipate.   The existence of elixir poison was also the reason why He Song abandoned the idea of taking elixirs to rapidly increase his cultivation level.   Having spirit power that could not be freely controlled and faced with immense resistance in circulation is taboo for cultivators.   If one were to fight with others, such obscure power would hardly be a match for cultivators of the same realm.   Even when breaking through bottlenecks, such obscure power could become a huge hindrance.   At the same time.   Because He Song was constantly in the Spirit-Gathering Array, the obstructed feeling in the circulation of spirit power in his body would slow down the speed at which he absorbed spirit Qi.   As the speed of absorbing spirit Qi decreased, naturally, it would affect the speed of growth of spirit power in his body.    In this way, after the rapid growth of spirit power after taking the elixir, and the loss of spirit power due to the slowed down absorption of spirit Qi within a month after the elixir poison entered the body, they would offset each other.   He Song was astonished to find that his cultivation speed after taking the elixir was only a bit faster than the normal speed of absorbing spirit Qi in the Spirit-Gathering Array.   It couldn’t reach the original expectation at all.   After coming to this conclusion.   He Song completely dismissed the idea of spending all his spirit stones on purchasing elixirs and quickly improving his cultivation level.   Spending all spirit stones on buying elixirs, as opposed to not spending them and just absorbing the spirit Qi in the Spirit-Gathering Array, didn’t make much difference in cultivation speed.   In this case, why bother contributing all his spirit stones to an elixir refiner?   It would be better to use these spirit stones to buy skills, spirit amulets, artifacts, and so on to enhance his own strength.   After all.   He Song was constantly in the Spirit-Gathering Array, and his cultivation speed was much faster than that of ordinary cultivators.   And the Spirit-Gathering Array was the root cause of all this.   If it weren’t for He Song successfully setting up the Spirit-Gathering Array, how could he have had such an extraordinary cultivation speed?   He Song, who was in the Spirit-Gathering Array, usually cultivated much faster than other cultivators.   However, this also meant that taking elixirs didn’t improve his cultivation speed significantly.   This at least saved the cost of buying elixirs.   Now.   Three years have passed.   He Song’s cultivation level has successfully broken through to the fifth -tier of Qi Refining.   He has taken a small step out of the Qi-refining mid-stage, and when he breaks through to the sixth-tier of Qi Refining, he will need to consider whether to take the challenge himself or, like Meng Guan, save spirit stones to go to Green Wall Immortal City to buy Breakthrough Elixirs.   During these three years, He Song has not forgotten to continue studying ‘Array Tao Introduction’.   After three years, and with the experience gained from studying the Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song has thoroughly mastered the Illusion Array in ‘Array Tao Introduction’, and successfully inscribed several Array Foundation techniques required to set up the Illusion Array,   “With the Illusion Array, I can obscure vision, hide my aura, and confuse minds; I don’t have to worry about the spirit field I’ll set up outside being discovered by others. I’m one step closer to opening a spirit field!”   He Song, who had just inscribed all the Array Foundations for the Illusion Array, had a faint smile on his face at this moment.   He spent three fulfilling years cultivating, studying, managing the spirit field, gathering with Wei Fan or other friends, and contacting distant friends with Sound Transmission Skill.   With all these experiences, He Song did not feel too lonely during these three years.   Now, having completed all Array Foundations for the Illusion Array, He Song felt extremely delighted.   However, the next step was to set up the array.   He Song’s face gradually became serious, and his eyes swept across the quiet room, intending to set up the Illusion Array in his own quiet room..

Chapter 59: Chapter 59: Illusion Array   Translator: 549690339   “Setting up the Illusion Array in the quiet room.   An idea that only came to He Song after much contemplation.   Now.   He Song is an Array Path Master, and at the same time, a cultivator at the fifth-tier Qi Refining.   Although outsiders may only see him as an ordinary fourth-tier Qi-refining mid-stage cultivator, He Song’s hidden identity cannot be detected by others.   For example, his identity as an Array Path Master is absolutely not to be revealed to others.   Even his friends, such as Wei Fan, Meng Guan, Zhao Lin, and Lin Cong, have never been informed of this hidden identity.   Some things can only be kept inside.   As an Everlasting being.   He Song must be responsible for his own safety.   He cannot be like other cultivators, who want everyone to know about their achievements as soon as they have any.   He is different from other cultivators.   Setting up the Illusion Array in his own quiet room is a consideration for this purpose.   Illusion Array.   It can shield vision, conceal Qi, and confuse the mind. As the one who sets up the Illusion Array, He Song can even control its range and the functions that he wants to activate.   If it is placed in the quiet room, He Song decided only to activate the Qi concealment function on normal days after pondering for a moment.   As for the shielding vision function, it is not too late to activate it when he is in seclusive cultivation or when there is a need.   When it comes to confusing minds, it is definitely not to be activated in the Immortal Pavilion, as it would draw attention.   Shielding vision is easy to understand.   Outsiders who break into the quiet room will see it as an empty space.   Even if He Song was sitting in the quiet room when an outsider broke in, they wouldn’t be able to see his existence.   While concealing Qi is similar to the Breath Concealment Formulas.   The Illusion Array can hide He Song’s own Qi, making it impossible for intruders to find him, and it can also hide the Qi of the Spirit-Gathering Array.   In the Spirit-Gathering Array, the concentration of spirit Qi is much higher than that of the outside world.   Once someone enters the range covered by the Spirit-Gathering Array, they may instantly detect its existence.   But if the Illusion Array is set up, even if the spirit Qi in the Spirit-Gathering Array is extremely dense, it is still undetectable by other cultivators under the cover of the Illusion Array.   In this way, after activating the two functions of shielding vision and concealing Qi, there would be no need for He Song to hide in the inner circle even if the calamity from six years ago were to happen again.    He just needs to sit in the Illusion Array and he can be safe and secure, without being discovered by any Evil Cultivators.   Of course, if such a situation arises, He Song will definitely activate the most profound function of the Illusion Array.   Confusing Minds.   Once this function is activated, regardless of whether it is a cultivator or an ordinary person, they would unconsciously avoid the range covered by the Illusion Array and leave.   Although it cannot guarantee that they won’t be discovered.   But when they are not on guard, most people won’t detect it.   With the three major functions of the Illusion Array, once it is set up, it can ensure He Song’s safety.   Even outside the Immortal Pavilion, it can keep him safe and sound.   One can say that He Song, who now underst,nds the Spirit-Gathering Array as well as the Illusion Array, can already go outside the Immortal Pavilion and open up his own spirit field.   However, after thinking about it, He Song still gave up the tempting idea.   The combination of the Spirit-Gathering Array and the Illusion Array can indeed make his spirit field worry-free.   However, there is a huge hidden danger.   Only the concealment of the Illusion Array is not enough; he lacks attack and defense methods.   With He Song’s current fifth-tier Oi Refining realm. if he were discovered by   Evil Cultivators by coincidence, most likely, there would only be a dead end waiting for him without the protection of the Five Phases Array.   Moreover, He Song has not yet learned any fast escape techniques so far. If he is trapped in the Illusion Array, he won’t even be able to escape.   First, he has no attack or defense methods.   Second, he has no fast escape techniques.   He Song dare not leave the Immortal Pavilion recklessly.   He can only wait until he can set up the Five Phases Array and learn a fast escape technique before leaving the Immortal Pavilion to execute his plan.   It’s worth mentioning that.   Once an array method is set up, it is not unmovable.   As an Array Path Master, if He Song needs to move later, he can take back all the Array Foundation used in the process and rearrange the array in his new home.   The engraved Array Foundations will not be damaged unless they are subjected to a powerful attack.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels   Except after the rearrangement of the array method, it takes nearly ten days for the array to achieve its maximum power; the rest remains the same.   Even if he needs to leave temporarily, He Song, as an Array Path Master, can instantly dismantle all the arrays in the quiet room, such as the Spirit-Gathering Array or other arrays, and put the Array Foundations into a storage bag.   When he needs to set up the array again, he can take it out at any time and set it up quickly.   In this way, setting up the Illusion Array in the quiet room is not a waste of materials.   After thinking about it.    He Song waved his hand, and the Nine Array Foundations appeared in front of him.   This is the Array Foundation of the Illusion Array.   Compared to the five Array Foundations of the Spirit-Gathering Array, the nine Array Foundations of the Illusion Array are more difficult to engrave and comprehend.   It’s precisely because the Illusion Array is more difficult than the   Spirit-Gathering Array that He Song took a full three years to set it up.   Having had the experience of setting up the Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song’s learning speed for other array methods was much faster than when he first started.   Nevertheless, it took three whole years.   He Song naturally understood the reason.   The Spirit-Gathering Array is the simplest array method, as described in the Array Tao Introduction.   At first, He Song didn’t quite believe it.   But when he set up the Spirit-Gathering Array and began to comprehend the Illusion Array.   He believed it.   It took him three years just to start setting up the Illusion Array.   He glanced at the nine Array Foundations before him.   And then looked at the five Array Foundations on the Spirit-Gathering Array.   He Song shook his head and began to set up the array method with special techniques.   At the same time as setting up the array, He Song also adjusted the range covered by the Illusion Array and the functions activated.   At a certain moment.   A flash of light appeared in the quiet room.   “Success!”   Feening that the Illusion Array enveloped the entire quiet room ana the Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song stopped his work contentedly.   With the successful setup of the Illusion Array, he could not only conceal his form but also hide his Qi.   In this way, if he cultivates or goes into seclusive cultivation in the future, his safety will be greatly enhanced with the activation of the Illusion Array.bender   Of course, during ordinary times, He Song will only activate the Qi concealment function of the Illusion Array.   By activating this function.   After hiding the Qi of the Spirit-Gathering Array.   Even if He Song invited someone to his house, they would be unaware of the existence of the Spirit-Gathering Array in his home.   The Spirit-Gathering Array is always on, but the gathered spirit Qi is confined to the quiet room by He Song.   As soon as someone enters the quiet room and comes into contact with the extremely dense spirit Qi, they will instantly discover the existence of the Spirit-Gathering Array.   It is for this reason.   During the three years when he set up the Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song never brought anyone to his home..

Chapter 60: Chapter 60: The 3-Year Agreement   Translator: 549690339   Now that the Illusion Array has been set up, completely concealing the aura of the Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song couldn’t help but sigh in relief.   With this.   He no longer had to worry about exposing his identity as an Array Path Master.   Now that the Illusion Array was in place, even if He Song brought someone into the quiet room, that person would have no idea they were already enveloped within two Array Skills.   They would never have guessed that the unremarkable He Song in front of them was actually an Array Path Master.   The Illusion Array was successfully set up.   He Song left the quiet room and entered his chamber.   Sitting at his desk, He Song made himself a cup of tea.   The faint aroma of tea filled his room.   It helped He Song’s slightly fatigued spirit gradually recover after setting up the arrays.   He took a gentle sip.   Its unusual taste made He Song slightly puzzled.   But soon enough.   Pinger’s figure suddenly flashed through He Song’s mind.   Ping’er of the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   Three years ago, Ping’er had gifted He Song a box of fine tea.   Three years later, He Song brewed a pot of tea with the leaves from that box in his room.   In the blink of an eye, three years had passed.   He just didn’t know if Ping’er, who had personally delivered the box of tea leaves back then, was available at this moment.   Could he fulfill his promise and invite her to share the tea while he drank   alone?   A three-year gap between invitations did seem quite long.   He Song pondered for a moment, and a thin sheet of paper suddenly appeared in his hand.   “Ping’er my fellow Daoist, three years ago, you gifted an humble person like me a box of fine tea, for which I am deeply grateful. However, I was entangled in mundane affairs, distracting my spirit.”   “When I took out that box of fine tea again, I realized how time flies like an arrow, and years swiftly pass by.”   “In the blink of an eye, three years have gone by.”   “I wonder if you have time now, fellow Daoist. Today, I’m enjoying the tea alone, but I worry that I might disappoint the kindness you have shown me.”   He Song.”   Threads of spirit power seeped from He Song’s fingertips, instantly inscribing lines of words on the thin paper.   After making sure everything was correct, He Song casually pointed at it.   In an instant, a sound-transmitting paper crane soared into the sky, flying towards the distance.   In the distance…Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com    Spirit Skill Pavilion.   On the second floor,   Ping’er, who was in the midst of her usual cultivation, suddenly opened her eyes.   In her beautiful eyes, there was a hint of confusion. She looked at the sound -transmitting paper crane in front of her.   Sound-transmitting paper crane?   In the Immortal Pavilion, Pinger was only familiar with the people from the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   If people from the Spirit Skill Pavilion wanted to find her, they would just come directly.   Why would someone use the Sound Transmission Skill to contact her?   With confusion and puzzlement, Ping’er released a bit of her own Qi.   Immediately, she saw that the once glowing sound-transmitting paper crane instantly transformed into a thin sheet of paper.   As the thin paper fell into her hands, lines of writing immediately appeared.   “So, he’s not dead…”   After finishing the letter, a sudden realization flashed in Ping’er’s eyes.   Three years had passed without seeing him,   She thought that He Song had died somewhere.   Otherwise, in these three years, he should have contacted her.   She knew that the small box of tea leaves she had given away at that time was quite valuable.   But she patiently waited, and He Song’s messages never came.bender   However, reaching out to He Song directly might have made him think she wanted to profit from her kindness, so she didn’t do that.   As a result, three years went by, and deep down, she even thought that her previous efforts were wasted, and He Song, whom she had wanted to befriend, might have already died somewhere.   But now.   Looking at the paper in her hand and the lines of handwriting on it.   She suddenly realized.   It turned out that He Song did not die, but had forgotten about her.   Heartache.   However, she quickly took a deep breath, composed her thoughts, and calmly took out a piece of paper.   “Mr. He has invited me, how can I refuse as a young woman? I don’t know where you are, but I will come immediately.”   “Pinger.”   After receiving Ping’er’s reply, He Song thought about it and decided to set the meeting place in a tea house within the Immortal Pavilion.   “I’ll be waiting for you at the Flowers Tea House.”   However, after releasing the sound-transmitting paper crane, He Song pondered for a moment and quickly placed some Thick Earth Amulet where he could easily pick them up.   He then left and headed straight for the location of the Flowers Tea House.   Inviting someone to his home.   That was absolutely impossible.    Let alone the fact that they had only met three times before, this would make it the fourth meeting.   Even if they had met a hundred and eighty times and become good friends, He Song would think twice before inviting someone to his home.   Now the times are different from the past.   Back then, there were no secrets at home, and inviting someone there was no problem.   Now, with the two Array Skills operating in his home, if someone discovered something suspicious, he would likely be targeted by countless cultivators.   This was a risk He Song did not dare to take.   Flowers Tea House.   Named after its signature Flowers Tea.   Flowers Tea, made from a hundred flower petals with peculiar fragrances.   Once brewed, the floral scent fills the air, as if one is surrounded by a sea of flowers, refreshing both mind and spirit.   When drank, the sweet taste lingers on the lips for three days.   Unfortunately, it is not spirit tea. In the mortal world, Flowers Tea may be worth a fortune.   But in Immortal Pavilion, the price is not too high.   Upon arriving at the Flowers Tea House.   He Song casually entered a private room, and after ordering a pot of Flowers Tea to be set aside, he took out the tea leaves from Ping’er’s box and slowly started to brew the tea.   A moment later.   The scent of tea filled the entire private room.   Ping’er arrived.   Today, Ping’er was no longer dressed in the signature clothes of Spirit Skill Pavilion but instead wore a light green mana robe.   The light green mana robe, along with some ornaments, made Ping’er look very different from He Song’s impressions.   This attire made Ping’er’s already beautiful face even more charming, and her figure even more graceful.   Indeed, clothes make the man.   He Song secretly praised her in his heart, but his face did not reveal anything.   Inviting Ping’er for a drink was just because he suddenly remembered the incident three years ago, and he wanted to see what Ping’er was really up to.   As for the other things, he did have a few questions.   “Mr. He, I’ve waited for a full three years just for this pot of tea.”, said Ping’er as she sat in front of He Song. Her beautiful eyes stared straight at He Song, revealing a pitiful expression.   Three years.   How many sets of three years are there in one’s life?   Looking at He Song leisurely brewing tea in front of her, Ping’er had mixed feelings.   She never expected that she would wait for so long after sending a gift and wanting to make friends, only getting a response after three years.   However, meeting He Song face to face, a glint flashed in Ping’er’s eyes, and her beautiful eyes suddenly took on a hint of surprise.   Her previous dissatisfaction was suppressed by the surprise.   How did this man… improve his cultivation even faster than herself? In just three short years, he had broken through to the fifth-tier Qi Refining stage.   It should be noted that when they met three years ago, He Song had just broken through to the fourth-tier of Qi Refining.   At that time, she could even sense the spirit power fluctuations on He Song’s body due to his recent breakthrough..

Chapter 61: Chapter 61: The Art of Escaping   Translator: 549690339   However, three years have passed, and her cultivation is still at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining, without breaking through to the fifth-tier.   But He Song’s cultivation has already broken through to the fifth-tier of Qi   Refining.   What does this mean?   It means that He Song managed to break through from the fourth-tier to the fifth-tier in just three years.   Such a rapid improvement in cultivation speed made the surprise in Ping’er’s eyes gradually intensify.   His cultivation speed is so fast.   Could it be that the “worldly entanglements” mentioned in the letter are him frantically earning spirit stones?   If so, that seems to make sense.   After imagining all the “hardships” He Song went through in these three years, the slight dissatisfaction in Ping’er’s heart instantly vanished.   What replaced it was a faint sense of joy.   Three years.   Three years of crazy cultivation.   If it were her, she might have been exhausted long ago.   He Song still remembered the agreement he made with her three years ago.   He specifically invited her to the Flowers Tea House for a chat.   As expected, she did not misjudge him.   “I am really sorry, fellow daoist. I have been entangled in worldly matters in the past three years, which has taken up much of my energy and mind. I hope you won’t blame me.”   He Song placed a freshly brewed cup of tea in front of Ping’er, then slightly bowed his hand to her as he spoke.   Worldly entanglements.   Of course, that’s an excuse.

In this way, it could also lessen the grievances in Ping’er’s heart.   Aftor 211 nnt dalihorntolxr awnidino hAr hilt   worldly entanglements.   Only now has he finally fulfilled his promise by inviting her.            “It doesn’t matter, I haven’t lost anything while waiting for your invitation, and since you’ve invited me now, I certainly won’t blame you.”   Smelling the tea fragrance, Ping’er took the teacup in front of her and gently sipped it before shaking her head.   Since she discovered He Song’s cultivation had reached the fifth-tier of Qi Refining, she had already imagined his situation in these three years.   It must have taken He Song a lot of effort to break through from the fourth-tier of Qi Refining to the fifth-tier in three years.   Temporarily forgetting could be considered excusable.   Now that he has sent the invitation, her goal of befriending He Song has been achieved.   Naturally, she wouldn’t say anything weird anymore.   Seeing this, He Song understood that there were no grievances in Ping’er’s heart.   Therefore, with He Song trying to test the waters, and Ping’er looking to befriend him, the conversation between the two quickly became harmonious. As they chatted happily, they both felt their relationship grow closer.   With the teapot emptying, and sensing the timing was right,   He Song remembered his purpose for inviting Ping’er.   “Fellow daoist Ping’er, since you are in charge of the Spirit Skill Pavilion, do you know the quickest escape techniques there?” At a certain moment, He Song asked with a bow.   He Song, who had just set up the Illusion Array, needed such a skill now.   That’s because only with a skill like this can he carry out his next plan.   Since the Illusion Array and Spirit-Gathering Array have been set up, he just needs to set up a Five Phases Array, and then he can personally move beyond the Immortal Pavilion to create his own spirit field.   Before the Five Phases Array is set up, He Song needs to have everything prepared for establishing a spirit field.   Only in this way could He Song create his own spirit field at the fastest speed after setting up the Five Phases Array.   Not to wait until that time to find a solution in a hurry.   At this moment, He Song’s question is the real purpose of inviting Ping’er here.   If it weren’t for this, he might not even have thought of Ping’er in front of him after another three years.   “Quick escape techniques? There are a few; let me think about it.” Ping’er pondered upon hearing this.   But soon, she spoke again.   “The first technique, Mountain Light Body Skill, a mid-level skill with greater speed than the Light Body Skill. Essential for long-distance travel and escape, valued at fifty spirit stones.”   “The second technique, Earth Tunneling Skill, a high-quality skill that allows one to escape underground at incredible speed. However, it should be noted that it is easily countered by the Earthshaking Skill, valued at one hundred spirit stones.”   “The third technique…”   “All these skills are in the Spirit Skill Pavilion; if you need them, you can come with me.”   There are such skills, but outside the Spirit Skill Pavilion, even if she is one of the stewards, she cannot take them out.   The jade slips that record these skills are all made by Foundation Establishment Masters, and their value is extremely high.   They are equivalent to the service of a Foundation Establishment Master, sold only by the Spirit Skill Pavilion.            If one was lost, the Foundation Establishment Master would blame her, and she wouldn’t be able to withstand it.   So she has to suggest He Song come with her to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to make arrangements.   “In that case, I’ll join you.”   When He Song heard this, he nodded and then left the Flowers Tea House with   Pinger.   The two quickly arrived at the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   Spirit Skill Pavilion.   In the VIP room,   Ping’er brewed a pot of spirit tea for He Song and left to fetch the jade slips for him.   He Song casually poured himself a cup, took a nice sip, and suddenly felt an increase in the spirit power within his body.   For a moment, He Song seemed to remember the scene when he first tasted this tea.   This spirit tea, called Green Immortal Spirit Tea, was something He Song had tasted on his second visit to the Spirit Skill Pavilion. It was exclusive to the VIP room.   When He Song first tasted it, he had asked Ping’er about the price of the tea.   He remembered that Ping’er seemed to have mentioned that this Green Immortal Spirit Tea was from the Thick Earth Sect, priced at ten spirit stones per ounce.   Ten spirit stones per ounce.   Not only could the old him not afford to enjoy it, but even now, He Song still could not afford to enjoy it.   It’s too expensive!   With He Song’s current income of ninety spirit stones per year, he can only buy nine ounces of spirit tea per year.   How many times can you drink nine ounces of spirit tea?   He Song didn’t know, and he didn’t want to know either.   Perhaps when he has an abundance of spirit stones in the future, he will buy some Green Immortal Spirit Tea to drink slowly at home and enjoy the refreshing feeling of improving his cultivation simply by drinking tea. But now is not the time.   Soon, Ping’er returned to the VIP room with a tray in her hands.   On the tray, several jade slips were shining brightly, making it impossible to look away.   “Fellow daoist, all the quick escape techniques in the Spirit Skill Pavilion are here. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, and I will answer you to the best of my knowledge.”   Placing the tray in front of He Song, Ping’er assured him.   After their previous conversation, the relationship between the two had begun to grow closer.   Now, at the beginning of their friendship, she would naturally not hide anything from He Song.   She had been wanting to befriend He Song for a long time and was quite satisfied with the current outcome.   “Thank you, fellow daoist Ping’er.”   He Song poured a cup of spirit tea and placed it in front of Ping’er before   thanking her with a smile.   Soon after, He Song’s gaze focused on the jade slips in the tray..        

Chapter 62: Chapter 62: Earth Tunneling Skill   Translator: 549690339   Next to the jade slips on the tray, there was a small booklet for each one.   It recorded the contents of the jade slips.   In the past, when Ping’er was not that familiar with He Song, she would only bring the booklets over.   Only when He Song decided what he wanted to buy, would Ping’er go and fetch the jade slip for him.   Not like now, where all the booklets and jade slips were taken out at once.   As such, it could be seen that Ping’er had quite a bit of trust in He Song.   If He Song were really an Evil Cultivator, just grabbing the jade slips and running, Ping’er would be blamed by the Foundation Establishment Master.   At that time, punishment would be inevitable.   He Song naturally understood this.   He also approved of Ping’er’s actions.   Picking up a small booklet at random, He Song began to look at it quickly.   “First, Light Body Skill, one of the basic skills, can increase walking speed, must-have for long-distance travel and escaping, worth ten spirit stones.”   “Second, Mountain Light Body Skill, a middle-grade technique, faster than Light Body Skill, essential for long-distance travel and escaping, worth fifty spirit stones.”   “Third, Earth Tunneling Skill, a high-quality technique, can tunnel into the ground after casting, travel at extreme speed underground, but be careful as it is easily countered by the Earthshaking Skill, worth one hundred spirit stones.”   “Fourth, Heavenly Cicada Light Body Skill, a high-quality technique, can briefly hover in the air after casting, travel at extremely fast speed, whether it’s for travel or escaping, it is one of the best techniques for Qi Refining stage practitioners, worth one hundred spirit stones.”   “Fifth… ”   Picking up and putting down the booklets inside the tray repeatedly several times,   He Song eventually finished reading all the booklets, having a general idea about these escape techniques.   He Song had already learned the Light Body Skill, which, although it wasn’t slow, wasn’t outrageously fast either, probably because it was only a basic skill.   As for the Mountain Light Body Skill,   According to the descriptions in the booklets, it originated from the Thick Earth Sect and was the most commonly used Light Body Skill among the   Qi-refining mid-stage outer disciples of the sect, its speed being very fast.   Although it was only a middle-grade technique, if it were fully used, it could even catch up to a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator using the Light Body Skill.   However, if a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator had also practiced the Mountain Light Body Skill, it would be a different story.   At the same time, because of its tier, the speed of the Mountain Light Body   Skill should be inferior to the high-quality Heavenly Cicada Light Body Skill.    Of course, the Mountain Light Body Skill was also cheaper than the Heavenly Cicada Light Body Skill.   Then there was the Earth Tunneling Skill.   Tunneling into the ground, traveling at an extremely fast speed underground.   According to the descriptions in the booklets, the speed of the Earth Tunneling Skill was very fast, not quite as fast as the Mountain Light Body Skill during underground travel, but not much slower either.   Moreover, since they were underground, if used with the Breath Concealment Formulas, it would be much safer under the condition that no one detected them, it could be considered a technique for quickly escaping silently.   Lastly, the Heavenly Cicada Light Body Skill.   The origins of this skill were unknown, as there was no record of it in the booklet.   However, its characteristic of allowing them to briefly hover in the air made this Heavenly Cicada Light Body Skill especially popular in the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   Cultivators were also human.   Especially Qi-refining practitioners.   For those who hadn’t stepped into the Foundation Establishment Stage and couldn’t practice the tunneling skills at that stage, they naturally couldn’t turn their bodies into tunneling light and travel through the sky like Foundation Establishment Masters.   In this case, their yearning for the sky was evident.   Can’t transform into tunneling light?   Then use the Heavenly Cicada Light Body Skill to fly!   Even if they could only hover briefly, it was still a wonderful experience.   Moreover, as a high-quality technique, the Heavenly Cicada Light Body Skill itself had a very fast speed, making it quite suitable for Qi-refining late-stage practitioners to use for travel or escaping.   That was the reason for the Heavenly Cicada Light Body Skill’s popularity.   After reading all the booklets, He Song thought for a moment before deciding on the Earth Tunneling Skill.   Safety.   It was the first consideration for He Song.   Neither the Light Body Skill nor the Mountain Light Body Skill, nor even the Heavenly Cicada Light Body Skill, seemed as safe to He Song as the Earth Tunneling Skill.   The Earth Tunneling Skill allowed for traveling underground, not fast, but not slow either, and with the cover of the soil layer, it was obviously safer.   If the Earth Tunneling Skill were used in conjunction with the Breath   Concealment Formulas, as long as they didn’t intentionally pay attention,   who could know that there was a cultivator underground using the Earth Tunneling Skill?   In the future, He Song would definitely have to leave the Immortal Pavilion and go elsewhere to open spirit fields repeatedly.   On the way there and back, he couldn’t guarantee that he wouldn’t attract attention every time.   Using the Light Body Skill himself would make him too conspicuous, making it easy for others to follow him.   Earth Tunneling Skill, on the other hand, allowed him to quietly tunnel underground from his home without anyone noticing his departure, and no one would know where He Song went.    Naturally, the more concealed Earth Tunneling Skill became his first choice.   In addition, in case his spirit field was discovered,   He Song, who would be caught in the middle of it, could use the Earth Tunneling Skill to quietly leave with the help of the Five Phases Array buying him some time.   When using the Earth Tunneling Skill in conjunction with the Breath Concealment Formulas, it would be easy to slip away without any precautions.   Although doing so would cost him a spirit field, at least his life would be safe.   After thinking it over in his mind, He Song gently wiped the table.   Instantly.   One hundred spirit stones appeared on the table in front of him.   “Fellow Daoist Ping’er, I’d like to purchase this Earth Tunneling Skill.” He Song gave the spirit stones and picked up the jade slip with the Earth Tunneling Skill recorded on it.   Seeing Ping’er nodding slightly and taking away the one hundred spirit stones, He Song naturally pressed the jade slip against his forehead.   The next moment.   A huge amount of information poured into He Song’s mind from the jade slip.   Fortunately, He Song’s soul was stronger than ordinary cultivators, so he could quickly organize and classify this information and then firmly imprint it in his memory.   Once he returned home, he would be able to start comprehending the Earth Tunneling Skill.   Soon after,   He Song put the jade slip back on the tray.   Then he looked at Pinger.   “Fellow Daoist Ping’er, I also need the Object Controlling Skills and some other middle-grade techniques. Could you please help me fetch them?”   Object Controlling Skills.   Middle- grade technique.   Worth fifty spirit stones.   He Song had heard about it from Ping’er during his last visit to the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   At that time, Ping’er told him that the Object Controlling Skills were of great use.   Unfortunately, He Song didn’t have much money at that time and couldn’t afford it, so he ended up buying just two basic skills and left with a feeling of disappointment.   Now, three years have passed.   He Song also had some assets, so he naturally thought of this middle-grade technique and wanted to buy it too.   In addition to the Object Controlling Skills, He Song also wanted to buy some other middle-grade techniques, so he asked Ping’er to fetch them all at once so that he could pick and choose.   From the side,   Ping’er saw that He Song had bought the Earth Tunneling Skill and was still not satisfied, and wanted to buy some middle-grade techniques.   Her gaze toward He Song changed instantly.   “Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment, I’ll be right back.”   As she spoke, Ping’er picked up the tray from the table and left, but as she left, she couldn’t help but wonder..DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Chapter 63: Chapter 63: Huge Expenditure   Translator: 549690339   This newfound friend Mr. He was indeed difficult to figure out.   Not only was his cultivation speed remarkable, but he also seemed to have no shortage of spirit stones.   He was able to successfully break through from the fourth-tier of Qi Refining to the fifth-tier in just three years.   After breaking through, he didn’t hesitate to spend so many spirit stones on buying skills.   Did He Song have a powerful backer?   Or was he involved in illicit activities like killing and plundering?   Or perhaps…   Various guesses flashed through Ping’er’s mind, but without essential information, she could hardly deduce anything.   Helpless, she could only retrieve some mid-tier skills and return to He Song’s side.   “Mr. He, here are the Object Controlling Skills and other mid-tier skills you wanted. Take your time to look.”   Placing the tray in front of He Song, Ping’er spoke while keeping her eyes fixed unblinkingly on him.   It was as if she was trying to glean some information from his face.   But at this moment, He Song’s expression was as calm as an ancient well, giving her no chance to see anything.   He casually picked up several booklets from the tray, and his gaze quickly focused on two skills.   The first skill.   Object Controlling Skills.   This skill uses the spirit power within the body to manipulate objects, making it extremely useful for attack, defense, or everyday life.   Even after He Song possesses Artifacts later on, the Object Controlling Skills can still manipulate these Artifacts for attacking. This is also a handy trick for Qi Refining cultivators.   The second skill.   It was an attack skill.   Stone Breaking Finger!   By concentrating the spirit power in one’s fingers and unleashing it with a specific technique, this skill causes astonishing damage.   Compared to the Spirit Arrow Skill He Song initially learned, the mid-tier Stone Breaking Finger has a stronger killing power and a faster casting speed.    With a single finger, the special spirit power can reach ten meters away. With He Song’s current fifth-tier Qi Refining cultivation, he can directly shatter several low-grade Thick Earth Amulets’ defenses.   As for the mid-grade Thick Earth Amulet, due to its incredible defense, even He Song’s current fifth-tier Qi Refining cultivation would require two activations to break through it.   However, as He Song’s cultivation progresses and he becomes more familiar with Stone Breaking Finger, its power and range will also increase.   After obtaining the Earth Tunneling Skill as a quick escape method, He Song chose to make up for his weakness and put attack methods on the agenda.   From now on, as long as He Song fully masters the Earth Tunneling Skill and Stone Breaking Finger to the point that they can be used normally without sacrificing their power, his combat strength will be greatly improved.   For offense, there’s Stone Breaking Finger.   For escape, there’s Earth Tunneling Skill.   For defense, there’s the mid-grade Thick Earth Amulet.   During Qi Refining, unless one has a defensive artifact, no other defensive skill can compare to the effectiveness of the Thick Earth Amulet.   Thick Earth Amulet, a secret spirit amulet of the Thick Earth Sect, enjoys great popularity as a defensive spirit amulet even within the territories of other surrounding Golden Core Sects.   It is easy to imagine the defensive power of a secret spirit amulet from a Golden Elixir Great Faction.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels   Loose cultivators, noble family members, and sect disciples all possess several Thick Earth Amulets for self-protection during the Qi Refining stage.   He Song was no exception, of course.   “Friend Pinger, I need this Object Controlling Skill and Stone Breaking Finger.   Here are 150 spirit stones.”   After making a decision, He Song pointed towards the jade slip for Object Controlling Skills and then the one for Stone Breaking Finger. Next, he casually swiped the table.   Immediately, 150 spirit stones appeared on the table.   Mid-tier skills cost fifty spirit stones.   However, the price of attack skills is doubled.   Therefore, the price of the mid-tier attack skill, Stone Breaking Finger, increased from the original fifty spirit stones to one hundred.   Together, the total came to 150 spirit stones.   Only after Ping’er nodded and collected the spirit stones on the table did He Song pick up the jade slips and put them against his forehead.   Soon enough, He Song had imprinted all information related to Object Controlling Skills and Stone Breaking Finger into his memory.   From now on, all he needs to do is recall slightly, and he can remember these pieces of information.   After completing these tasks, He Song had no intention of lingering in the Spirit Skill Pavilion any longer. After engaging in casual conversation with Ping’er, he took his leave.   Upon leaving the Spirit Skill Pavilion, He Song couldn’t help but sigh when sensing the only remaining dozen spirit stones in his storage bag.    Three years.   In three years, He Song could earn ninety spirit stones every year, making a total of 270 spirit stones in three years.   Living frugally, coupled with already having some spirit stones saved up, he had managed to accumulate over two hundred spirit stones.   However, he had just spent a large portion of his savings on three skills, causing his three-year savings to dwindle.   “There’s never enough spirit stones.”   Sighing inwardly, He Song glanced back at the towering Spirit Skill Pavilion, feeling that it would be best to avoid this place as much as possible in the future.   Every time he visited the Spirit Skill Pavilion in the past decade, his wealth would suffer a great loss.   The first time he came to the Spirit Skill Pavilion, he had over thirty spirit stones and spent thirty on purchasing three basic skills.   His second visit involved carrying over one hundred spirit stones and buying the Array Tao Introduction, costing him another hundred spirit stones.   On the third visit, with over thirty spirit stones, he bought two basic skills, spending another twenty spirit stones.   The fourth time, his current visit, he had an abundance of over two hundred spirit stones.   And yet, he ended up spending 250 spirit stones on three skills.   Well…   True Immortal Pavilion earns the money, and True Immortal Pavilion spends it. So it seems nothing can be taken home?   Although his income has increased, his spending on spirit stones has soared as well.   However, since he has made ample preparations, he should be able to break free from this difficult situation soon.   As long as he can establish his spirit field, his income will surely skyrocket.   By then, life won’t be as tight as it is now.   Finally, after one last deep glance at the Spirit Skill Pavilion, He Song turned towards his home and walked away.   Despite being costly, the Spirit Skill Pavilion was able to fulfill He Song’s needs.   Whether it was basic skills, mid-tier skills, or high-quality Earth Tunneling Skills, they all catered to his immediate requirements.bender   If he comes again next time, He Song believes that he must be better prepared with more spirit stones.   Returning home, He Song activated the Illusion Array and began practicing his skills under the rich spirit Qi gathered by the Spirit-Gathering Array.   After some deliberation, He Song chose to practice the Object Controlling Skills first.   Before that, Ping’er had mentioned that the scope of use for the Object Controlling Skills was vast.   Whether it was combat, escape, or daily life, Object Controlling Skills could play a significant role.   Therefore, when He Song spent a month mastering the Object Controlling Skills to the point where he could use them freely without diminishing their power, his understanding of the skill deepened further..

Chapter 64: Chapter 64: A Late Reward   Translator: 549690339   Object Controlling Skills, manipulating one’s spirit power to separate from their body, and controlling objects.   Under He Song’s manipulation, anything from tables and chairs to teacups and tea leaves could be controlled like extensions of his own limbs within a range of about 30 meters after being enveloped with spirit power.   If controlling Artifacts in the future, he was afraid the distance would be the same.   A cultivator at the Qi-refining mid stage can project their spirit power at most about 30 meters away from their body.   Of course, the attack range is basically within 30 meters, and the distance of spirit power projection will increase substantially as their cultivation level increases.   Therefore, He Song’s control of objects within 30 meters with his spirit power was considered normal.   30 meters distance isn’t far, but it isn’t near either.   At the Qi-refining late stage, the distance will increase somewhat, probably around 60 meters.   At the Foundation Establishment Stage, it’s controlled by divine sense. The distance covered by divine sense scanning in the Foundation Establishment Early Stage is about 2 kilometers.   Such a huge gap gives Qi-refining late-stage cultivators a significant advantage when facing Qi-refining mid-stage cultivators. Whether it’s ambush or pursuit, they held a longer advantage.   As for Foundation Establishment Masters:   If surrounded by a group of Qi Refining stage cultivators.   Even if all the attackers were at the Qi-refining late stage.   There would still be no chance for victory.   When controlling Artifacts to attack with divine sense, a Foundation   Establishment Master would he able to kill however many Oi Refining   cultivators come, killing one at the Qi-refining late stage would be even easier than killing a small chick.   For Qi Refining stage cultivators:   Within 2 kilometers, Foundation Establishment Masters were like the sky above.   This is also why there is basically only one Foundation Establishment Master guarding each Immortal Pavilion.   Having a Foundation Establishment Master there, Evil Cultivators wouldn’t dare to attack the Immortal Pavilion directly, only daring to do small things on the outside. Naturally, the Immortal Pavilion wouldn’t need to arrange a   Defensive Array.   It would be too costly.   On the periphery of the Immortal Pavilion, where the divine senses of Foundation Establishment Masters couldn’t reach, they only needed to dispatch the Law Enforcement Team to patrol.   With a Foundation Establishment Master in place, the Immortal Pavilion couldn’t fall into chaos.   Any movement, and the wrath of the Foundation Establishment Master would come.   Only the Immortal City would arrange a Defensive Great Array, but it wouldn’t be activated all the time.   Of course:   This refers only to the ultimate attack range.            Under the vast majority of circumstances, even when Foundation Establishment Masters fought, they wouldn’t start attacking each other with a 2-kilometer gap.   Even late-stage Qi-refining cultivators wouldn’t launch an attack from such a distance.   Fights and battles between cultivators required accuracy too.   Apart from Object Controlling Skills:   The second skill He Song practiced was Stone Breaking Finger.   Object Controlling Skills and Stone Breaking Finger are both intermediate skills.   Since he could freely cast Object Controlling Skills without diminishing power after only a month, it should be reasonable that Stone Breaking Finger wouldn’t be far off either.   Nothing happened unexpectedly:   Another month later:   He Song activated Stone Breaking Finger and pointed out.   A golden light suddenly shot out from He Song’s finger and landed directly on the floor of the room.   He Song only felt a flash of golden light before his eyes and the golden light shot out from his fingertips had disappeared into the darkness underground.   On the floor, only a pitch-black little hole remained, and it was unknown how deep it went.   But in He Song’s opinion, it must be deeper than the small hole created by the Spiritual Arrow Skill.   To be noted:   The Spiritual Arrow Skill is just a small skill in killing spirit field pests.   It can’t even be considered a basic skill.   On the other hand, Stone Breaking Finger?   Stone Breaking Finger is an intermediate attack skill!   It cost He Song a hundred spirit stones to purchase it from the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   The power of these two skills could be easily imagined, and there was no comparability.   However. since he was in the Immortal Pavilion. He Song couldn’t test the   specific power of the Stone Breaking Finger.   Left with no choice, after he could freely cast Stone Breaking Finger without losing power each day, he devoted some time to practicing and then started using the rest of his time to practice Earth Tunneling Skill, the one high-quality skill he had left to learn!   Earth Tunneling Skill:   It was the only high-quality skill He Song had purchased.   When cast, it allowed the user to travel in the ground at an extremely fast speed.   It was also the key skill He Song relied on when he was out cultivating spirit fields.   As soon as He Song started to learn it, he immediately felt that Earth Tunneling Skill was abstruse and difficult to understand; it might not be something he could learn within a short period of time.bender   However, even so:   He still practiced Earth Tunneling Skill every day in the hopes of mastering it swiftly.            Yet:   While He Song was engrossed in studying Earth Tunneling Skill and couldn’t extricate himself, the surprise visit of a person broke the calmness of his original life.   In the third month after He Song got the three skills from the Spirit Skill Pavilion:   One day:   “Mr. He, quickly open the door. I’ve brought your reward.” Zhao Lin’s voice came from outside the house, causing He Song, who was still practicing Earth Tunneling Skill, to open his eyes suddenly.   Zhao Lin was the connection He Song left behind when Meng Guan went to the Red Spirit Gold Mine to mine.   When He Song had just broken through to the Qi-refining mid stage, it was Zhao Lin who kindly helped him with the matter of adding new spirit fields, which allowed him to save a lot of time each day.   However, it also made Chen Zhou hate He Song. In the end, He Song had no choice but to send Chen Zhou to Yama’s place.   He came today to see himself and even said it was to give out a reward?   What reward?   Full of doubts, He Song opened the door and welcomed Zhao Lin in.   After more than three years, the relationship between He Song and Zhao Lin hadn’t become strange; instead, they had become more familiar since both were in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   As the two were already good friends, and now they were even closer. With the Illusion Array hiding the two arrays inside the room, He Song didn’t worry about being discovered and didn’t refuse Zhao Lin to enter his residence.   But just as He Song led Zhao Lin into the room, a flash of inspiration appeared in his mind.   He remembered!   Before sending Chen Zhou to see Yama, He Song had informed Zhao Lin in advance and asked him to remove Chen Zhou’s name from the list of spiritual plant farmers. Zhao Lin said at that time:   He said that Chen Zhou had bullied the weak, extorted spirit stones, and committed all kinds of evils; ridding of him by He Song was considered a great merit. He wanted to apply for a merit reward for He Song and said he would personally deliver the reward to He Song’s doorstep.   Originally, after three years had passed, Zhao Lin didn’t get to apply for the reward, so He Song gradually forgot about it.   He thought that Zhao Lin was not careful enough at work.   Little did he expect that after several years, Zhao Lin would indeed bring him the reward today?   This… was a complete surprise!   Thinking of this, He Song looked at Zhao Lin with a hint of interest in his eyes.   The delayed reward for three years:   Finally arrived today.   He just didn’t know what the reward was.   He Song didn’t rush it, and though he was curious in his heart, he didn’t ask directly.   Instead, after welcoming Zhao Lin into the room, he leisurely started to make a pot of good tea for him.   When the room was filled with the aroma of tea, He Song then asked:   “Fellow Daoist, where does this reward come from? As far as I know, though   I’m a spiritual plant farmer, I don’t think I’ve made any contributions to the   Immortal Pavilion. Why would there be a reward?”   Telling lies with his eyes wide open, He Song was indeed an expert.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m   Although he had already remembered where the reward came from, He Song simply pretended that he didn’t recall it..

Chapter 65: Chapter 65: Internal News   Translator: 549690339   After all, this matter couldn’t be out in the open.   The reward was also personally applied for by Zhao Lin for He Song.   This belated credit naturally had to be spoken by Zhao Lin himself to make it seem even more cherished.   He Song, who had been friends with Zhao Lin for several years, had some understanding of the character of his friend before him.   A word of gratitude from him would make Zhao Lin happy for a long time.   However.   It was He Song who had someone kill an Immortal Pavilion cultivator who wanted to harm him.   As a result, after Zhao Lin’s operation, it became He Song who had rooted out the Evil Cultivator hidden in the Immortal Pavilion.   And even applied for a reward on this basis.   This… if it weren’t for the fact that he was manipulating everything, He Song might have believed his nonsense.   So considerate of himself.   It was only natural for He Song not to skimp on just a word of gratitude to Zhao Lin.   “Fellow Daoist is being too modest. As a spiritual plant farmer, it means you are working for the Immortal Pavilion, and your contributions will naturally be noted by the Immortal Pavilion. There’s no such thing as no contribution.”   Shaking his head, Zhao Lin affirmed He Song’s contribution to the Immortal Pavilion.   Meanwhile, his right hand wiped the table.   Immediately, a delicate small box appeared in front of He Song.   “Fellow Daoist often forget things. Three years ago, you eliminated a great harm for the Immortal Pavilion. Such merit cannot be said to be without contribution. Now, the Immortal Pavilion has issued a reward, and I naturally have to deliver it personally.”   Zhao Lin pushed the small box in front of him towards He Song, and his face was filled with a smile, but he did not mention his efforts in this matter.   Three years ago.   When the sound-transmitting paper crane released by He Song fell into his hands.   The hint of Qi-refining late stage energy contained in it had greatly shocked him at the time.   Not until then.   Did he finally understand.   Why Meng Guan had specially instructed him to hang out with He Song before leaving.   Not until then.   Did he finally understand.   Why He Song was able to come to his door on the day Meng Guan left, bringing gifts and making friends.   Not until then… did everything seem to have an answer.    That was one reason why he had agreed so readily back then.   Although he was naturally cautious, he was already friends with He Song three years ago, and naturally would be even more cautious when facing a matter that could affect one’s life and death.   Worried about retaliation from Chen Zhou afterwards.   Worried about being held accountable by the Immortal Pavilion afterwards.   Worried…   But.   When he sensed the breath of a Qi-refining late stage cultivator on the sound -transmitting paper crane released by He Song, his doubts disappeared. With a Qi-refining late stage cultivator taking action, Chen Zhou was bound to die!   In the absence of any worries, and also being able to make good impressions with He Song.   Even if he was cautious by nature, he couldn’t refuse this matter.   And that was also why he had agreed so readily back then and even specially applied for a reward for He Song.   He knew that with this Qi-refining late stage cultivator, this matter would definitely succeed!   Now.   The matter had indeed succeeded.   Although three years had passed, he still delivered the reward to He Song’s hands for the first time as he had said back then.   “So that’s the reason. Thanks to Fellow Daoist’s help for this matter, without your help, there might have been complications. I have to thank Fellow Daoist first.   Hearing this, He Song’s face instantly showed an appropriately astounded expression.   And while thanking him, he also stood up and cupped his hands towards Zhao Lin to show his gratitude.   He Song naturally acted like this.   He took the benefit himself.   Naturally, he had to express his gratitude to the good friend who had helped him with the matter, and show his appreciative attitude.   People should give and take, they give real benefits, and naturally, you should also give something in return.   Not to mention more, you must at least show an appreciative attitude.   He didn’t know what was in that little box, but even if it was just a few spirit stones, he still gained from it.   A few words of gratitude could earn a few spirit stones.   SUCH good fortune, if it were to be known, many cultivators would be bleeding for it.   “It’s a small matter, it’s just a small matter fellow Daoist. Being able to help you, I am already very happy.” Zhao Lin’s face was smiling as he hurriedly returned the greeting.   But looking at the laughter between his eyebrows, He Song knew that Zhao Lin’s mood was very good at this moment.   Seeing this, He Song suddenly understood that his goal had been achieved.   In the next few days.   Zhao Lin’s mood would probably be very good.    As for this, He Song was naturally happy to see it happen.   He got the benefits.   His friend got a good mood.   It was the best of both worlds.   He Song accepted the small box, and Zhao Lin’s purpose of coming here was achieved.   Next, the two naturally began to chat casually.   “Fellow Daoist, do you know why the reward had to come at this time, not earlier or later?” After a few cups of tea, Zhao Lin lowered his voice and spoke mysteriously.   From his words, it seemed that there was some secret hidden within.   He Song was intrigued and immediately became interested in the matter.   Right.   It has been three years.   In these three years, He Song had almost forgotten about it.   Why did the reward suddenly come through?   Looking at Zhao Lin’s mysterious appearance, He Song suddenly realized that what Zhao Lin was about to say next must have something to do with this matter.   However.   To get Zhao Lin to explain in detail. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m  He had to ask first.   “I don’t know about this. Does Fellow Daoist have any inside information?” Shaking his head, He Song also lowered his voice and asked.   On the side, seeing He Song playing by the rules, Zhao Lin’s face immediately showed a fleeting joy.   Since he had received this secret information, he had never told anyone about it, and had kept it bottled up in his heart.   The feeling of knowing a secret.   But not being able to share it with others.   It was a little uncomfortable.   Now, by personally delivering the reward to He Song, he could finally talk freely.   After all, this is the outer area of the Immortal Pavilion, even if this information is heard by someone, it won’t harm anything.   With his mind made up, Zhao Lin began to speak. “Fellow Daoist, do you remember the cultivator named Chen Zhou three years   He Song nodded and gestured for Zhao Lin to continue.   “Since Fellow Daoist remembers, you should also remember the reason why I asked for credit for you back then.”   Taking a light sip from his teacup, Zhao Lin’s voice sounded again.   “At that time, when I asked for credit for Fellow Daoist, I said that Chen Zhou bullied the weak and extorted spirit stones every day, committing all kinds of evil deeds, and his crimes were extremely heinous.”   Saying this, Zhao Lin looked at He Song with a hint of sentiment on his face.   Then he shook his head and continued speaking in detail.   “This matter actually has a reason.”   “Six years ago, after the Immortal Pavilion suffered a great calamity, the low-level cultivators of the Immortal Pavilion were almost cut off. Most of the surviving cultivators had means to not suffer hardship in that calamity..”

Chapter 66: Chapter 66: Law Enforcement in Immortal City   Translator: 549690339   “The remaining first-tier Qi Refining cultivators are far from enough to maintain the normal operation of the Immortal Pavilion. Therefore, the Upper Leader ordered the recruitment of loose cultivators to join the Immortal   Pavilion and ensure its normal operation.”   “Chen Zhou joined the Immortal Pavilion during that time, through my introduction.”   “Regarding the Chen Zhou incident, I admit it was my fault that has caused you some trouble.”   While saying this, Zhao Lin gave He Song a bow, taking the blame.   Because of this, he was originally very eager to fight for more benefits for He Song.   Although he did help in the matter of Chen Zhou, he still felt somewhat guilty in his heart.   He Song didn’t mind.   He waved his hand, indicating that the matter was over, and there was no need to mention it again.   Seeing this, Zhao Lin relaxed and continued to speak.   “After experiencing the Chen Zhou incident, you should understand the significant difference between loose cultivators and the cultivators of our Immortal Pavilion. Loose cultivators have eccentric personalities and do things unscrupulously, while cultivators of the Immortal Pavilion are not like that.”   “Recruiting loose cultivators to join the Immortal Pavilion is an act born out of necessity. Only in this way can we maintain the normal operation of the Immortal Pavilion.”   “However, six years have passed, and many loose cultivators who have just stepped into the first-tier Qi Refining stage have entered the Immortal Pavilion from the mortal world. Now, the number of people within the   Immortal Pavilion is enough to maintain its normal operation.”   “Even the Upper Leader has specifically instructed to recruit more loose cultivators who have just entered the Cultivation World.”   “As a result, the loose cultivators who were recruited six years ago have become unstable factors within the Immortal Pavilion.”   At this time,   Zhao Lin paused in his speech and looked at He Song.   But He Song, at this moment, was already lost in thought while holding his teacup.   Seeing this, Zhao Lin did not rush to tell He Song the internal information he had learned. Instead, he slowly drank tea from his cup, like He Song.   Inside the room,   It suddenly became extremely quiet.   Only wisps of tea fragranceoverflowed from the teapot, drifting continuously through the room.    After a long time,   He Song put down his teacup and sighed softly.   “It seems someone wants to take action against these loose cultivators.”   In the past, when he learned from Wei Fan that Chen Zhou bullied the weak, extorted spirit stones and committed countless terrible actions, He Song had already guessed this.   Regardless of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion or other Immortal Pavilions,   Their entire existence is to serve the sects they belong to.   The existence of the Immortal Pavilion can not only gather loose cultivators who have just entered the Cultivation World for easy management,   but also select some morally upright talents from these loose cultivators to join the Immortal Pavilion and become cultivators within the Immortal Pavilion.   Loose cultivators who don’t pass the selection are left to fend for themselves. Their deaths have nothing to do with the Immortal Pavilion, no matter where they die.   This is also the reason why the rent for the Immortal Pavilion is so expensive.   Upwards in the Immortal Pavilion hierarchy, they do not care whether loose cultivators can live in the Immortal Pavilion or obtain enough resources; they only care about the cultivators within the Immortal Pavilion.   As for the high-ranking members of the sect, they do not care about the life and death of loose cultivators and Immortal Pavilion cultivators. In their eyes, only the disciples of the sect are the hope for the sect’s inheritance.   One could say that the cultivators of the Immortal Pavilion are, in a way, alternative sect disciples.   However, compared to the better gifted sect disciples, Immortal Pavilion cultivators need to rely on their own efforts to continue cultivation. At the same time, they also don’t have much support and only have some power within the Immortal Pavilion, but the sect does not recognize them.   Sect disciples, on the other hand, don’t need to perform miscellaneous tasks daily and can focus solely on cultivation.   After being selected as an internal cultivator of the Immortal Pavilion, they can continue to cultivate in a stable environment. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎  Qi Refining Early Stage, Qi-refining mid stage, and even Qi-refining late stage.   When these morally upright and promising talents reach the Qi-refining late stage, they need to join the other loose cultivators who have barely reached the Qi-refining late stage and begin to contribute to the sect.   Almost all cultivation skills released by sects or aristocratic families will have a catch when cultivating to the Qi-refining late stage. You need to purchase unique resources from within the sect to make rapid progress.   This is also the reason why Meng Guan needed to earn enough resources in Green Wall Immortal City when he stepped into the Qi-refining late stage.   Whether they are Qi-refining late-stage loose cultivators,   Or Qi-refining late-stage Immortal Pavilion cultivators,   Both need to purchase Crumbled Jade Powder produced by Thick Earth Sect to speed up their cultivation progress during the Qi-refining late stage.   Don’t want to buy? Then watch as others progress quickly, while your own cultivation speed remains as slow as a snail.   Therefore, one can constantly earn spirit stones from loose cultivators and Immortal Pavilion cultivators.   At the same time, after cultivating the sect’s cultivation skill, once a loose cultivator or an Immortal Pavilion cultivator luckily breaks through Foundation Establishment, joining the sect becomes their best choice.    No need to change their cultivation skill, leave their hometown, and there are even higher-level cultivation skills available within the sect.   In this way, the temptation to loose cultivators for Foundation Establishment and Immortal Pavilion cultivators for Foundation Establishment is extremely great.   In this closely-connected situation, the sect can ensure that all Building Foundation cultivators within the sphere of influence of the sect can join the sect, and that there will be no instances of newly broke through Foundation Establishment cultivators running to rival sects.   Under such premise,   the sect naturally prefers to acquire a morally upright Foundation Establishment cultivator with great affection for the sect.   Rather than an eccentric, indifferent-to-the-sect loose cultivator for Foundation Establishment.   Now,   Since the internal cultivators of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion are enough to operate the Immortal Pavilion,   Those eccentric loose cultivators, who still act on their own after becoming Immortal Pavilion cultivators, can only be eliminated.   They can’t let one rotten apple spoil the whole barrel.   The existence of the Immortal Pavilion is the foundation of the sect’s power.   In the past, they were left unchecked because they didn’t cause much destruction, and the Immortal Pavilion needed to operate, so it had to resort to such a strategy.   But now, the number of Immortal Pavilion cultivators is enough to support the operation of the Immortal Pavilion.   Such corrupt practices can’t be allowed to continue!   “Yes, this time, it was initiated by the Immortal Pavilion’s higher-ups and led by Green Wall Immortal City. Cultivators of the Immortal City Law   Enforcement Team were sent to various Immortal Pavilions to investigate those notorious cultivators.”   “In this way, your rewards can be applied for, and the atmosphere in the Immortal Pavilion will return to its past state.”   Seeing that He Song already guessed, Zhao Lin no longer kept it a secret but revealed everything with a sigh.   The information he received was just that.   According to the speed of Qi Refining cultivators, it is expected that the cultivators of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team will arrive at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion soon.   By then… there will likely be a bloody storm within the Immortal Pavilion.   However, this can be considered a good thing as well.   At least after that, the atmosphere in the Immortal Pavilion will improve significantly.   Moreover,   This action is aimed at those notorious cultivators who joined the Immortal Pavilion six years ago.   For him, He Song, and even those cultivators who have been obeying the rules since joining the Immortal Pavilion, there is no target. Naturally, he doesn’t have to worry about anything either.   “Notorious cultivators?   Sitting next to him, He Song was shocked after hearing Zhao Lin’s words.   Immediately afterward, images of what he had seen in his previous life appeared in his mind..

Chapter 67: Chapter 67: Early Preparation   Translator: 549690339Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   Theres nothing new under the sun.   Such a scene made it hard for He Song not to think of something.   What kind of cultivator could be called notorious?   Who would determine?   Who would execute?   Perhaps, only the members of the Law Enforcement Team from Immortal City have such authority.   But who can guarantee that those members of the Law Enforcement Team from Immortal City wont be blinded by greed, killing the innocent, taking credit and seizing resources for themselves?   Keep in mind.   They, coming from Immortal City, have great power and their cultivation is probably not low.   If they really want to do something, the cultivators living on the outskirts of Immortal Pavilion would not be able to resist.   At that time   He Songs face darkened slightly, feeling a sudden cold sweat on his back.   If such a situation were to occur, would the wealthy cultivators of Immortal Pavilion, those without a background, or even himself become notorious cultivators?   With power in hand, the members of the Law Enforcement Team from Immortal City can determine at will; naturally, who is considered a notorious cultivator depends entirely on their mood.   Taking advantage of the opportunity to seize resources wouldnt be impossible either.   He Song looked at Zhao Lin beside him.   After thinking for a while, He Song decided to give him a reminder.   Taoist friend, when that time comes, who will be considered a notorious cultivator?   A faint voice echoed, but He Songs heart was already filled with the idea of leaving Immortal Pavilion immediately and returning only after the people from the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team had left.   Now.   He Song had already mastered two Array Skills and practiced some self-protection skills.   Apart from lacking Artifacts and being slightly inadequate in spirit amulets, He Songs fifth-tier Qi Refining cultivation meant he only needed to be careful while walking outside, or set up an Illusion Array and hide inside it to ensure safety.   This time, he didnt have to rely on his friends like the last time when the great disaster struck; his low cultivation and inability to give up the benefits of Immortal Pavilion forced him to hide in his friends house and leave his fate to the heavens.   With his face showing no signs, He Song began to plan his next move in his heart.   However.   With He Songs reminder, Zhao Lin finally realized the implications.   Dao friend, do you mean Zhao Lins expression changed in an instant from surprise to contemplative, and then to horror.   When Meng Guan introduced Zhao Lin to He Song as a contact, he mentioned that Zhao Lins character was cautious, quite similar to He Song.    And precisely because Zhao Lins character was relatively cautious.   After hearing He Songs reminder, he could understand He Songs meaning right away.   Thats right!   When that time comes.   Who would be those notorious cultivators?   It could be wealthy Loose cultivators, real notorious cultivators or, even more likely, someone who is deemed notorious simply because they are displeasing or advantageous to be killed.   Such a method would not only cleanse Immortal Pavilion of notorious cultivators but also allow them to take advantage of their newly acquired power to quickly fill their own pockets.   Which member of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team could resist such a temptation?   Bear in mind, Zhao Lin was an amulet Tao master, with considerable wealth.   If something were to happen, he would likely be the first target.   Having understood this, Zhao Lins once joyful face immediately turned serious.   Before He Songs reminder, he was still immersed in the imaginary improvement of Immortal Pavilions atmosphere, completely unaware of the impending crisis.   Not until this moment.   Only under extreme fear did he finally react.   Dao friend, I will be leaving Immortal Pavilion soon to travel outside. If you have any connections, could you entrust someone to manage my spirit field? I am willing to pay thirty spirit stones as a reward.   Seeing Zhao Lins rapid change of expression, He Song timely clasped his hands and spoke.   Run!   Must run!   Now! Run right away!   He Song had already decided not to return to this haunted place until the people from the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team leave.   If he stayed in Immortal Pavilion, nobody would know whose side would come out on top- the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team or his own powerful backing.   Instead of living in fear, its better to turn around and leave.   As long as his spirit field is still being managed, he wont lose his identity as a spiritual plant farmer.   He could come back after the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team leaves.   By then.   Life would go on as usual.   Thank you, fellow Daoist, for your advice. Rest assured about the spirit field matter, I will arrange it properly. I shall take my leave now. Zhao Lin deeply saluted He Song, then turned and left.   Seeing his hurried manner, it seemed as if he was afraid he wouldnt be able to leave the next moment.   Back in the room.   Seeing Zhao Lin running away, He Song immediately closed the door.    He entered the quiet room.   He Song made a hand seal and cast a spell.   Suddenly.   Streams of light flew from various parts of the quiet room towards He Song, landing on his hand.   When the light disappeared, He Songs hand held fourteen Array Foundations.   Five Spirit-Gathering Arrays.   Nine Illusion Arrays.   A total of fourteen Array Foundations were all in his hand.   As long as he had these Array Foundations, he could set up the two arrays elsewhere.bender   Although it would take about ten days to re-establish the arrays to achieve maximum efficiency.   At this moment, with the urgency of the situation, He Song couldnt care less.   Storing all the Array Foundations in his storage bag, He Song quickly began to pack up other things.   However, due to the limited space in the storage bag, he could only bring some valuable items such as tea sets, tea leaves, and spirit rice.   Once the storage bag was packed full, a thin piece of paper appeared in He Songs hand.   Wei, Ive received news that the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team will be arriving at Immortal Pavilion soon to eliminate notorious cultivators.   But the definition of notorious depends solely on the Immortal City Law Enforcement Teams decision.   This is a serious matter, so I plan to leave Immortal Pavilion temporarily and return after the law enforcement team has left.   Please be prepared, Wei.   He Song.   With a display of spirit power, the thin paper in He Songs hands transformed into a sound-transmitting paper crane and flew into the sky. At the same time, He Song stepped out of the door.   This moment.   The blazing sun was high in the sky,   The scorching sunlight fell on He Song, but it did not bring him any warmth.   On the contrary, his speculations in his mind made him feel chills to the bottom of his heart.   This matter was of great importance.   If he had been too suspicious.   Then it would be fine, at least it meant that the higher-ups of Immortal Pavilion would have some restraint over the incoming Law Enforcement Team from Immortal City.   But if everything was as he predicted   He Song shook his head, casting aside the shuddering feeling in his heart.   Anyway, he had already left, and whatever happened in Immortal Pavilion had nothing to do with him.   With the Light Body Skill activated, He Song quickly rushed out of Immortal Pavilion, heading towards the endless mountains in the distance..

Chapter 68: Chapter 68: Leaving the Immortal Pavilion   Translator: 549690339   The Light Body Skill was not fast.   But that was relative to other cultivators.   For ordinary people, a cultivator at the Qi-refining mid stage using the Light Body Skill to gallop away was much faster than the mortal worlds fastest horse.   Traveling a thousand miles a day was nothing special.   He left the Immortal Pavilion.   He Songs arm retracted into his sleeve, his fingertips tightly gripping several Thick Earth Amulets, as he moved swiftly in the northwest direction with a serious expression.   Green Wall Immortal City was located directly north of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   If he were to go directly north, he might just run into the Law Enforcement Team cultivators from the Immortal City head-on.   By then, it might be like a sheep entering a tigers den.   Thats why He Song chose the northwest direction, where there were no Immortal Pavilions or Immortal Cities, making it the best direction to avoid other cultivators.   He Song had seen the surrounding map in the Spirit Skill Pavilion of the Immortal Pavilion.   The closest Immortal Pavilion to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was several hundred miles away.   In all directions, there were no Immortal Pavilions or Immortal Cities in the northwest.   As such, He Song didnt need to worry about coming face to face with other cultivators.   And the northwest direction was where He Song planned early on to open a spirit field.   The Cultivation World had its roots in the mortal world.   There were countless connections between the mortal world and the Cultivation World, with the majority of loose cultivators coming from the former.   However, the relationship between ordinary people and cultivators was mostly that of not meddling in each others affairs.   Cultivators rarely ventured into the mortal world.   Thats because the spirit Qi in the mortal world was scarce, and unless one was skilled in array tao and could set up a Spirit-Gathering Array among the mortals, a cultivators cultivation speed in the mortal world would be exceedingly slow, and obtaining spirit stones would become much more difficult.   Under this premise, cultivators who went to live in the mortal world generally did so for reasons such as having no hope of making a breakthrough, their lifespan nearing its end, lack of ambition, or craving for wealth and prestige.   There were not many cultivators like this, but there were still quite a few, and their presence could often be seen in the worldly affairs.   However, it was quite difficult for ordinary people to come across cultivators.   Cultivators walking in the mortal world generally remained hidden, living freely and happily, without much contact with ordinary people.   They usually socialized with the royalty and nobles of the worldly dynasties, enjoying wealth and luxury.   Although Immortal Pavilions did not prohibit ordinary people from coming, they were usually situated deep in the mountains, concealed and surrounded by fierce beasts and poisonous insects, making it difficult for ordinary people to reach them.    Therefore, only a very few ordinary people could enter the Immortal Pavilions.   Only the areas where Immortal Cities were located would have large numbers of ordinary people.   Outside the Immortal Pavilion.   He Song kept moving in the northwest direction of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion but occasionally looked back.   The Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was becoming smaller and smaller behind He Song.   It meant that He Song was getting farther and farther away from the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   After leaving the Immortal Pavilion and stepping onto a small hill full of dense forests several miles away, He Song used his Object Controlling Skills to quickly create a small cave on the hillside. He immediately entered the cave.   This was his first time leaving the Immortal Pavilion.   He Song didnt dare to go too far.   Being closer to the Immortal Pavilion, in case he encountered an Evil Cultivator, he might still have a chance to escape back to the Immortal Pavilion under the protection of the Thick Earth Amulet.   Once he returned to the Immortal Pavilion, the Law Enforcement Team inside would be able to save him.   If he went too far, he feared that he would be killed by the Evil Cultivator before he even had a chance to escape back to the Immortal Pavilion.   By then, everything would come to an end.   This time, he left the Immortal Pavilion just to avoid the Law Enforcement Team cultivators from the Immortal City, so he wouldnt die inexplicably in the hands of other cultivators greed.   He wasnt hiding from some great catastrophe that could affect thousands of miles, so naturally, he didnt need to run too far.   He only needed to leave the Immortal Pavilion, find a hidden corner not far from the Immortal Pavilion, and set up an Illusion Array to ensure his safety, then quietly wait for the cultivators of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team to leave.   Once they left, He Song could naturally return to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and continue his peaceful life.   In the mountain cave.   After using the Object Controlling Skills to excavate the cave where he now resided, He Song did not dare to pause and immediately took out the Nine Array Foundation from his storage bag.   This belonged to the foundation of the Illusion Array.   As his fingers formed a seal, streams of light continuously shot out from He Songs hand, quickly falling into their designated positions.   In an instant.   A flash of light flickered gently in the cave.   Illusion Array, successfully set up!   At this moment, He Song finally breathed a slight sigh of relief, forming another seal and using his array to cover a range of several tens of meters around him.   It wasnt until he had concealed everything, including his figure and breath, that He Song finally felt at ease.   Under the cover of the Illusion Array, he didnt need to worry about being discovered.   Even if someone was looking at this place from the outside at this moment, they wouldnt be able to detect any changes here. The mountain was still the same mountain.    The woods remained the same woods.   The cave He Song had opened up had disappeared. The mountainside looked just like it had before, unchanged from when there was no cave at all.   To be absolutely safe, He Song had activated the Illusion Array at full power, covering sight, hiding breath, and confusing the mind, all three functions were in full effect.bender   In this way, safety was naturally assured.   Leaving the cave.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎   Since the Illusion Array covered a range of several tens of meters around him, He Song could move around within this range without worrying about being discovered.   As a result, after leaving the cave, He Song quickly scanned his surroundings.   This was his first time leaving the Immortal Pavilion.   He didnt know if anyone was following him.   If there was someone following him, and he suddenly opened a cave and hid inside, that person would probably be getting ready to catch him off guard, right?   With that thought in mind, He Song activated the Spirit Vision Skill and constantly scanned the surroundings.   However.   No matter how He Song observed, he couldnt see any traces of other cultivators.   Only the occasional burst of birdsong around him made He Song aware that he was no longer in the Immortal Pavilion but outside it.   Half a moment later.   Upon realizing that there was actually no one following him, He Song finally calmed down and returned to the cave.   Under the cover of the Illusion Array, He Song could move within a range of several tens of meters without having to worry about being discovered.   Even if he expanded the original small cave into a several meters wide one, enough for a person to live in, no one would notice it.   After expanding the original small cave into a several meters wide one, enough for a person to live in.   He Song took out a cushion and placed it in the center of the cave.   He was about to set up the Spirit-Gathering Array.   But he suddenly felt that the Illusion Array had been touched by something.   In an instant, He Songs heart was alarmed, and he quickly conjured several Thick Earth Amulets in his hand.   Could it be that someone had arrived?   But he had clearly observed the outside for so long and hadnt seen any traces of anyone.   What   He Songs expression changed uncertainly.   But eventually, he decided to go outside to have a look.   After all, the area within several tens of meters around the cave had already been covered by the Illusion Array. As long as the Illusion Array was not broken, he wouldnt be discovered even if he left the cave..

Chapter 69: Chapter 69: The Complexities of Human Relations   Translator: 549690339   As soon as he thought about it, he did it.   He Song, holding several Thick Earth Amulets, left the cave with a solemn expression.   However, the moment he left the cave, his expression suddenly relaxed.   Not far away, a sound-transmitting paper crane stood at the periphery of the Illusion Array, seemingly unable to find its target.   Spirit power flowed through the paper crane, emitting a faint light, but it remained motionless, like a lifeless object.   He Song quickly reacted.   The Sound Transmission Skill, after exchanging breaths with a friend, only needed to release a paper crane or a bird to contact the other party. It was the preferred skill for Qi Refining stage cultivators to communicate over long distances.   Of course, if the other party was within a defensive array or had hidden their breath with the Breath Concealment Formulas, the Sound Transmission Skill would not be able to locate them and would stay where their breath disappeared.   Exchanging breaths with a friend was like adding a friend in a social network, which allowed them to contact each other using this trace of breath.   There was no need to worry about the trace of breath being tracked.   If there were a special skill to change ones breath, the Sound Transmission Skill would fail.   At the same time, once the Sound Transmission Skill was intercepted, the information on it would self-destruct instantaneously, and the person using it would know.   Indeed, when He Song arrived, he had come from the direction of the paper crane.   When he left the Immortal Pavilion, He Song did not use the Breath Concealment Formulas. This was not because he was careless, but rather, his excessive caution led him not to use the Breath Concealment Formulas when leaving the Immortal Pavilion.   Having spent more than ten years in the Immortal Pavilion, He Song knew it well.   In the Immortal Pavilion.   There were some hidden eyes watching those who left the Immortal Pavilion.   These people made a living by doing this, and they were ruthless.   Using the Breath Concealment Formulas and being considered weak by these people, they might be pursued and killed after leaving the Immortal Pavilion.   Revealing his Qi-refining mid-stage cultivation, these people dared not be too reckless.   However, if they encountered someone at the Qi Refining Early Stage leaving the Immortal Pavilion, they would probably show another face.   Exactly because of this.   He Songs breath was able to be tracked by the sound-transmitting paper crane all the way to this point, triggering He Songs Illusion Array.   The Illusion Array had the effect of hiding He Songs breath, so the paper crane could not enter and could only stay at the last position where He Songs breath disappeared.   If he had used the Breath Concealment Formulas when leaving the Immortal Pavilion, the sound-transmitting paper crane would have appeared beside He Songs house instead of here.    Seeing this.   He Song constantly observed his surroundings, and after being vigilant for a moment, he walked towards where the sound-transmitting paper crane was.   But during the walk, he held several Thick Earth Amulets in his hand, and could activate them to protect himself with just a thought.   When he reached the periphery of the Illusion Array, He Song reached out with one hand while being cautious of his surroundings, reaching for the paper crane.   His outstretched palm released a trace of his breath, and the paper crane in front of him suddenly turned into a thin sheet of paper and fell into He Songs   hand.   Seeing this, He Song quickly put the paper into his storage bag, withdrew his hand, and remained vigilant.   After a long time.   Seeing that there were no abnormalities around him, He Song finally breathed a sigh of relief and returned to the cave to look at the paper in his hand.   Thank you for the reminder. I am a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator and a high-ranking member of the Immortal Pavilion, so I dont need to worry about   that.    As for this matter, I have actually heard about it beforehand, but I didnt deliberately hide it from you, please forgive me.   I originally thought that I could protect you when the time came, so I didnt tell you. But I didnt expect that you already had a place to go.   However, if there are any changes along the way, feel free to contact me and I will come to the rescue immediately.   This matter is of great importance, please do not mention it to anyone else.   Wei Fan.   Glancing through the lines of words on the paper, He Song felt a warmth in his heart.   Wei Fan was a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator.bender   Moreover, he had successfully broken through from the seventh-tier Qi Refining to the eighth-tier of Qi Refining in the past two years. Such a cultivation base was not low in the Immortal Pavilion. Above him, there were only those ninth-tier Qi-refining cultivators who were advancing towards Foundation Establishment.   In addition to his identity as the Steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   He was undoubtedly a high-ranking member of the Immortal Pavilion.   He had obtained the news early on, but had not made a fuss about it, and had already planned to protect He Song at that time.   Unfortunately, He Song had accidentally learned this news from Zhao Lin today and had already left the Immortal Pavilion directly, opening up a cave outside the Pavilion to hide for a while before returning.   As a result, Wei Fans original plan to protect He Song fell through.   On the contrary, He Song had specifically informed him about the matter and asked him to prepare early.   Thinking about it, Wei Fan must be feeling very complicated right now.   He had originally planned to protect his friend in the crisis, but in the end, his friend had run away and even reminded him along the way.   This    The favor had not been given, and even owed more.   It was easy to imagine how Wei Fan was feeling at the moment.   Although the news He Song provided was something Wei Fan had known early on, the fact that He Song had notified him as soon as he learned it could also be considered a favor.   If the relationship between the two wasnt so good, who would have sent a message to remind them?Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎   Initially.   When He Song learned the news, he immediately considered whether or not to seek Wei Fans help.   But after considering it, He Song gave up on the tempting idea.   He left the Immortal Pavilion and hid in an Illusion Array not far away. He would not be in any danger.   Even if he was in danger, he could quickly escape back to the Immortal Pavilion.   With the guarantee of his safety, he could avoid the disaster.   If he sought Wei Fans help again, it would be more and more difficult to repay the favor.   Keep in mind.   Six years ago, during that great catastrophe, He Song had sought Wei Fans help.   Three years ago, during the Chen Zhou incident, He Song had also sought Wei Fans help.   If there really was another catastrophe this time, and he sought Wei Fans help again,   what about later? If there were more terrifying catastrophes in the future, who could He Song seek help from?   In the end, people have to rely on themselves.   If you rely on others, and they are not willing to help you, what should you do?   Even if Wei Fan was his good friend, willing to help him when his cultivation was still shallow in order to get his help later down the line as his cultivation improved,   He Song couldnt keep seeking him for every issue.   Favors were hard to repay.   Now that he had some initial self-protection capabilities, relying on oneself had become He Songs first choice.   Being able to rely on his own strength to avoid the disaster while ensuring his safety, why would he choose to owe favors?   However,   If he really encountered a problem he couldnt solve, He Song wouldnt stubbornly hold back either.   He still had to ask his friends for help when necessary.   Life was precious, and preserving his own life was what He Song needed to do most.   Putting the paper in his hand into the storage bag,   He Song gently waved his hand, and a thin sheet of paper appeared in his hand..

Chapter 70: Chapter 70: The Descent   Translator: 549690339   Since Brother Wei already knows, then Ive said too much. If the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team departs, please inform me at that time, so that I can return to the Immortal Pavilion as well.   He Song.   He Song channeled spirit power into his fingertips, and once the writing appeared on the paper, he spit out a wisp of spiritual power. The thin paper in his hand instantly transformed into a sound-transmitting paper crane, which soared into the sky, passing through the Illusion Array and disappearing in the blink of an eye.   The speed of the sound-transmitting paper crane was extremely fast, and Qi Refining stage cultivators could not possibly catch up to it.   Even Foundation Establishment masters would find it difficult to catch up without mastering a profound tunneling skill.   However, after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, the Sound Transmission Skill will be phased out, and sound transmission amulets will become the mainstream in the Cultivation World.   The Sound Transmission Skill is merely a convenient way for Qi Refining stage cultivators who cannot afford sound transmission amulets to communicate with friends quickly.   Between the Qi Refining stage cultivators, they each send out sound -transmitting paper cranes to each other.   There wont be any Foundation Establishment masters with nothing better to do intercepting or chasing them.   Cultivators are very busy and dont have that leisure time.   Moreover, if such a situation were to occur, the sound-transmitting paper crane would self-destruct instantly, and no information would be obtained.   This is also why He Song needed to release his aura when receiving the sound -transmitting paper crane.   Only He Songs aura could dissipate the spirit power in the paper crane, thus preventing it from self-destructing.   If they forcibly opened it, the sound-transmitting paper crane would instantly self-destruct.   He released the sound-transmitting paper crane.   After some contemplation, He Song ultimately decided not to leave this place.   Although his aura had spread from the Immortal Pavilion to this location, only the Sound Transmission Skill could follow his aura and locate him.   And it still couldnt enter the Illusion Array.   Ordinary cultivators wouldnt be able to find this place.   Auras were constantly dissipating every moment; in a few minutes, they would have mostly dissipated, and not every cultivator would be able to track them.   Only the Sound Transmission Skill, which inherently contained a trace of He Songs aura, could find where He Songs aura disappeared.   Under such circumstances, He Song didnt need to worry about any evildoers finding this place by following his aura.   This place was safe.    With that thought, He Song suddenly held five Array Foundations in his hands.   These belonged to the Spirit-Gathering Arrays Array Foundations.   However, being outside the Immortal Pavilion at the moment meant that the spirit Qi was thin. Even if he set up a Spirit-Gathering Array, the concentration of spirit Qi inside would likely be much less than when setting up a Spirit-Gathering Array inside the Immortal Pavilion.   Regardless, it should still exceed the concentration of spirit Qi within the Immortal Pavilion when not setting up a Spirit-Gathering Array. After all, the concentration of spirit Qi in the Immortal Pavilion wasnt just handed over for free.   The spirit Qi in the Immortal Pavilion was also gathered by the Spirit-Gathering Array.   Setting up a Spirit-Gathering Array outside the Immortal Pavilion, He Song believed that the spirit Qi gathered by the Spirit-Gathering Array should not be worse than that within the Immortal Pavilion.   With that thought, He Song formed hand seals.   Lines of flowing light suddenly flew out from He Songs hands, falling into their designated positions.   When a flash of light filled the cave, He Song immediately felt the originally thin spirit Qi inside the cave gradually becoming more dense.   Having already set up a Spirit-Gathering Array before, He Song naturally knew what was going on.   After the Spirit-Gathering Array was set up, it would take about ten days to reach maximum efficiency.   At that time, the concentration of spirit Qi within the array would reach its peak.   By then, it should be enough for him to cultivate.   Sitting on a cushion, He Song pondered these thoughts, but soon cast them aside and began practicing the Earth Tunneling Skill.   As a high-quality skill, the Earth Tunneling Skill was difficult to practice. He   Song guessed that being able to cultivate it to the point of normal use without damaging its power within a year would already be quite fortunate.   Keep in mind, He Songs soul was much stronger than ordinary cultivators, and his speed at learning skills was faster than theirs as well.   Even so, it would still take at least a year to cultivate it to the point of normal use without damaging its power.   Its easy to imagine how much longer it would take other cultivators to practice the Earth Tunneling Skill.bender   High-quality skills are already so difficult to cultivate.   What about Foundation Establishment skills?Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com   Would it take even longer?   It was not until now that He Song understood why cultivators in the Cultivation World complain about their short lifespans.   The truth is, the time spent on cultivation and other matters are simply too long.   Improvement in cultivation requires an accumulation of time.    The improvement of the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth requires a double accumulation of money and time.   Practicing skills also require a large amount of time.   In addition to handling trivial matters, seeking opportunities, earning spirit stones, and undertaking seclusive cultivation for breakthroughs,   Almost all cultivators, be they Qi Refining stage juniors or Foundation Establishment masters, find that time is far from enough.   It is precisely for this reason,   That cultivators become so desperate when trying to break through their cultivation and extend their life spans.   Fighting viciously for the slightest chance of breakthrough is no joke.   However, if they know that their life span is about to end or that they lack the power to break through, many cultivators will go to the mortal world and leave behind cultivation manuals and opportunities for future generations.   As a result, loose cultivators from the mortal world become cultivators every year, once again embarking on this difficult path.   In the Cultivation World, time is the greatest restraint for cultivators to approach one step closer to success.   Shaking his head, He Song cast aside his thoughts,   And quickly immersed himself in studying the Earth Tunneling Skill once more.   A few days later,   He Song, who was practicing the Earth Tunneling Skill outside the cave and within the scope of the Illusion Array, suddenly saw a group of people in the distance, walking directly towards the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion. As He Song was within the scope of the Illusion Array, those people wouldnt be able to detect him.   However, upon careful observation, He Song still recognized their identity based on the clothes they wore.   These are the standard mana robes of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team!   Green Wall Immortal City and Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion were connected. He Song recognized the clothes worn by the members of the Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team.   However, the clothes worn by the Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team were only standard uniforms, not mana robes.   The few people currently wearing standard mana robes in front of him were most likely members of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team that came from Green Wall Immortal City to deal with the current incident at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Since he was hidden within the Illusion Array, He Songs aura and figure were concealed, so he wasnt worried about being detected.   Therefore, when he noticed these individuals with distinct differences from the loose cultivators, he observed them carefully.   He could even see the style of their standard mana robes and the features of these peoples appearances clearly.   Given this, the identity of these people naturally became obvious.   I hope its just my imagination.   It was only after the figures vanished from his sight that He Song shook his head and sighed.   Although he had already left the Immortal Pavilion, even if it became more chaotic, it wouldnt affect him.   However, if the Immortal Pavilion really became chaotic after these people arrived, it would mean that He Songs previous speculations had been proven correct..

Chapter 71: Chapter 71: Half a Month Later   Translator: 549690339   In the Cultivation World,   strength is supreme.   The arrival of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team could mean they might be looking for some extra benefits.   If the Immortal Pavilion were to descend into chaos, some innocent cultivators could die at the hands of the law enforcement.   That would mean the darkness of the cultivation world would finally show its true face before He Song.   Ever since He Song arrived, what he experienced was relatively calm.   Although he had experienced two minor catastrophes,   the cruel reality of cultivators devouring each other in the Cultivation World had not appeared before him yet.   Cultivators strived against the world for their own lives.   Struggle!   Snatch!   Plunder!   Seize!bender   These were the main themes in the Cultivation World.   He Song had been in the Immortal Pavilion for more than a decade and had little contact with cultivators from the outside world.   Although he had been cautious, he was not fully aware of how dark the hearts of those cultivators could be.   Leaving the Immortal Pavilion this time, was mostly due to his cautious nature.   As for whether the law enforcement team from the Immortal City would act in such a way, He Song only had some suspicions in his heart.   However,   if news of innocent cultivators dying at the hands of the law enforcement team spread, He Song felt that his future would need to be even more cautious.   Peoples hearts are difficult to fathom. Only by being cautious, could one survive until the end. Anyway, only Wei Fan is still in the Immortal Pavilion. My other friends, like   Zhao Lin, have already escaped, Meng Guan is in the Immortal City, and Lin Cong went to Green Wall Immortal City six years ago. With Wei Fans strength and identity, it should be alright.   In the end, after pondering for a long time, He Song shook his head and continued practicing his Earth Tunneling Skill. The arrival of the law enforcement team, did not have much effect on He Song.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m   Outside the Immortal Pavilion, although the concentration of spirit Qi was low, it even had some advantages for He Song.   Inside the Illusion Array, there were no buildings or the like around, so He   Song could practice his Stone Breaking Finger technique without restraint.   When he was in the Immortal Pavilion, He Song had to be careful while practicing his Stone Breaking Finger technique, as there were buildings around.    One careless move could easily damage the building or even hurt pedestrians.   But outside the Immortal Pavilion, it was completely different.   There was no need to worry about damaging buildings or hurting people. As long as He Song stayed within the Illusion Array, he could attack wherever he wanted to.   Except for the core position of the Illusion Array, even if He Song demolished houses within the area covered by the array, no one would discover it.   Thus,   when He Song saw the law enforcement team members leave the Immortal Pavilion half a month later and received Wei Fans sound- transmitting paper crane, countless pits had already been scattered within the range of the Illusion Array.   All of these were caused by He Songs practice of the Stone Breaking Finger technique.   Inside the Illusion Array,   He Song opened the paper in his hand.   Immediately, row after row of text appeared before him.   Members of the Law Enforcement Team have left the Immortal City. Fellow cultivator, you can return to the Immortal Pavilion now.   However, if you can, please come to the Spirit Construction Pavilion once after you return to the Immortal Pavilion. There is something important to discuss.   Wei Fan.   There was not much information on the sound-transmitting paper crane. Wei Fan only asked He Song to come and find him shortly after returning to the Immortal Pavilion.   Putting away the paper, He Song thoughtfully looked in the direction of the Immortal Pavilion.   But immediately shook his head.   Half a month had passed,   He Song had been paying attention to the situation in the Immortal Pavilion all along.   However, due to the distance of several miles, the noise of the Immortal Pavilion couldnt reach He Songs location.   This made He Song completely unaware of what had happened in the Immortal Pavilion.   He only knew that many things must have happened in the Immortal Pavilion during the past half-month, but what exactly happened,   would have to wait until after returning to the Immortal Pavilion and asking Wei Fan to find out.   Apart from that,   He Song looked around and his expression showed some helplessness. Perhaps it was because it was his first time away from the Immortal Pavilion and he could practice his skills as he pleased, he accidentally caused numerous pits to form on the ground while practicing his Stone Breaking Finger technique.   This would not do.   Now that he was about to leave, he would need to restore this place.   Otherwise, once he withdrew the Illusion Array before leaving, the traces of the destroyed formations would be immediately exposed.   He Song did not want others to know that he had lived here for more than half a month.   Thankfully, there was a way to quickly erase all traces of his presence.   Using Object Controlling Skills,    He Song manipulated the spirit power inside his body, quickly filling the pits one by one.   Even after putting the foundations of the Illusion Array and Spirit-Gathering Array into his storage bag, he used Object Controlling Skills to close the cave.   After doing all this,   He Song finally activated his Light Body Skill and quickly rushed towards Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Soon,   He Songs figure entered the Immortal Pavilion.   However, as soon as he stepped into the Immortal Pavilion, He Song noticed something was wrong.   Inside the Immortal Pavilion, there were very few cultivators walking on the streets.   Even the few that were present, all seemed to be in a hurry, as if they were unwilling to stay on the streets.   Previously bustling streets were now sparsely populated, losing the vibrant atmosphere they once had.   Looking further away,   many of the rental houses in the outer area of the Immortal Pavilion showed signs of damage.   Some houses had no roofs; some had collapsed walls, with various furnishings exposed inside and no one trying to fix them.   He Song even saw traces of blood in some corners.   Glancing over the scene in the Immortal Pavilion, He Songs heart sank.   If he hadnt personally seen the law enforcement officers from the Immortal   City leave,   and received Wei Fans sound-transmitting paper crane proving they were no longer in the Immortal Pavilion, he might have turned around and left directly. The current state of the Immortal Pavilion, was entirely different from when he left.   When he left, the streets were lively, with countless cultivators coming and going due to the influx of loose cultivators in recent years.   Even the rental houses in the outskirts, after being refurbished by the Spirit Construction Pavilion six years ago, seemed brand new.   But now?   Looking at the changed scene in the Immortal Pavilion, He Song hesitated for a moment but ultimately decided to go to the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Since he had returned, he would go see Wei Fan first.   If the Immortal Pavilion was still not safe after meeting Wei Fan, he might have to leave again for some time.   Unimpeded,   He Song quickly arrived at the Spirit Construction Pavilion. On the second floor of the Spirit Construction Pavilion,   He bong went upstairs to see wel ran situng at a small came, wavmg at mm.   Wei, why has the Immortal Pavilion changed so much in the past half month? He Song asked with a frown as he sat down next to Wei Fan.   Not even half a month had passed, and the Immortal Pavilion had already changed.   Could it be that all these changes were brought about by the Law Enforcement Team from the Immortal City?   If so, wasnt their appetite too big?

Chapter 72: Chapter 72: Pharmacy Management   Translator: 549690339   Could it be that the upper echelons of the Immortal Pavilion are truly as I had originally thought, indifferent to these peoples actions?   Fellow Daoist, did you not already have a guess? Why are you asking me? Handing He Song a cup of tea, Wei Fan shook his head and laughed.   He had seen the changes in the Immortal Pavilion over the past half month.   But.   The only thing that has been affected is the periphery of the Immortal Pavilion; it has little to do with his practice as a Qi Refining late stage cultivator.   Moreover, He Song, who he has a close relationship with, had left the Immortal Pavilion before the personnel from the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team even arrived.   Naturally, he paid attention to the life and death of the cultivators in the periphery of the Immortal Pavilion, but he didnt care that much.   In the mortal world, humans only know that life is worthless.   But what they dont know is that in the Cultivation World, the life of a cultivator is also worthless.   Upon hearing Wei Fans counter question.   He Song shook his head, but he didnt continue to speak.   Guesses are guesses, facts are facts.   More than half a month ago, when he learned that the people of the Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team were coming, he already had a premonition of what would happen in the Immortal Pavilion.   Otherwise, he wouldnt have left the Immortal Pavilion directly, preferring to go to the places outside the Immortal Pavilion where the spirit Qi is thin instead of continuing to stay in the Immortal Pavilion.   But when the fact really appeared before his eyes.   Even though He Song had guesses, he still decided to ask Wei Fan and learn about the information of the past half month from him.   However.   Wei Fans counter-question made He Song suddenly come to his senses.   The incident has already happened.   No matter what exactly happened in the Immortal Pavilion in the past half month, it has certainly changed from before.   The corpses of the cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion are probably cleaned up by now.   After a while, the houses on the periphery of the Immortal Pavilion will be renovated, and the streets, which are sparsely populated now, will once again become as bustling as before.   With the passage of time, everything will disappear into nothingness.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com   Instead of asking again, it would be better to remind himself to be more cautious in the future.   In this way.            He can avoid the crisis and will not let himself die and be forgotten.   As an everlasting being.   He should always be more cautious than the regular cultivators.   After understanding this, He Song bowed to Wei Fan and thanked him.   Thank you, Brother Wei, for the clarification. However, you had mentioned something about a matter you wanted to discuss   Although he did not get the information about what happened in the Immortal Pavilion from Wei Fan in the past half month, He Song did not care too much about it at the moment.   There will be plenty of time in the future, and he can always learn more about it.   Now.   Lets see what Wei Fan wanted him for.   He Song didnt forget that on the sound-transmitting paper crane Wei Fan had said that he should find him after he returned to the Immortal Pavilion. There was a matter they needed to discuss.   So, what exactly is this affair?   Fellow Daoist, are you interested in taking the position of the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion? In response to He Songs question, Wei Fan didnt directly state the matter. Instead, he asked He Song a question.   The manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion? Upon hearing this, He Song raised an eyebrow, but then he quickly reacted.   What was Wei Fan doing asking him this question at this time?   Could it be   If Fellow Daoist wishes, I can apply to the upper leader on your behalf. Given your cultivation at the fifth level of Qi Refining and your status as a spiritual plant farmer, there is a significant chance.   Halfway through his speech, seeing that He Song seemed to have understood his meaning, Wei Fan added another sentence.   Three days ago, a steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and two managers were killed inside the Pavilion. Their positions are naturally now vacant.    After hearing Wei Fans explanation, He Song instantly understood everything.   No wonder.   No wonder as soon as Wei Fan saw the personnel from the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team leaving, he hurriedly sent out a sound-transmitting paper crane.   Turns out it was because a steward and two managers of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion were killed and their positions were left vacant.   Having been in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion for over a decade, He Song naturally understood the rules of the Immortal Pavilion.   The Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, Spirit Skill Pavilion, Spirit Construction Pavilion   The duties in these places that maintain the normal operation of the Spiritual Pavilion are naturally stipulated.   The spiritual plant farmers of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, the receptionists of the Spirit Skill Pavilion, the receptionists of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, as long as one is a cultivator, they can do these jobs. These are the lowest level personnel of the Immortal Pavilion.   The managers of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, the Spirit Skill Pavilion, the Spirit Construction Pavilion, these positions require a certain standing within the Immortal Pavilion and are the middle level of the Immortal Pavilion.            Finally, the stewards of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, the Spirit Skill Pavilion, the Spirit Construction Pavilion, these positions require a cultivation level of Qi Refining late stage. These are the high level of the Immortal   Dnvilinn   Of course, the highest ranks of the Immortal Pavilion can always only be Masters of Foundation Establishment.   The stewards, managers, and bottom-level personnel below them can never become the highest level as long as they havent reached the Foundation Establishment stage.   For instance, Wei Fan. He is a cultivator in the Qi-refining late stage and also a steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, so he is a part of the high level of the Immortal Pavilion.   As for Meng Guan in the past, Meng Guan was a Qi-refining mid-stage cultivator and was also a manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, so he belonged to the middle level of the Immortal Pavilion.   And now, He Song. Although he is a Qi-refining mid-stage cultivator, he is only a spiritual plant farmer and is still at the lowest level of the Immortal Pavilion.   Besides this.   There are also some special cases.   Like Pinger of the Spirit Skill Pavilion, she became a manager of the Spirit Skill Pavilion during the Qi-refining mid-stage.   He Song didnt know the reason, but he thought there must be a reason.   There was a hierarchy among the managers of different pavilions. Although He Songs cultivation was at the Qi-refining mid-stage, since he was usually busy practicing and learning skills, he was almost invisible in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   So it makes sense that he has always been a spiritual plant farmer.   However, if He Songs cultivation breaks through from being at the Qi-refining mid-stage to the late stage.   As long as he doesnt leave the Immortal Pavilion, he can be promoted to the position of steward instantly. No matter which pavilion it is, he can successfully join and become the new steward, thus joining the upper level of the Immortal Pavilion.   The cultivation of the Qi-refining late stage is already considered high within this small Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Thats also why Wei Fan can live so comfortably here.   The Immortal Pavilion is too small, and to keep a cultivator from leaving at the Qi-refining late stage, supporting their status and position is necessary.   Otherwise, if they all went to the Immortal City, who would manage the Immortal Pavilion?   Brother Wei, do you know why these people were killed? Upon learning that he suddenly has the opportunity to be promoted to the manager of the   Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, He Song didnt pay too much attention to it.   The job of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion manager isnt much different from that of a spiritual plant farmer. Otherwise, He Song would have already vied for it instead of waiting until now.   What he cared more about was the reason why a steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and two managers were suddenly killed.   The steward is at least a Qi-refining late stage cultivator, a high-ranking member of the Immortal Pavilion.   And still, he was killed and moreover, killed within the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.bender   This He Song doesnt even need to think to know this must have been the doing of the people from the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team.   If not, a steward and two managers so easily getting killed would stir up a huge commotion within the Immortal Pavilion.   But now, what about now?            

Chapter 73: Chapter 73: Colluding with Evil Cultivators   Translator: 549690339   Not only was there no significant turbulence.   Even Wei Fan, who is also a senior cultivator of the Immortal Pavilion, has already begun paving the way for his friends.   As one can imagine, the steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and the two managers who committed the offenses must have done something enormous.   It might have even caused public outrage.   Otherwise, such a scene would not be possible.   As a senior in the Immortal Pavilion, it’s impossible to watch one’s colleagues be killed.   “That person colluded with the Evil Cultivator and instructed his followers to recruit the Evil Cultivator into the Immortal Pavilion. With conclusive evidence, he was caught and killed by the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, along with his two accomplices. The hidden Evil Cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion were also wiped out.”   Wei Fan’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he spoke.   As a cultivator of Qi-refining late stage, he is also a high-ranking member of the Immortal Pavilion.   Seeing his colleagues colluding with the Evil Cultivator, he is naturally filled with rage.   Coming out of the Thick Earth Mansion, his heart always leans towards the Thick Earth Sect, and naturally, he would want to destroy the Evil Cultivator as soon as possible.   And this is exactly the reason why the killing of the steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion by the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team did not cause a major disturbance.   In Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   In Green Wall Immortal City.   Under the rule of the Thick Earth Sect.   The only result of colluding with the Evil Cultivator is death!   “Colluding with the Evil Cultivator and recruiting them into the Immortal Pavilion?” Repeating Wei Fan’s words, He Song’s eyebrows raised instantly. He thought of Chen Zhou.   Chen Zhou was also recruited into the Immortal Pavilion six years ago. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎  Could it be…   He Song had a bold guess in his heart.   However, He Song quickly overturned this conjecture.   If Chen Zhou were really an evil cultivator, asking Wei Fan to kill Chen Zhou would have caused a reaction from the Evil Cultivator’s side.   However, until today, three years later, evil cultivators have been wiped out by the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, and the Evil Cultivators have not taken any retaliatory actions.   In this case, it can be concluded.   Chen Zhou probably has little to do with the hidden evil cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion.    Of course, it’s also possible that the evil cultivators discovered Wei Fan as the mastermind and didn’t know that He Song was the one pulling the strings behind the scenes.   Facing a cultivator at the late stage of Qi- refining, the evil cultivators ultimately did not dare to take revenge.   At the same time.   He Song also thought of Zhao Lin.   If He Song remembers correctly, Zhao Lin took over Meng Guan’s position and became the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion with his cultivation at the fourth-tier of Qi Refining.   And Chen Zhou was recruited into the Immortal Pavilion by Zhao Lin.   If Chen Zhou had a problem, Zhao Lin probably could not escape responsibility.   But Wei Fan had already said that the hidden evil cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion had been wiped out, so naturally, there would be no fish slipping through the net.   As long as Zhao Lin is alive, he should have no problems.   “Brother Wei, is there a list of the deceased from the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion? I have a good friend who happens to be the manager of the Spiritual   Medicine Pavilion.”   Although he knows that Zhao Lin has already left the Immortal Pavilion like himself to avoid danger, He Song still asks.   Better safe than sorry.   What if Zhao Lin was caught and brought back?   At the same time, He Song was also very grateful in his heart.   Grateful for his caution.   If he hadn’t left the Immortal Pavilion, he might have been interrogated continuously by the people of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team after their arrival.   Although he is not an evil cultivator, who knows if the people from the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team would label him as such if they don’t like him?   By then, he would probably be in trouble even if he didn’t die.   After all, who would let the steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion collude with the evil cultivators? Everyone in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion would probably be thoroughly investigated.   If there’s no issue, it would be considered a pass.   And if there is a problem, they would have been killed three days ago.   Whether there’s a problem or not is beyond one’s control.   He Song doesn’t want to entrust his life and property to others, which is why he left the Immortal Pavilion.   “You must be talking about Zhao Lin from three years ago. Before Lao Meng left, he had mentioned him to me. Half a month ago, he was also under suspicion.”   “But in the end, after a thorough investigation, he was cleared of suspicion. As an amulet Tao master, he has a promising future, does not bear grudges with others in his daily life, has a cautious nature, and has nothing to do with the evil cultivators.”   Wei Fan continued to speak as he recalled thoughtfully.   “However, like you, he suddenly claimed he wanted to travel before the arrival of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team and then lost contact. No one knows where he is now.”    In the end, Wei Fan shook his head, but it seemed like he suddenly remembered something, and his gaze turned to He Song.   “Did you get the information from him?”   Wei Fan’s gaze on He Song was a bit strange.   He suddenly remembered six years ago.   Six years ago.   Before Master Cheng Shan left the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, He Song had already sensed something and felt that the Immortal Pavilion was bound for chaos.   He, as He Song’s friend, also believed He Song’s words at that time.   Not only did he spend a huge sum of money to buy Artifacts, spirit amulets, and other life-saving items, but he was also constantly on guard against the Evil Cultivator’s attack.   The fact proved that what He Song said was true.   Before the arrival of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, He Song had already left the Immortal Pavilion to avoid being implicated in advance.   If He Song got the information from Zhao Lin…   He seemed to understand something as well.   No wonder.   No wonder the two men disappeared from the Immortal Pavilion at the same time.   It seemed that He Song must have sensed something and told Zhao Lin about it.   Then, the two left the Immortal Pavilion separately, planning to hide for a while before coming back.   As his mind flashed with speculations about the incident, a strange look appeared in Wei Fan’s eyes as he looked at He Song.   Why did this scene feel so familiar?   It seemed that he had experienced it too.   It’s just that last time he went through it with He Song, and this time, He Song left the Immortal Pavilion with Zhao Lin.   “Yes, that day he personally brought gifts to my door, and then…” Picking out what he could say, He Song recounted the story of Zhao Lin coming to his house to give him a gift.   Very candidly.   After all, He Song did send a message to Wei Fan before leaving the Immortal Pavilion during the crisis, which was a true test of their friendship, and Wei Fan could not say a word of disagreement.   However, after listening to He Song’s description, the look Wei Fan gave He Song became even stranger. Caution.   He was really too cautious!   With just a little rustling, He Song seemed to know in advance and quickly dodged the situation.   Such cautiousness made him admire He Song.   However, it was precisely because of He Song’s caution that he was more optimistic about He Song’s prospects.   “Alright, alright, let’s stop talking about him. There are now two vacant spots for the position of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion’s manager. If you are interested, I will apply for you.”   “If Zhao Lin comes back, you can also ask him for help since he is also the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion. I’m sure he should have some influence in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and can increase your chances.”   Knowing that He Song was asking about Zhao Lin, and since Zhao Lin is not an accomplice of the evil cultivators, Wei Fan naturally didn’t care too much. Instead, he started discussing benefits for He Song..

Chapter 74: Chapter 74: Inauspicious   Translator: 549690339   Spiritual Medicine Pavilion Manager.   Although it was not a high position, it was much more relaxed than being a spiritual plant farmer and provided a higher income as well.   Wei Fan naturally hoped to get He Song out of the spiritual plant farmer pit.   However, he didn’t know.   For He Song, the position of Spiritual Medicine Pavilion Manager was not very attractive. Although he could become a middle-level manager in Immortal Pavilion, to He Song, whether he manages or not, both were trivial matters.   What’s important was that no one would disturb him when he cultivated in his spare time.   That was the most critical factor.   It’s true that after becoming the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion Manager, he would earn more spirit stones, but the increase would not be significant.   Zhao Lin was one of the managers of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, and He Song was clear about his income, which was about a hundred and several spirit stones a year. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com  Compared to the ninety spirit stones a spiritual plant farmer earns in a year, it’s only an increase of a dozen or so.   For the sake of earning these dozen more spirit stones a year,   he would have to work like a servant in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion every day… He Song was not willing.   It would be better to continue being a small spiritual plant farmer, taking half an hour each day to use the Spirit Rain Skill, and using the rest of the time for cultivation or other activities.   Wasn’t this better than working like a servant?   “Maybe I should forget about it. Being a spiritual plant farmer is pretty good. I have plenty of time for cultivation every day. If I become a manager, I’m afraid I’ll have to be on duty every day and my cultivation speed will slow down a lot.”   He naturally wanted to accept Wei Fan’s kindness, but after some consideration, He Song chose to refuse it.   There was no other reason.   Continuing to be a spiritual plant farmer, he could cultivate every day in the Spirit-Gathering Array at home, which would naturally help him to progress more quickly in his cultivation. If he really took a position as a Spiritual Medicine Pavilion manager, his cultivation speed would certainly slow down without the support of the Spirit-Gathering Array.   For the sake of the dozen or so spirit stones, 1–1e Song was unwilling to see his cultivation speed slow down while also having to be on duty at the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   “Don’t worry, I’ve considered everything you’re concerned about. One of the two deceased managers had a very relaxed position that won’t interfere with your cultivation. I’ve considered all these factors.”   Seeing that He Song was somewhat reluctant, Wei Fan immediately began to explain to him.   “The management position I’m fighting for you is to guard the medicine garden in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion. You only need to be present in the Medicine Garden during the day, and you don’t need to deal with other matters; the people below will take care of them.”   “You just need to watch over the Medicine Garden during the day and check the garden once at the end of the day. In addition, the concentration of spirit Qi in the Medicine Garden is much higher than elsewhere, which would make your cultivation speed faster when you cultivate there.”    With Wei Fan’s explanation, He Song quickly got a better understanding of the Medicine Garden Manager position. Being a Medicine Garden Manager, was essentially being a supervisor.   For example, the responsibilities like using the Spirit Rain Skill, turning over the soil, watering the plants, and fertilizing would be done by others.   If He Song became the Medicine Garden Manager, he would only need to check the number of spirit medicines at the beginning and end of the day-   Apart from that, the rest of his time could be spent freely.   Moreover, due to the high concentration of spirit Qi in the Medicine Garden, as most spirit medicines need more abundant spirit Qi, the cultivation speed would be much faster.   Even compared to the Spirit-Gathering Array at He Song’s home, the difference is likely negligible.   Also, with the natural spirit Qi emanating from the spirit medicine, the cultivation speed within the Medicine Garden would be even faster.   So it could be said, that the position of Medicine Garden Manager was quite appealing.   Even though there was a Spirit-Gathering Array at He Song’s house, cultivating in the Medicine Garden would not be slower, but even faster.   In this way, he could earn more spirit stones while increasing his cultivation speed, why wouldn’t he agree?   At this thought, He Song cupped his hands towards Wei Fan and thanked him,   “Thank you, Wei, I will keep your kindness in mind.”   He Song agreed, and seeing that He Song accepted the offer, Wei Fan was satisfied and nodded.   As close friends for over ten years, they have helped each other on many occasions. Wei Fan naturally hoped to see He Song’s cultivation improve quickly.   Only when He Song’s cultivation improved could he truly help Wei Fan.   Sometimes, this behavior is called creating factions, but most of the time, it’s called mentoring juniors.   When the juniors grow up, the benefits they bring will naturally not be too little.   Moreover, he didn’t lose anything.   It was just a simple application.   Since anyone could be the Medicine Garden Manager, why not his close friend He Song?   With their discussion finished.   In the following time,   the two chatted leisurely for a while at the Spirit Construction Pavilion before He Song bid his farewell and left.   Upon leaving the Spirit Construction Pavilion,   He Song thought for a moment and then walked toward where his home was located.    He hadn’t returned for over half a month, so it was time to clean his room.   However, with the Object Controlling Skills he had cultivated, cleaning the room could also be done with that skill.   As He Song was thinking about these things, he walked quickly,   However,   Just as He Song was walking towards his home, he suddenly noticed a familiar figure standing outside his door.   Zhao Lin,   He was pacing back and forth outside He Song’s room.   Looking at him, it seemed as if he was hesitating whether to knock on the door or not.   Seeing this, He Song felt a little puzzled but quickly walked up to him and invited him in,   “Brother Zhao, why don’t you come in and have a chat?”   The sudden sound made Zhao Lin tremble, and he quickly produced a few Thick Earth Amulets. However, upon seeing that it was He Song who had spoken, Zhao Lin finally relaxed.   Ignoring how He Song appeared beside him, Zhao Lin put away the Thick Earth Amulets and then cupped his hands. “I shall follow your suggestion, let’s go inside and chat.”   Both of them entered the house together,   He Song used the Object Controlling Skills to clean up the dusty room and then invited Zhao Lin to sit at the table.   By the side of the desk,   He Song skillfully brewed tea.   When guests arrived, the common people cooked and the cultivators brewed tea, as this was the way to treat guests.   Although He Song didn’t know what Zhao Lin was looking for, he still needed to provide hospitality.   While He Song brewed the tea,   Zhao Lin simply looked out the window, lost in thought.   It was only when the fragrance of tea filled the room and He Song placed a freshly brewed cup in front of Zhao Lin that he finally withdrew his gaze from the window and picked up the teacup.   Immediately after that, Zhao Lin sighed deeply,   “Fellow Daoist, do you know why I lingered outside your house for so long but never dared to knock on your door?”   Looking at He Song beside him, no emotions could be seen on Zhao Lin’s face.   However, before He Song could respond,   Zhao Lin’s voice sounded again,   “Fellow Daoist, more than half a month ago, I promised to findsomeone to take care of your seven-acre spirit field. Do you remember?”   As he spoke, Zhao Lin put down the teacup in his hand, stood up, and bowed to He Song.   Seeing this, He Song suddenly had a bad feeling..

Chapter 75: Shelf Testimonial   Translator: 549690339   Thank you, editor Qinghu.   Thanks to the book friends who have been following all the way.   Apologize to the readers who didn’t catch up to the latest chapters.   Sorry for writing a story you didn’t like.   This book has a slow pace and lacks any pretentious, face-slapping plotlines or over-the-top, extraordinary Golden Fingers.   From the author’s perspective, this is indeed somewhat disappointing. As a result, this book only went through two rounds of recommendations and will be featured on the premium shelves tomorrow.    It’s quite a setback.   But, since the birth of this book, the author had only one word in mind for everything he wrote.   Perseverance.   Persevering to the end.   Under the condition of endless lifespan, steadily cultivating immortality.   Step by step, walking the path to immortality.   This idea came about after the author feaa many long-lite Da01St texts last year, only to find that many were off-topic.   However, after reading countless novels where the protagonist constantly causes trouble and kills higher-level enemies one after another just for the sake of an exciting title, the author also had doubts.    Is there no one interested in reading Persevering-Daoist long-life novels?   Or is it just that nobody likes the real Persevering-Daoist long-life texts?   Then why don’t they just write a Persevering-Daoist long-life novel instead of pretending to write one and selling a completely different product?   The author didn’t believe it.   So, I decided to take up the pen.   That’s how this book came to be. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com  Unfortunately, perhaps due to the author’s own reasons, this book’s performance is not very good.   In the upcoming updates, the author will try to pick up the pace, in hope that the plot will progress faster. I hope to change some of the reviews.   Lastly,   For the readers who like this book, the author shamelessly asks for your subscriptions. Without your support, this book wouldn’t have made it this far.   Thank you from the author!

Chapter 76: Chapter 75: Encountering an Attack (1/5)   Translator: 549690339   Could it be…   He Song forcefully suppressed the urge to ask about the reason.   He just stared at Zhao Lin without blinking, wanting to hear what he would say next.   Up ahead.   Zhao Lin bowed to He Song with a solemn expression.   “I’ve broken my promise. The person I entrusted with the task was killed several days ago, and your spirit field has been left untended for several days.”   For the past half month since he left the Immortal Pavilion…   Everything had been going smoothly.   The person Zhao Lin found, for the sake of thirty spirit stones in remuneration, naturally tended to He Song’s spirit field diligently.   However, things took an unexpected turn several days ago.   The person was suddenly killed.   When Zhao Lin returned today, he learned of everything and discovered that He Song’s spirit field had been left untended for several days.   In light of this terrible news, Zhao Lin felt he had let down He Song’s trust, which was why he came to He Song’s residence hoping to make amends.   But unexpectedly, while hesitating outside He Song’s house, he was seen by He Song, who had just returned home.   And so, the current situation unfolded.   However…   As Zhao Lin bowed and apologized to He Song, the latter let out a sigh of relief after hearing his words.   With no one tending the spirit field and inadequate spirit Qi supply, the yield would naturally decrease somewhat.   If this had persisted for ten days or half a month with insufficient spirit Qi supply, the decreased yield would then become irredeemable.   Luckily, he had only been gone for several days, so the situation was still manageable.   He had thought something more serious had happened.   So that’s it?   “It’s not a big deal. It’s only been a few days. I’ll just use the Spirit Rain Skill for an extra hour later, and the spirit Qi will naturally be replenished. There won’t be any losses, so you’re taking this matter too seriously,” said He Song, waving his hand to show that he didn’t mind.   Since there was no loss, the death of the person who was previously responsible wasn’t related to He Song.    Naturally, He Song didn’t care too much about it.   In his view, Zhao Lin’s reaction was a bit excessive.   “Ah, I must have entrusted the wrong person. If any consequences truly arise, you’re welcome to come find me, and I will make up for the losses, ” Zhao Lin hurriedly promised.   This was his fault, so he would naturally bear any losses caused by it.   Though Zhao Lin was usually cautious, he was sensible enough to not let He Song bear the responsibility for this.   Keep in mind that He Song had already paid for this.   Although the person was dead and the agreed-upon thirty spirit stones were no longer needed as a reward, Zhao Lin still bore the responsibility for the incident.   To the side.   Seeing Zhao Lin like this, He Song could only helplessly wave his hand.   However, He Song soon remembered the matter Wei Fan had mentioned to him.   “If you can’t get over it, my friend is helping me apply for the position of Medicine Garden Manager. If you could put in a good word for me, we can consider the matter settled,” He Song proposed.   When he was with Wei Fan, the latter had mentioned this idea.   Although Wei Fan was a steward and a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator, he belonged to the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Helping He Song apply for a position in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion was not impossible, but if Zhao Lin, who was also a manager in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, submitted an application for He Song, his chances of becoming the manager would be even greater.   Now, taking advantage of this opportunity to settle this matter would be a good thing.   “Alright, consider it done,” agreed Zhao Lin upon hearing He Song’s words.   He Song had made it clear in his words that his friend was helping him apply for the position of Medicine Garden Manager.   It didn’t matter who the friend was; what mattered was that someone was leading the effort, and all he had to do was submit the application.   At that time, regardless of whether He Song became the manager or not, Zhao Lin would still consider the matter settled.   With that in mind, Zhao Lin had no reason to refuse.   Having come to an agreement, the atmosphere between the two naturally became more amicable.   In He Song’s residence.   The two exchanged cups of tea that were as fragrant and delightful as wine. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com  Time flew by.   After the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team descended upon Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and left, He Song resumed his peaceful life.   At the same time, he quickly learned from other people in the Immortal Pavilion what the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team had been up to during the half-month they spent there.   Initially.    When the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team arrived at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, most of the cultivators had no idea what was about to happen.   Just like Zhao Lin, who hadn’t planned on running away originally.   They even believed that the arrival of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team would improve the atmosphere in the Immortal Pavilion.   However, after the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team successfully took control of the Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team, ordered them to conduct a self-inspection, and smoothly purged several Evil Cultivators from their ranks…   The developments took everyone at the Immortal Pavilion by surprise.   Once the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team completely took control of the Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team…   and thoroughly eradicated the malignant tumors within the ranks, they began to target the other cultivators.   Under the leadership of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team…   The Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team scattered to apprehend people characterized as notorious individuals, with any resistance met with instant execution.   In addition, some Immortal Pavilion cultivators and loose cultivators inexplicably disappeared.   This included wealthy cultivators and loose cultivators who had amassed fortunes through the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   Their residences were either left in ruin or remained untouched.   But they all shared one commonality.   Members of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team had visited their residences.   Initially, all of this happened discreetly.   Until that day.   When the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team and the Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team launched a joint operation, they executed a steward and two managers of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion on the spot, and conducted an inquisition of all the people there.   Those found to have issues were executed on the spot, while the others were allowed to leave freely.   The missing individuals were also pushed out one by one, and subsequently executed.   On that day, executions outside of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion caused heads to roll and blood to flow like a river.   At the same time, a piece of news also spread.   A steward and two managers of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion had colluded with Evil Cultivators, deliberately allowing them to join the Immortal Pavilion. The Immortal City Law Enforcement Team was ordered to eliminate the Evil Cultivators in one fell swoop.   The Immortal City Law Enforcement Team was about to leave.   They wanted to use this as a deterrent.   The spread of this news, coupled with the massacre in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, etched this day into the minds of everyone at the Immortal Pavilion.   However, just as He Song learned of this news…   Another explosive piece of news shook the entire Green Wall Immortal City.   The Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, which had just left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion…   was attacked on their way back to Green Wall Immortal City.   Two Qi-refining mid-stage cultivators were killed on the spot, one Qi-refining late-stage cultivator was besieged and killed, and the remaining two Qi-refining late-stage cultivators only managed to escape with their lives using their life-saving aces..

Chapter 77: Chapter 76: One Year (2/5)   Translator: 549690339   But they paid the price of both suffering heavy injuries.   When the news reached He Song, he paused for a moment.   Then his expression darkened.   “Are Evil Cultivators so bold now? They actually dare to attack the members of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team within the Green Wall Immortal   City’s area?”   As these thoughts flashed through his mind, He Song quickly understood.   Six years ago.   When Master Cheng Shan was not around.   Evil Cultivators had even besieged the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   If Wei Fan hadn’t intervened that time, He Song might still be struggling in the mortal world right now.   Evil Cultivators are called such for a reason.   As long as there are enough benefits, they can do things that leave people astonished.   Of course, ordinary cultivators could also turn into Evil Cultivators and perform acts of murder and robbery at certain times.   As long as no one finds out.   No one would chase after them.   This time, the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team completely wiped out the Evil Cultivators in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion. The Evil Cultivators couldn’t retaliate within the Immortal Pavilion, as Foundation Establishment Masters were present. Those Qi-refining stage Evil Cultivators would die as soon as they tried.   But just because they couldn’t act within Immortal Pavilion didn’t mean they couldn’t act outside of it.   The Law Enforcement Team members had to leave Immortal Pavilion eventually, right?   Once they left the Immortal Pavilion, they wouldn’t have the master’s protection anymore.   By then…   He Song only needed to think for a moment to understand the cause.   At the same time, he sighed inwardly.   It seemed that the Cultivation World could not escape hatred and revenge either.   The attack on the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team by the Evil Cultivators didn’t impact He Song much.   So after hearing about it, he merely lamented a bit and then put it out of his mind.   He was in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   And within the Immortal Pavilion, Master Cheng Shan was present.   As long as He Song was in the Immortal Pavilion, even if the Evil Cultivators outside raised hell, they couldn’t affect him.   However, He Song continued to hear news about Green Wall Immortal City’s efforts to suppress Evil Cultivators and the Evil Cultivators’ sneak attacks on the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team from time to time.    The Law Enforcement Team, having lost one late stage and two mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators to the Evil Cultivators’ attack, naturally couldn’t let the matter rest.   So, the Green Wall Immortal City Law Enforcement Team began a crackdown on the local Evil Cultivators.   Today, there would be news of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team killing several Evil Cultivators in a certain place.   Tomorrow, there would be news of Evil Cultivators launching sneak attacks on the Law Enforcement Team, resulting in several deaths and injuries.   As both sides fought back and forth, neither showed any signs of stopping, with news constantly coming in. Time went by day by day.   He Song’s life was relatively peaceful.   It was worth mentioning that.   A few months after returning to the Immortal Pavilion, He Song successfully became the head of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   With the help of Wei Fan and Zhao Lin, He Song also managed to secure the position of Medicine Garden administrator.   Since then.   He Song spent his days guarding the Medicine Garden and cultivating.   At night, he would return to his home, cultivating or comprehending skills in the Spirit-Gathering Array.   One year quickly passed.   On this day.   He Song’s Earth Tunneling Skill had been practiced to the point where he could use it at will without losing its power.   However, despite studying for more than a year, He Song was still unable to complete the Five Phases Array.   According to He Song’s estimation, it would take almost two more years to fully set up the Five Phases Array.   But.   Even so. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com  Only when He Song had practiced his Earth Tunneling Skill to the point where he could use it at will without any loss of power, did he shift his focus from the inside of the Immortal Pavilion to the outside.   With the Earth Tunneling Skill.   When he entered and exited the Immortal Pavilion, he would no longer be discovered by others.   Even if he encountered an Evil Cultivator after leaving the Immortal Pavilion, he wouldn’t have to worry about being discovered by them.   After all, He Song not only used the Earth Tunneling Skill but also the Breath Concealment Formulas.   He was underground, without any traces of his breath.   Such concealment would make it extremely difficult for Qi-refining cultivators to detect He Song’s movements.   In this way.   He Song’s courage naturally grew.   Even if there were confrontations between the Evil Cultivators and the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team outside, He Song wouldn’t have to worry about being discovered by others.   In that case, given that he will also have the Five Phases Array completed within two years.   At this moment.    Finding one or even several fields, then setting up a Spirit-Gathering Array, and turning them into spirit fields for backup, became He Song’s goal at this moment.   Spirit fields are not ordinary fields.   Ordinary fields cannot grow spirit rice.   Spirit fields require a non-stop supply of spirit Qi day and night to nourish them, so they can transform a common field into a spirit field within a few years.   According to He Song’s estimation.   If he set up a Spirit-Gathering Array and used it to confine the spirit Qi within a certain range, a common field could be transformed into a spirit field within two years.   By then, as long as he could successfully set up the Five Phases Array, he would be able to harvest spirit stones continuously from the spirit field. However, he didn’t know how large this range should be.   If it were larger, he would need fewer arrays to set up.   If it were smaller, in order to ensure a continuous supply of spirit stones for the future, He Song would have to set up more arrays.   Standing up from the meditation mat.   He Song’s gaze swept across the quiet room, and his hands quickly deactivated the Spirit-Gathering Array and the Illusion Array within the room.   He collected all the Array Foundations into his storage bag.   Thinking about it, a piece of thin paper appeared in He Song’s hand.   Spirit power surged from his fingertip, and rows of characters quickly appeared on the paper.   “Wei, I need to undergo seclusive cultivation for a few days. I need your help to check the management of the Medicine Garden daily.”   “He Song.”   As He Song spat out spirit power, the paper immediately transformed into a sound -transmitting paper crane and flew skyward, heading towards the distance.   The management of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion’s Medicine Garden was a significant responsibility. He Song wouldn’t feel at ease leaving it to others, so he needed Wei Fan to do it so he could feel more at ease.   Therefore, when he needed to select the location of the spirit field later, it was better to hand over the management duties to Wei Fan.   After all, He Song had once taken over Wei Fan’s work at the Spirit Construction Pavilion last time.   In this way, it wouldn’t seem unfamiliar.   After finishing all this, He Song didn’t immediately use Earth Tunneling to leave. Instead, he walked out of the room and headed towards the Stall Section.   Stall Section.   It was still bustling, just like when He Song first arrived.   However, when He Song visited this time, he found many more unfamiliar faces in his line of sight.   Some familiar faces he knew had disappeared, replaced by completely unfamiliar new faces.   Seeing this scene, He Song sighed in his heart.   But soon, he cast aside the feeling of loss.   He purchased two bottles of Inedia Elixir at the Stall Section.   One bottle contained ten Inedia Elixirs, worth two spirit stones.   He spent four spirit stones on two bottles of Inedia Elixir.   One Inedia Elixir could suppress hunger for ten days, so He Song chose to buy two bottles just before leaving in case of emergency.   With two bottles of Inedia Elixir on him, he wouldn’t need to bring spirit rice out again.   Though spirit rice tasted good and could enhance one’s cultivation, it took up a lot of space, which He Song disliked while traveling..

Chapter 78: Chapter 77: Li Dynasty (3/5)   Translator: 549690339   Besides the Inedia Elixir, after some thought, He Song decided to sell all the low-level spirit amulets he had on him. He then used the spirit stones he earned from selling these spirit amulets to purchase two mid-level Thick Earth Amulets.   The spirit amulets that were originally left on He Song.   And the spirit amulets scraped from Chen Zhou’s storage bag.   All added together, there were as many as eight.   Each one sold for five spirit stones, so eight would make forty spirit stones, which was exactly enough to purchase two mid-level Thick Earth Amulets.   A mid-level Thick Earth Amulet, with its tremendous defensive power, would provide a life-saving protection if any accident occurs.   However.   Two mid-level Thick Earth Amulets were obviously not enough.   Therefore, He Song dug into his wallet again, spending another forty spirit stones to buy another two Thick Earth Amulets.   A total of four mid-level Thick Earth Amulets in his possession.   He Song still felt that it was not enough, but alas, he was left with only over sixty spirit stones on him. The remaining sixty or so spirit stones would have to be used to create the Array Foundation.   It could be said that if it wasn’t for the past year, He Song would not have been able to create the Array Foundation even with his annual salary of over a hundred spirit stones. Right now, with his wallet thin.   He just had to make do with it.   Scanning the Stall Section with his gaze, He Song sighed internally and turned towards his home to leave.   Since he had completed his shopping.   It was time for him to leave the Immortal Pavilion and find a place outside the pavilion to establish his spirit field.   Soon after.   Upon returning home, He Song promptly used the Earth Tunneling Skill and the Breath Concealment Formulas to stealthily sneak out of the Immortal Pavilion, heading towards the mountains beyond the pavilion.   The Earth Tunneling Skill.   As the name suggests, it allows its user to tunnel underground, traveling beneath the earth.   However, cultivators need to potentiate to the stage of Foundation Establishment in order to possess divine sense, and use it to scan their surroundings. At the Qi Refining Stage, they can only sense their surroundings with their spirit power.   Thus, after tunneling, if they want to examine the scene above ground .   They can either pop their heads out of the ground to observe with their physical eyes.   Or they can engage their Object Controlling Skills, using their externalized spirit power to sense their surroundings.   Observing with physical eyes has numerous advantages, such as seeing further and being better at hiding due to absence of spirit power fluctuations.            Engaging Object Controlling Skills and using externalized spirit power to sense the surroundings results in minor spirit power fluctuations, with the rang of detection limited by how far the spirit power can get from the body.   Therefore.   Typically, when someone at the Qi Refining stages uses the Earth Tunneling Skill, they would pop their heads out of the ground at regular intervals to take stock of the situation.   Fortunately, Earth Tunneling Skill allows its user to pass through objects like rocks or debris, so there’s no need to worry about banging one’s head underground.   Among the mortals, the ability of Earth Tunneling Skill has been referred by the unknowing mundane folk as the ‘Wall-Passing Skill’.   Accordingly.   With He Song frequently popping his head out for observing his surroundings and continuously tunneling forwards.   He Song quickly left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion far behind, rapidly tunneling towards the northwest direction from the Pavilion.   The northwest direction of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   It’s the direction that He Song had long decided as the location for his spirit field.   Very few cultivators traversed in this direction, hence the chances of He Song’s spirit field being discovered by other cultivators was quite low once it’s been established.   Undoubtedly, it became his top choice.   Heading northwest all the way.   He Song tunneled all the way forward. Without drawing any attention from anyone, he quickly distanced himself from Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and successfullv reached a citv of the mortal world.   Salt City.   That was the name of this city of the mortal world.   He Song’s figure silently emerged from within the city without attracting anyone’s attention.   But immediately, He Song’s hand produced several silver coins and some gold grains.   Carelessly tossing these things into his storage bag, He Song stepped out from the shadows into the light. He began leisurely strolling around this unfamiliar city.   Being a transmigrator, He Song was naturally quite curious about the cities of the mortal world in this realm.   Being a cultivator, one can easily hide their identity among mortals simply by activating the Breath Concealment Formulas. They also have a strong ability to protect themselves.   There was no worry about encountering dangers from the mortal world.   So, naturally, He Song also wanted to take a good look at just how this world of the mortal was like.   If possible.   Perhaps he could even enjoy some leisure time in the mortal world apart from his cultivation.   After all, he had plenty of time and did not need to rush cultivation like the others.   Those silver coins and gold grains he had obtained were ‘picked’ from the house of a wealthy family while he tunneled under the city.    For a cultivator, gold and silver from the mortal world were easy to gain.   That was why gold and silver from the mortal world were not in circulation at the Immortal Pavilion.   If anyone did as He Song did and ‘picked’ gold and silver from the city’s wealthy houses for circulation, the pavilion might witness an instant collapse in its price levels.   Salt City was not big.   Despite frequently stopping to observe the local customs and people of this city, deepening his understanding of this world, He Song managed to tour the entire city of Salt in just a few hours.   In the end.   He Song entered a bookstore and quickly leafed through the books available. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com  A short while later.   He Song climbed to the most luxurious tavern of Salt City. Settling down at a window-side seat, he ordered a pot of tea and started to pour and sip at his leisure.   Drinking wine was not He Song’s preference.   Cultivators drinking wine seemed too vulgar.   Tea, on the other hand, was a hobby that was fitting for cultivators.   The reason he came to the tavern was merely because he noticed that in some scenarios, protagonists upon entering a tavern would hear topics about the emergence of mystical treasures, major battles between sects, and grievances of the Martial World.   Thus, He Song was here with the hope of maybe hearing some interesting news.   However, during his eavesdropping, ideas about the city he was in and the immediate mortal nations around came floating into He Song’s mind.   The information he had noted while reading books in the bookstore earlier, was currently being sorted out in his mind.   This place was known as Salt City, a city under the rule of the Great Li Dynasty.   The Great Li Dynasty, with thousands of miles of territory, included Green Wall Immortal City and several surrounding Immortal Pavilions within its vast domain.   Within this domain, the Great Li Dynasty was the ruler amidst the mortal world.   Meanwhile, Green Wall Immortal City was the colossal entity that held the strings of life and death of the Great Li Dynasty.   The area ruled by Green Wall Immortal City was precisely the territorial extent of the Great Li Dynasty.   In this world.   There are no rules that prevent cultivators from interacting with mortals.   As long as it lies within their power zone, cultivation sects and aristocratic families would support a compliant dynasty to govern the mortals within their territory.   Concurrently, they can induce within the mortals ruled by this dynasty a sense of reverence for the lofty cultivators.   If mortal individuals serendipitously obtain the opportunity to cultivate, they would flock into the Immortal Pavilion or Immortal City, becoming fresh blood for the cultivation world.   And this.   Is the reason why there are continuous additions of loose cultivators in the Immortal Pavilions and Immortal Cities.   The Great Li Dynasty, where He Song currently resides, is less a mortal dynasty and more a puppet dynasty under Green Wall Immortal City’s control.   Its existence serves to provide sufficient loose cultivators from mortal world for the Cultivation World, replenishing fresh blood..

Chapter 79: Chapter 78: Opening the Spirit Field (4/5)   Translator: 549690339   However, the royalty and nobles of the Great Li Dynasty who worked for the Thick Earth Sect enjoyed many benefits as well.   Although they didnt have Spirit Roots and couldnt cultivate immortality.   The enjoyments within the mortal world were something many cultivators could only dream of.   Great Li Dynasty I should head northwest, find a hidden corner, set up a Spirit-Gathering Array and Illusion Array, and then return to the Immortal Pavilion.   After sorting out the relationship between the Great Li Dynasty and Green Wall Immortal City in his mind, He Song sighed softly and quickly made a decision.   The existence of the Li Dynasty gave He Song a deeper understanding of this world.   In the sphere of influence of a sect or aristocratic family, almost everything was specifically designed to serve the sect or family.   There were no exceptions.   Even if it didnt seem that way.   In fact, the inner workings remained the same!   Everything in existence was deliberately designed, with a complete and very logical theoretical basis supporting it.   At the same time, he also understood something else.   The mortal world might not be a safe place either.   This was where the Thick Earth Sect replenished its fresh blood.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m   If one could hide their identity and not be discovered, they could enjoy many things in the mortal world that could not be experienced in the Cultivation World.   However, if a cultivator were to cause chaos in the mortal world, he probably wouldnt last long before a flying sword would come for his head.   Leaving a silver ingot behind, He Song didnt care about the shouting waiter behind him as he left Salt City directly.   While he was having tea, there was no useful information being relayed in the entire tavern.   This caused He Song to abandon his assumption that he was the protagonist.   When had a protagonist ever gone to a tavern for a drink and not heard any useful news?   Not to mention things like the emergence of treasures, sect wars, and tensions within the Martial World.   At the very least, with his current situation, he should have heard about a place in some remote and treacherous area, perfect for creating a spirit field, right?   Unfortunately, all he heard was some drunken people causing a ruckus and nothing more.            Having no other choice, He Song decided to leave Salt City and continue Earth Tunneling towards the northwest.   And so, after Earth Tunneling underground for several hours and covering hundreds of miles,   He Song passed by several mortal cities.   Finally, in an area of continuous mountains and forests, he found a suitable place to create a spirit field that pleased him.   It was a valley surrounded by mountains, with few signs of human activity.   Above the valley, a mist enveloped it, making it resemble a fairyland.   Inside the valley, the terrain was flat, with a clear stream running by.bender   Apart from the sparse spiritual qi, the scenery here was excellent, making it a place of clear mountains and beautiful waters.   He Song Earth Tunneled to this location, revealing his head on the ground.   Seeing this place, he immediately showed a satisfied expression on his face.   This place is perfect for creating a spirit field! With a slight smile, He Songs eyes flashed, and the whole valley scene was immediately captured in his gaze.   He didnt find any traces of fierce beasts living here, but he did find signs of animals coming to drink water.   More importantly, he didnt find any traces of cultivators staying here.   Seeing this, He Song finally relaxed and canceled his Earth Tunneling Skill, appearing on the ground.   The grass inside the valley was lush and green.   However, He Song was not in the mood to enjoy the scenery at this moment.   Instead, as soon as he emerged, two mid-grade Thick Earth Amulets and nine Array Foundations appeared in his hand.   Mid-grade Thick Earth Amulets were for defense in case someone suddenly attacked.   The nine Array Foundations were for the Illusion Array. With two mid-grade Thick Earth Amulets ready to be activated in his hand, He Songs other hand quickly formed seals and cast spells.   Quickly, the nine Array Foundations turned into rays of light and landed in their respective positions.   Soon after, a faint light flickered, and the Illusion Array was set up.   When He Song controlled the Illusion Array to cover the entire valley, he finally let out a sigh of relief, looking around with an interest in enjoying the view.   Putting away the two mid-grade Thick Earth Amulets in his hand, He Song scanned the surroundings and felt delighted.   The scenery here was superb.   Clear mountains and beautiful waters.   Its just that the spiritual qi was a bit thin.            However, for him, the thin spiritual qi was actually a good thing, as he didnt have to worry about other cultivators competing with him.   But then, He Songs delight quickly faded.   His purpose here was to create a spirit field, not to enjoy the scenery.   Even if the valley had stunning scenery, he would still transform it into a spirit field.   Shaking his head, He Song suddenly held in his hand five Array Foundations and began setting up the first Spirit-Gathering Array.   With a flash of light, He Song set up the first Spirit-Gathering Array.   However, He Song soon encountered a problem.   Once the Spirit-Gathering Array was set up, its range needed to be set for it to gather spiritual qi and lock it within that range.   The bigger the range, the more diluted the spiritual qi in the Array would be.   If the range was small, the spiritual qi in the Array would be more concentrated.   Setting a range of ten acres compared to one acre would result in a vastly different concentration of spiritual qi in the Spirit-Gathering Array.   It was not until now that He Song finally discovered that the Spirit-Gathering Array in the Immortal Pavilion was not the one he set up, rather it must have been a higher-grade, even possibly several levels higher than his.   The difference between them was too great.   It should be noted that the Spirit-Gathering Array in the Immortal Pavilion covered not only the entire Immortal Pavilion but also the spirit field outside it.   With such a huge range, the concentration of spiritual qi was still not low, fearful, it would take an even higher-grade Spirit-Gathering Array to maintain such concentration.   He Song sighed in his heart.   He casually set the range of the Spirit-Gathering Array to ten acres, then started to draw a new foundation for another Spirit-Gathering Array.   It would only be after the ten days when the power of the Spirit-Gathering Array reached its maximum that He Song could calculate how to maximize the benefits within the range covered by a single Spirit-Gathering Array.   Only then could he transform a barren field into a rich spirit field within two years.   In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.   During these ten days, He Song used the spirit stones in his storage bag to draw the foundation for four Spirit-Gathering Arrays and one Illusion Array.   The number of Array Foundations, including the losses, cost He Song more than thirty spirit stones.   There were only 35 spirit stones left in his storage bag.   He couldnt use these spirit stones.   Spirit-Gathering Arrays and Illusion Arrays both required spirit stones for their operation, and the spirit stones He Song had would only be enough to power the arrays for a year.   He would have to replace the spirit stones next year to maintain the operation of these arrays.   Fortunately, with the passing of the ten days, He Song had calculated the coverage range of the Spirit-Gathering Array..            

Chapter 80: Chapter 79: 1000 Spirit Stones (5/5)   Translator: 549690339   A Spirit-Gathering Array.   When operating at full capacity, it covers an area of two acres and a quarter. Within two years, this array can successfully convert these two acres and a quarter into a spirit field.   At the same time, due to the small coverage of the Spirit-Gathering Array, the spirit Qi is overly abundant.   As long as the area remains constant, even if He Song doesnt come here to cast the Spirit Rain Skill every day after planting the spirit rice, the spirit rice planted here can still grow smoothly.   Thats the advantage brought by the concentration of spirit Qi.   The spirit field in the Immortal Pavilion has just enough spirit Qi concentration to prevent degradation.   Therefore, the spirit rice planted on the spirit field needs spiritual plant farmers to cultivate it. They use the Spirit Rain Skill every day to temporarily increase the spirit Qi in the spirit field to facilitate the growth of the spirit rice.   For the Immortal Pavilion, the spirit Qi gathered by the Spirit-Gathering Array would surely be prioritized for Foundation Establishment Masters, followed by those in the Qi-refining late stage and places like the Spiritual Medicine Garden that require a denser spirit Qi.   After that, its for those in the Qi-refining mid stage and Qi Refining Early Stage.bender   And then, its for the spirit fields.   It can be said that the spirit Qi concentration received by the spirit fields inside the Immortal Pavilion is the lowest.   Of course, the Immortal Pavilion could also arrange a Spirit-Gathering Array every two acres and a quarter, like He Song.   But to do so would be too costly.   The Spirit-Gathering Array in Immortal Pavilion isnt like the one arranged by He Song, which only requires five spirit stones to operate at full speed for a year.   The Immortal Pavilions Spirit-Gathering Array is at a higher level. The amount of spirit Qi it gathers is incomparable to the entry-level Spirit-Gathering Array that He Song arranged.   Naturally, the consumption should be terrifying too.   In He Songs view, the cost of increasing the spirit Qi in the spirit field would definitely be higher than that of recruiting spiritual plant farmers to use Spirit Rain Skill every day.   Otherwise, the Immortal Pavilion would have done so a long time ago.   The Immortal Pavilion probably wouldnt recruit spiritual plant farmers to tend to the spirit fields anymore.   After understanding this point, He Song pondered for a moment before quickly arranging three more Spirit-Gathering Arrays in the valley.   Ten days ago.   He Song had arranged a Spirit-Gathering Array in this place. Now, with the additional three arrays, he had a total of four Spirit-Gathering Arrays.   With the four Spirit-Gathering Arrays in place, the combined area covered was ten acres.   Ten acres.   It can be fully transformed into spirit fields after two years.   Ten acres of spirit fields. Each acre of spirit field can produce a thousand catty of spirit rice per year, totaling to ten thousand catty of spirit rice. If the price is calculated at 10 catty of spirit rice per spirit stone, ten thousand catty of spirit rice can sell for a thousand spirit stones!   A thousand spirit stones!    After deducting the annual operating costs of the four Spirit-Gathering Arrays, an Illusion Array, and a Five Phases Array, there would still be a net profit of over nine hundred spirit stones.   After calculating it in his mind, a trace of joy flashed in He Songs eyes.   A thousand spirit stones.   If calculated based on his current annual salary, it would be enough for him to save for about ten years.   But now,   He just needs to wait until two years later when he could arrange the Five Phases Array. Then he can plant spirit rice here, and his annual income would reach 1,000 spirit stones!   By then, his income for one year would be equal to his income for ten years now.   Even,   If he opened up several more spirit fields like this in other places it wouldnt be impossible to have an annual income of several thousand spirit stones.   If it really came to that,   With his annual income of several thousand spirit stones,   Even with the extremely expensive Foundation Establishment Elixir, which attracts countless cultivators to compete for it, hed be able to obtain them effortlessly!   By that time   He Song quickly regained composure and forcibly calmed himself down.   Its still early.   Its still early.   These things would have to wait until two years later when he could arrange the Five Phases Array. Only then would they start to become a reality.   Nowadays, he was just a fifth-tier Qi Refining cultivator, with an annual salary of just over a hundred spirit stones.   Thinking so much was useless.   It was better to calm down and slowly comprehend the Five Phases Array.   When everything was ripe, he could make the next step.   His gaze swept around.   The four Spirit-Gathering Arrays had started to operate, forcibly confining wisps of spirit Qi within their scope and merging them into the soil below.   Seeing this, He Song frowned.   The valley was still green at the moment.   Since he did not know how much area the four Spirit-Gathering Arrays could cover previously, He Song had not cleared any land in advance.   But now, after determining the coverage of the Spirit-Gathering Arrays, it was time to prepare ten acres of land.   With that thought, he acted.   He Song used Object Controlling Skills and instantly turned over a large patch of grass, revealing the dark soil beneath.    The dark soil indicated fertile land, which was excellent for planting spirit fields.   After a while,   It took He Songs spirit power and Object Controlling Skills to finally prepare the ten acres of land covered by the Spirit -Gathering Arrays.   At this moment,   The originally green valley now had an additional ten-acre field, while the surrounding area was still verdant grass. Seeing this, He Song nodded slightly.   Next,   He just needed to wait for two years until these ten acres of land were completely transformed into a spirit field.   After comprehending the Five Phases Array, he could come here and start planting spirit rice.   By that time,   He would no longer worry about spirit stones.   He wouldnt have to begrudge using spirit stones like now, wishing he could split each in half to spend.   After putting all the spirit stones needed for the arrays in the valley to run normally for a year, He Songs figure submerged underground and quickly headed towards Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   This place,   Was hundreds of miles away from the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   He Song remembered the direction and made some marks. Next year, he would return to replenish the spirit stones for the five arrays here.   That day, He Song returned to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   And he took back the responsibility of managing the Medicine Garden from Wei Fan.   Nobody noticed He Songs departure from the Immortal Pavilion apart from himself.   Even Wei Fan and the others in the Medicine Garden only knew that He Song had been in seclusive cultivation these days.   But, all they knew were these.   He Songs departure from the Immortal Pavilion was unknown to anyone.   Since leaving the Immortal Pavilion, having a walk around the mortal city, and opening up ten acres of his own spirit field hundreds of miles away from the Pavilion, He Songs life had calmed down again.   On normal days, he would guard the Medicine Garden during the daytime and use the rich spirit Qi in the garden to improve his cultivation.   At night, he would return home and constantly study the Five Phases Array, hoping to quickly master it and set it up.   However, even though he was still diligently studying Array Tao Introduction, He Songs attention shifted to other skills.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com   Amulet making, elixir refinement, artifacts refinement, beast taming   After pondering these money-making skills, He Song decided to learn one.   Not for any other reason, but merely to launder spirit stones.   Yes! Spirit stones needed laundering too.   However, the laundering mentioned here did not refer to washing with water as literally understood.   But rather.

Chapter 81: Chapter 80: Two Years (1/5)   Translator: 549690339   Instead of putting on a show for others, he turned the profits he earned from his spirit field into spirit stones earned through his skill.   In this way, showing off another craft would prevent people from suspecting the source of his spirit stones.   He hid his most powerful thing.   Then deliberately revealed something less important to cover the most potent one.   He Song had seen such methods many times, so naturally, he used them with ease.   If he wanted to use the huge amount of spirit stones from his spirit field without raising suspicion,   learning another craft that seemed normal in the eyes of others and wouldnt attract too much covetousness would be the best choice.   After some contemplation,   He Song eventually settled on the profession of an amulet tao master.   Choosing an amulet tao master   Was not for any other reason,   It was because the spirit amulets drawn by an amulet tao master could be combined with array tao.   Array tao methods are used to engrave array patterns on a carrier, while amulet tao methods are used to inscribe amulet seals on a carrier.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m   Although array patterns and amulet seals are not from the same origin, learning one method means grasping many. He Song, who had already learned to engrave array patterns, could make rapid progress when studying amulet seals again.   Being able to quickly learn to make spirit amulets meant that He Song could quickly explain the source of his spirit stones.   You should know that,   in two years, He Song would be able to fully control the deployment of the Five Phases Array.   Once the Five Phases Array could be successfully deployed, the spirit field that He Song had opened up would also quickly bring him huge spirit stone benefits.   At this moment, if he wanted to learn another one of the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth to cover the origin of his spirit stones, speed naturally became the first thing He Song needed to consider.   For other techniques like elixir refinement, artifact refinement, and beast taming, it would take He Song a long time to research them to the extent of earning spirit stones.   For example, it would be like array tao.   at least starting with three years.   As for amulet tao, since he had an early foundation, He Song might be able to grasp it within two years and start to show his amulet tao master identity.   At that time,   He Song will have just sown his first crop of spirit rice.   a year later, the spirit rice matures and harvests 10,000 catties of spirit rice,   At the same time, He Songs identity as an amulet tao master could provide the most significant cover for the sudden massive amount of spirit stones.   As an amulet tao master,    Whats the problem with having more spirit stones?   These spirit stones are earned by painstakingly making and selling amulets.   Moreover, since there are many amulet tao masters in the Cultivation World, a Qi refining amulet tao master wont draw too much attention.   In addition, the income of an amulet tao master is quite considerable and would not raise suspicion on the source of He Songs spirit stones.   In this way, an amulet tao master became He Songs first choice.   As for other skills in the Hundred Skills of Cultivating Truth, they could be studied later if leisure time is available. After all, the thing he lacks the least is time.   Nevertheless,   Although he had already chosen to be an amulet tao master as his public identity,   He Song looked at the few spirit stones in his storage bag and couldnt help feeling a little helpless.   No more sDirit stones!   When he opened his spirit field, he deployed a total of five arrays there, four Spirit-Gathering Array and one Illusion Array.   The remaining Spirit-Gathering Array and Illusion Array were brought back by him.   Immortal Pavilion required arrays for maintenance as well.   The five arrays in the spirit field needed to consume twenty-five spirit stones   every year.   At that time, He Song had only a little over thirty spirit stones left on him.   When he returned from opening the spirit field, He Song had only more than a dozen spirit stones left on him.   Moreover, these more than a dozen spirit stones still needed ten spirit stones to maintain the operation of the Spirit-Gathering Array and Illusion Array in the quiet room.   One could say,   If He Song hadnt kept a few spirit stones on him, he would have had to starve.   Not to mention spirit rice, he probably wouldnt even be able to eat mortal rice.   To study amulet tao, one needs to buy the Amulet Tao Introduction for a hundred spirit stones,   Amulet paper, amulet pen, and amulet ink all need to be bought.   After purchasing so many things, He Song secretly calculated that it would probably take more than a hundred spirit stones to be enough.   After a long contemplation,   Forget it, forget it, its only two years late. At worst, I can store the spirit rice I plant first, and when I learned to make amulets, I can sell it.   Shaking his head, He Song let out a light sigh, with a faint expression of helplessness on his face.   There was no other choice, who could have known that his annual salary would be so low?   It wasnt until he needed to use spirit stones that He Song realized his annual income of more than a hundred spirit stones wasnt enough to spend.   At the same time, he also prepared to store the spirit rice once it was planted and sell it later.    Otherwise, if he sold it prematurely, it would be a real loss if the massive amount of spirit stones from unknown sources attracted attention.   To be more cautious, He Song eventually chose to wait.   Just wait a little.   and the risk could be minimized.   Even if his profits couldnt be maximized, it didnt matter.   After all,   As an everlasting being,   What He Song lacked the least was time.   Only those with short lives need to make every moment count.   For He Song, Time   has never been scarce.   For things with risks that could be reduced over time, He Song would carry them out without hesitation.   After making the decision, He Song devoted himself to studying the deployment method of the Five Phases Array.   As the first killing array and defensive array method that He Song studied, the deployment difficulty of the Five Phases Array was significantly higher than that of the Spirit-Gathering Array and Illusion Array.   This was also the reason why He Song, who had already learned two array methods and had some experience in array deployment, still needed three years to learn the Five Phases Array deployment.   Time flies,   Years go by.   In the blink of an eye, two years have passed.   During these two years, Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was not calm.   Though He Song was in the Immortal Pavilion every day, the news that sometimes came from the outside world made him understand the situation around the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Ever since three years ago, when the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team left the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and were attacked, resulting in three deaths and two severe injuries, the law enforcement team of Green Wall Immortal City launched several encirclements against the Evil Cultivators.   Unfortunately,   There was no Foundation Establishment Master sitting in Green Wall Immortal Citys Law Enforcement Team.   In the multiple confrontations with the Evil Cultivators, the cultivators of   Green Wall Immortal Citys Law Enforcement Team suffered significant losses.   But the deaths and injuries on the Evil Cultivators side were even more substantial.   Now, three years have passed, and the struggle between the Law Enforcement Team of Green Wall Immortal City and the Evil Cultivators has not yet ended, It even seemed to intensify.   This can be seen from the fact that the Law Enforcement Team of Green Wall Immortal City began to recruit loose cultivators to join them in Green Wall Immortal City.bender   The Evil Cultivators were strong, and the Green Wall Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, if not short-handed, would not openly recruit loose cultivators in Green Wall Immortal City.   When He Song first heard this news, he was surprised at the number and combat power of the Evil Cultivators. But surprise was just surprise,   This matter had little impact on He Song.   During the two years in the Immortal Pavilion, He Song only went out once..

Chapter 82: Chapter 81: Five Phases Array (2/5)   Translator: 549690339   That time, he went to change the spirit stones for the five arrays in the spirit field.   Apart from that, He Song had been staying within the Immortal Pavilion all the time, not stepping out of its gates.   He devoted himself entirely to the study of the Five Phases Array.   Fortunately.   The two years passed in the blink of an eye, and He Song finally comprehended the Five Phases Array and could now arrange it.   Inside the quiet room.   He Song put the Array Foundation he held into his storage bag, a smile appearing on his face. Two years had passed.   Finally!   The last Array Foundation of the Five Phases Array had been engraved.   Now.   As long as wanted, he could arrange a Five Phases Array, both offensive and defensive, anywhere.   Once a cultivator who doesnt understand arrays enters this array, they will face continuous Array attacks.   Although the attack power is only at the Qi-refining mid-stage level.   But if the Five Phases Array has enough spirit Qi supply, the continuous attacks will eventually overwhelm even late-stage Qi-refining cultivators in the endless onslaught.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com   If the Illusion Arrays mind-confusing function was added, even if they wanted to escape, they wouldnt be able to discern east from west, only dying trapped within the array.   Even if they didnt enter the array and attacked the Five Phases Array from the outside, the arrays defensive capabilities would force the majority of Qi Refining cultivators to retreat in vain.   Giving He Song valuable time to escape.   Good, good, good, the final part of the three major entry-tier arrays is finally completed. Next, its time to start cultivating the spirit field, He Song said as he stood up from the cushion, a hint of joy flashing across his face.   Over the two years.   He Song not only successfully comprehended the Five Phases Array.   His cultivation had also made a significant step forward from the fifth-tier Qi Refining.   According to He Songs estimation, his cultivation would break through to the sixth-tier Qi Refining within a year.   By that time.   He Songs focus should be on improving his cultivation and his combat prowess.   When he started selling the spirit rice.   His spirit stones would gradually increase.   Defensive measures, various spirit amulets, middle-grade Artifacts, he wanted them all!   Before that, He Song, after some thought, still decided to first purchase the Amulet Tao Introduction and learn it as soon as possible to serve as his superficial identity.    Two years had passed.   He Song had already received his annual salary twice in the Immortal Pavilion.   At this moment, his assets had reached more than two hundred spirit stones.   More than 200 spirit stones should be enough for him to make some purchases.   With that thought, He Song went straight out the door towards the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   However, when he took the spirit stones to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to purchase the Amulet Tao Introduction, he found that the person receiving him was not Pinger, but other receptionists from the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   He was slightly confused but didnt ask further, only inquiring briefly and learning that Pinger had left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and seemed to have gone to some Immortal City.   After learning all this, He Song shook his head.   In past two years, he hadnt been to the Spirit Skill Pavilion, nor had he received any sound-transmitting paper cranes from Pinger.   He hadnt met Pinger either.   He didnt know when she had left.   But it didnt bother him much either, as the saying goes, if theres fate, they would meet again.   With 100 spirit stones spent.   All information about the Amulet Tao Introduction appeared in He Songs mind.   After purchasing the Amulet Tao Introduction, He Song went to the Stall Section outside the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   Stall Section.   He Songs gaze swept around, quickly stopping at a stall selling spirit amulets. This stall had spirit amulets, amulet paper, amulet ink, and amulet pens, all available in abundance.   He Song bought a pen, a stack of amulet paper, and a small bottle of amulet ink, spending a total of seventy spirit stones.   The lower-grade Ghost Wolf Amulet Brush cost fifty spirit stones per pen.   Lower-grade amulet paper was ten stones per stack, with ten sheets in one stack.   The lower-grade amulet ink was ten stones per bottle, with only enough ink in one bottle to draw ten lower-grade spirit amulets.   A total of seventy spirit stones.   After buying these items, He Song left the Stall Section with a pained expression.   It couldnt be helped.bender   These things were just too expensive.   He had saved up for two years and had only received 200 spirit stones, yet in such a short time, he had already spent 170 spirit stones.   With such a massive consumption, He Song couldnt help but feel extremely grateful that he had chosen Array Tao first instead of Amulet Tao.   If he had taken the Amulet Tao with its high consumption rates and based on his annual salary at that time, he might not have been able to afford it.   It was good that he had made the right choice.   He had chosen Array Tao.    Otherwise, where would he be able to see the hope of earning a thousand spirit stones a year now?   He would probably still be filling the bottomless pit of Amulet Tao, right?   After purchasing the Array Tao Introduction and the necessary amulet paper, amulet pen, and amulet ink, He Song returned home.   In the time he spent comprehending the Five Phases Array in the past two years, He Song did not idle in preparing for his spirit field.   For example, the spirit rice seeds.   He Song managed to obtain some using his job position.   Although not many, it should be enough for ten acres of spirit field cultivation.   Spirit rice seeds were well-known by spiritual plant farmers: once acquired, if there were no seeds for later cultivation, they could retain seeds for themselves from the grown spirit rice.   In the Cultivation World, there is no such thing as seed monopoly.   If spirit rice seeds could only be planted once, to plant again, new seeds would have to be purchased.   If such a thing were to happen, the Ancestor Yuanying would probably come knocking the very next day.   Having obtained the spirit rice seeds.   Having the Five Phases Array.   And having purchased the Amulet Tao Introduction as well as its related items.   After some thought, He Song found himself fully prepared.   He casually set up a small mechanism in the quiet room to prevent anyone from entering after he left.   Then, he directly used Earth Tunneling Skill in the quiet room, leaving the Immortal Pavilion quietly.   A few hours later.   He Songs head emerged from a corner in a valley.   He looked around and saw no traces of others having been here, and after using his Spirit Vision Skill, he did not find anyone elses presence. Only then did           let out a sigh of relief.   He canceled the Earth Tunneling Skill, and his figure appeared in the valley.   At this moment.   The valley was filled with lush green grass, a small stream flowing by, presenting a picturesque landscape of clear mountains and waters.   He Songs gaze swept over his ten-acre spirit field, a satisfied look on his face.   However, his hands didnt rest.   As spirit stones turned into streams of light flying out from He Songs hands, they were embedded in the arrays that he had placed. Soon, the five arrays here that had been operating all the time received spirit stone replenishments and could continue functioning for another year.   After replenishing the spirit stones for the arrays here, He Song walked forward and, within the range of the Spirit-Gathering Array, picked up a handful of soil.   After careful sensing.   He Song could only feel strands of spirit Qi continuously flowing through the soil in his hand.   He released it, picked up another handful, and sensed it carefully again.   Seeing that it remained the same.   He Song stood up, satisfied, feeling elated in his heart..

Chapter 83: Chapter 82: Ten Acres of Spirit Field (3/5)   Translator: 549690339   Two years had passed.   Under He Song’s arrangement of four Spirit-Gathering Arrays, the once ordinary ten-acre plot of land had been successfully transformed into a spirit field.   The spirit Qi circulated ceaselessly within the soil, which was a unique characteristic of spirit fields. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates  Only in such soil could spirit rice thrive.   This meant…   After all these years of planning,   He Song’s plan to grow spirit fields outside and increase his income was officially on track!   Now, all He Song needed to do was plant the spirit rice seeds, and as time went by, the hidden ten-acre spirit field would yield nearly a thousand spirit stones of income for He Song each year!   With such a huge windfall, He Song would no longer struggle with a lack of spirit stones, as he had in the past.   Furthermore, with enough spirit stones, he could enjoy the most luxurious cultivation environment.   Elixirs for cultivation improvement? Buy them!   Cultivation-improving tea leaves? Buy them!   Cultivation-boosting foods? Buy them!   Cultivation-boosting…   In short,   As long as He Song’s spirit field started producing, He Song would never lack cultivation resources.   A scene of drinking tea and eating meals all for cultivation improvement flashed through He Song’s mind, and with a wave of his hand, the Eighteen Foundations of Array Skill appeared.   This was the Array Foundation of the Five Phases Array.   It was different from the Array Foundation of the Spirit-Gathering Array, which involved only five arrays.   It was also different from the Nine Array Foundation of the Illusion Array.   The Five Phases Array, as an offensive and defensive array, required eighteen Foundations of Array Skill.   These eighteen Array Foundations were He Song’s greatest gains over the past two years.   With a flick of the finger,   Under He Song’s directions, the Eighteen Foundations of Array Skill quickly turned into streaks of light, flying in all directions.   Shortly, with a flash of faint light, the Five Phases Array was laid out by He Song.   Feeling the slight murderous aura intertwined with the Five Phases Array, He Song’s heart eased.   With the protection of the Five Phases Array,   Even if the spirit field was discovered by others, He Song would not have to worry about his safety.            Even if someone were to block him in the valley,   As long as the Five Phases Array was present, He Song could either flee or launch a surprise attack with great effect.   Furthermore,   If the valley was discovered while he was away,   With the Five Phases Array, if the intruder was careless or low in cultivation, they might even die in the array.   Maybe the next time he returned, he would find a cultivator’s corpse and storage bag in the valley?   The idea crossed He Song’s mind, but he quickly shook it off.   It did not matter if a cultivator died.   What he feared was if a junior died, a senior would come.   If that were to happen, He Song would immediately move everything from here to another location.   Even if it came at some cost, it would be worth it.   In the Cultivation World,   Caution was always the best policy.   With this thought in mind,   He Song manipulated the Five Phases Array to cover the entire valley, then began to manipulate the Illusion Array.   The coverage area of the Illusion Array had to be larger than that of the Five Phases Array.   Otherwise, someone might step out before getting mentally confused and turn back from the Illusion Array, only to fall into the Five Phases Array and be killed by it.   He Song did not want this to happen, so naturally, the coverage area of the Illusion Array needed adjustments.   Soon,   He Song had completely adjusted the coverage area of the Illusion Array.   At this point, He Song had mastered the three major entry-tier arrays; as long as he drew the corresponding Array Foundations, he could deploy the complete array.   After completing all of this, He Song let out a sigh of relief.   Next, a big bag appeared in his hand.   The bag was large, not a storage bag, but an ordinary one.   In the span of these two years, all spirit rice seeds He Song had obtained by taking advantage of his position were in this bag.   Opening the bag, used the Object Controlling Skills to instantly scatter the entire bag of spirit rice seeds and sprinkled them into the ten-acre spirit field according to the planting methods.   Having done all this, He Song threw the bag away, finally allowing himself to breathe a sigh of relief.   The spirit rice had been planted.   There was an abundance of spirit Qi here, so there was no need to cast the Spirit Rain Skill daily.   There was also a small stream nearby, ensuring a constant water supply.            He Song just needed to visit once a year, replenish the spirit stones for the array, harvest the spirit rice, and sow the seeds for the following year.   Visit once a year.   No need to worry about anything else.   An annual income of a thousand spirit stones.   Such a low-risk, low-investment, yet high-income venture was possible only because He Song himself was an Array Path Master.   If it were any other cultivator, just inviting an Array Path Master to arrange the three major arrays would require massive resources, and there was no guarantee they would be able to find one.   “It’s good that I didn’t choose any other Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth back then, or else I wouldn’t have come this far,” He Song quietly sighed as he looked at the lingering mist above the valley.   At first,   He chose the array tao because it did not require start-up capital.   Although he spent many spirit stones drawing Array Foundations during his studies of array tao, the spirit Qi generated from the shattered spirit stones was absorbed by himself.   In this way, the spirit Qi was not wasted, and his cultivation improved rapidly.   Meanwhile, other Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth would lose everything once a mistake was made.   For example, Amulet Tao.   If the drawing of amulets failed, the amulet paper and ink would be rendered unusable.   Elixir refinement was similar.   Once failed, the materials in the elixir furnace could not be salvaged.   The same applied to artifact refinement and Beast Taming.   Only in array tao could a cultivator absorb the enormous amount of spirit Qi generated from shattered stones when the drawing of Array Foundations failed, which could somewhat speed up their cultivation progress.   With one last look at the peaceful and beautiful valley,   He Song quickly vanished into the ground again, rapidly heading towards the Immortal Pavilion.   Visiting once a year, replenishing the spirit stones for the array, and harvesting spirit rice would be enough here. His primary focus,   Should still be placed on the Immortal Pavilion.   After all, only in the Immortal Pavilion could He Song’s cultivation and combat prowess be rapidly elevated.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Without alerting anyone, He Song returned to the Immortal Pavilion from hundreds of miles away.   Coming and going,   Didn’t even require a full day.   Half a day was more than enough.   Fortunately, He Song had picked an appropriate day before leaving, as he was not needed at the Medicine Garden today.   Thus, his departure from the Immortal Pavilion did not raise any suspicions.   Even Wei Fan and He Song’s neighbors had no idea of his whereabouts.   Back in his quiet chamber,   He Song checked the small mechanism he had set up before leaving, and upon finding that it had not been triggered, he finally let out a sigh of relief..        

Chapter 84: Chapter 83: Abnormal Behavior (4/5)   Translator: 549690339   As long as the small mechanism was not triggered, it meant that no one had entered the quiet room during his absence, which was to say, No one knew that He Song had gone out during this period.   He put away the small mechanism.   He Song quickly immersed himself in cultivation and the study of the Amulet Tao Introduction.   Amulet Tao Introduction.   Similar to the Array Tao Introduction, it recorded the production methods of only three spirit amulets.   “This is the Amulet Tao Introduction, which contains the production techniques of the Thick Earth Amulet, Golden Sword Amulet, and Divine   Movement Amulet, and various common knowledge about amulet making.”   In his mind, he recalled the words Ping’er had told him about the Amulet Tao Introduction a long time ago.   He Song then began to study the production methods of spirit amulets in the Amulet Tao Introduction.   Using an amulet pen to draw patterns on amulet paper with amulet ink, this is called amulet seal.   Amulet seal and array patterns have similarities.   Not many.   But it was enough for He Song to get started quickly.   Now that the spirit field he had opened up outside was on the right track,   it was time to study the Amulet Tao Introduction and use his identity as an amulet Tao master to make his spirit stone earnings less conspicuous.   In the Cultivation World, if someone who doesn’t know the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth and has weak fighting abilities suddenly becomes rich, it will definitely attract the attention of others.   Suspicion, jealousy, greed, threat,   All kinds of gazes would gather on this person.   They would not rest until they had unearthed the secret.   But if an amulet Tao master suddenly becomes rich, people would only think that his skill is strong and he sells a large number of spirit amulets.   At the same time, since he is an amulet Tao master, he would naturally have many amulets on him, and generally, cultivators of the same level facing him would be suppressed by the endless spirit amulets on him, unable to catch their breath.   If they were not careful, they might even be killed directly.   Having the ability to protect himself, an amulet Tao master becoming rich wouldn’t attract too many covetous gazes.   This was also one of the reasons He Song chose amulet making.   Nowadays, the spirit field can bring He Song an income of one thousand spirit   stones a year. Witnout navmg to worry aDout spirit stones, He song would naturally study things that could enhance his own strength. With power, he can survive better in the face of danger.   However,   Just as He Song was constantly studying the Amulet Tao Introduction and progressing rapidly,   Outside of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion,    The struggle between the evil cultivators and the Green Wall Immortal City Law Enforcement Team had become increasingly fierce.   News from the outside world came from time to time.   For example, at some point, the two sides fought fiercely in a certain place, and even mortal cities were affected.   At some point, evil cultivators attacked members of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, causing casualties.   In addition, Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com  There was also news of Immortal City cultivators destroying evil cultivators’ gathering place,   But it was unknown whether it was true or false.   He Song listened,   but his heart was full of confusion.   Evil cultivators,   In He Song’s view, were just some loose cultivators who couldn’t survive.   They might have a perverse personality and stop at nothing in their actions, even doing anything for resources.   But… not a single evil cultivator is a fool.   Directly confronting the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, did they feel that the Foundation Establishment masters in Green Wall Immortal City weren’t sharp enough?   Or did they just lose their minds and want to stab the Law Enforcement Team in the back?   Weren’t they all the types who wouldn’t cast their nets until they saw the prey?   Could they really do something that carries no benefits and puts their life in danger?   This made He Song somewhat puzzled.   However, since it had little to do with him, He Song didn’t give it much thought.   But once, during the monthly gathering of his small circle of friends, He Song heard the answer from Wei Fan. Spirit Construction Pavilion.   Second floor.   In an antique-style room,   He Song and Wei Fan sat facing each other, with two freshly brewed cups of tea in front of them.   The tea aroma filled the room, and the air in the entire room was imbued with a hint of tea scent.   When He Song casually brought up the matter as a joke, Wei Fan pondered for a while and then replied,   “As far as I know, evil cultivators usually act alone, and only a small part of them would gather together for warmth. Such a rampant season of evil cultivators has not been seen in the records of Thick Earth Mansion.”   “However, I read in a book a long time ago that there is always a large force behind a large-scale gathering of evil cultivators.”   After hearing Wei Fan’s words, He Song’s original careless thoughts vanished.   Evil cultivators,   Gathering,   The force behind them,    These words, when taken separately, were not eye-catching,   But when connected together, they made He Song’s mind flash with images.   It’s still the same old saying,   There are no new things under the sun.   Having experienced an era of information explosion in his previous life, He Song could keenly observe the essence of any matter.   In this case, the doubts in his heart were also justified.   He Song’s eyes glittered, feeling that even the Immortal Pavilion had suddenly become dangerous.   The Immortal Pavilion had a Foundation Establishment master in charge, which was usually safe and sound,   Moreover, the spirit Qi here was much richer than the outside, which naturally made it the best place for He Song to settle down.   But,   When evil cultivators, contrary to their usual behavior, started to harden up against the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team,   And after several battles between the Law Enforcement Team and the evil cultivators, neither side had gained any advantage,   The suspicion that there must be a large force supporting the evil cultivators behind them took root in He Song’s mind.   So, what is the purpose of the force behind the evil cultivators?   They couldn’t possibly support the evil cultivators without reason and let them openly confront the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team.   This would come at a cost,   Those evil cultivators, each of them the kind to not cast their nets until they saw the prey, how could so many of them risk their lives to confront the Law Enforcement Team if they weren’t given any benefits?   If there is no gain, then such a huge cost is indeed unwise, so,   What is their purpose?   As his thoughts tumbled in his mind, He Song looked involuntarily at the central location of the Immortal Pavilion. There,   Was the residence of Master Cheng Shan.   And it was also the safest place in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   However, after contemplating for a while, He Song still had no clue in his mind.   Could it be that the large force behind the evil cultivators would send Foundation Establishment attackers to the Immortal Pavilion?   He Song was surprised by a speculation that suddenly appeared in his mind, but immediately shook his head again,   Foundation Establishment masters shouldn’t be so easy to kill, right?   But you can’t be too sure, what if Master Cheng Shan really runs away without a fight?   Perhaps, it’s time for him to find an escape route for himself as well.   He Song thought to himself,   The information he could access was too little to analyze anything,   Instead of making baseless guesses here, he should wait and collect more information before making a judgment.   With a sigh,   He Song looked at Wei Fan,   “Wei, from now on, if you get any news, be sure to notify me at the first time. I always feel uneasy in my heart..”

Chapter 85: Chapter 84: Digging Deeper (5/5)   Translator: 549690339   As a top-tier member of the Immortal Pavilion, Wei Fan had access to information channels that were beyond He Song’s reach.   Now, if he wanted to gather more information, He Song could only rely on Wei   Fan.   However, while he expressed this thought, He Song already made a decision in his heart.   Currently, even with a Foundation Establishment master stationed at the Immortal Pavilion making it countless times safer than the outside world.   But not knowing what the powerful force behind the Evil Cultivator was seeking, after a moment of thought, He Song still decided to leave himself a way out.   No matter if Wei Fan could bring him useful information or not.   Nor whether Master Cheng Shan would fight for Immortal Pavilion when a   crisis came.   In short.   When chaos started to rise in the outside world, He Song’s first priority was to ensure his own safety.   As for the others, He Song only had two friends left in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, Wei Fan and Zhao Lin, the rest had already gone to Green Wall Immortal City.   People like his neighbor Lin Cong, and the old man Meng Guan, had told him when they communicated with him, that they had already settled down in Green Wall Immortal City.   Since they could settle down in the Immortal City, there was no need for He Song to worry about them.   He Song was happy to lend a helping hand to his friends when it did not affect himself.   Just like how Wei Fan protected him behind his back when He Song couldn’t protect himself.   But if it would affect him or other people needed help.   Then, sorry.   All considerations had to be made with He Song’s own safety in mind.   If he really can’t help his friends, or if he forcibly helps and it affects his own safety, He Song could only regretfully remain powerless.   At least.   When his power gets stronger in the future.   He could always avenge his friends, if needed.   Anyway, as long as there’s enough time, He Song’s strength would surely continue to grow.   Nevertheless, such a situation is unlikely to occur.            Because whether it is Wei Fan or Zhao Lin, their strengths are stronger than He Song’s at this time.   If they can’t protect themselves and want to seek help, He Song probably can’t help them.   “Alright, since you said so, I will pay attention to this sort of information. If there are any movements, I will definitely inform you in advance, ” Wei Fan quickly agreed after seeing He Song’s expression suddenly turning serious.   He knew that his friend was, indeed, a bit overly cautious.   But, since He Song had spoken, it was just keeping an eye out for some information, and that was no big deal. He was more than happy to help.   Also, Wei Fan, who was very familiar with He Song’s personality, saw something unusual in He Song’s expression.   For a moment, Wei Fan also began to be vigilant about the Evil Cultivator.   After that.   Every day, while comprehending the Amulet Tao Introduction and practicing, He Song added one more thing.   Digging a tunnel!   Because this world possesses the Earth Tunneling Skill, as well as the Earthshaking Skill, which are specifically aimed at the ground.   He Song couldn’t confirm that if his guess might come true, the big power behind the Evil Cultivator would send a Foundation Establishment Master to attack the Immortal Pavilion, could he use the Earth Tunneling Skill to escape at that time?   But, He Song dared not gamble.   Since this world possessed Earth Tunneling Skill and Earthshaking Skill, could the divine sense of Foundation Establishment Master probe under the ground?   What if, during his escape, He Song was suddenly located by the divine sense of the Foundation Establishment Master?   Wouldn’t he be buried without a place to lie?   For his own safety’s sake, He Song felt that digging a deep hole under his room as a backup plan was a much safer option.   It wasn’t that he didn’t want to leave the Immortal Pavilion directly to avoid a possible Foundation Establishment attack.   But.   At present, nothing had been implied, He Song did not know if his guess would come true.   If it does come true, and he hasn’t had time to run by then, having a hole here would make He Song feel a little safer.   Due to his limited information, unable to judge whether his guess was right or wrong, He Song couldn’t guarantee that he would have time to run.   But if there were definite news, or signs of an impending crisis, He Song would immediately choose to leave, rather than hoping that the hole he dug could save his life.   The reason he dug this hole was to be prepared for the unexpected.   It was only one of his escape routes.   Although it was carefully made, it did not mean that this hole would definitely come in handy.   The hole that He Song dug was somewhat special.   It wasn’t the kind that went straight up and down.            From above, even the floor inside He Song’s room was perfectly intact.   From the ground to several meters below, it was all solid. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com  Earth Tunneling Skill.   With He Song’s current fifth-tier Qi Refining cultivation, under extreme conditions, he could tunnel about five meters underground and travel at an extremely high speed underground.   If it were a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator, according to He Song’s estimate, under extreme conditions, they could tunnel about ten meters underground. When He Song was digging the hole, he first tunneled five meters underground.   When he felt that he couldn’t go down any further, He Song used his storage bag to collect the soil around him into the storage bag.   The space inside the storage bag had been cleared out by He Song, without any items, specifically used to contain soil.   In this way, He Song dug out a space about five meters underground, enough for a person to hunched his back.   As long as He Song curled up, he could barely make do in this space.   Next up, was to continue digging downwards.   While digging, filling the soil on the ceiling.   Ensuring that the soil layer above his head was always solid.   Not until he dug dozens of meters underground and created a room-sized space, stocked with some food and other things, was the construction truly completed.   If there was a hole like this.   So, if one day He Song was really trapped in the Immortal Pavilion.   He could use the Earth Tunneling Skill to tunnel five meters underground, then just like when he was digging the hole, while digging downward, he could fill the soil on the ceiling.   When he reaches the room-sized space that he has opened up, he can arrange the array skills.   In this way, even if the divine sense of the Foundation Establishment Master scans, it would probably not be able to scan dozens of meters underground.   After all, the soil below was filled by himself, just a normal layer of soil without any flaws.   As for the search by a Qi Refining stage cultivator.   That was even less likely to find He Song.   Who would think that He Song, in order to save his life, would dig a hole that is dozens of meters deep to hide in?   The Evil Cultivator could only come and leave with nothing achieved.   Only, while digging the hole, He Song was a bit dissatisfied with his storage bag.   This storage bag was too small.   Even the soil couldn’t be stored much, the soil dug out need to be transported out by himself over and over again.   But thankfully there was the Earth Tunneling Skill. Running a few more times was not a big deal.   The tunnel digging operation lasted for more than ten days.   After more than ten days, when the tunnel was completely formed, He Song no longer paid attention to it.   The tunnel was merely an escape route that He Song, out of caution, left for himself.   If things turn unfavorable, he would certainly run if he could..        

Chapter 86: Chapter 85: Sixth- tier Qj Refining (1/5)   Translator: 549690339   As for whether it could be used or not.   He Song was not quite sure himself.   After leaving himself a way out, He Song spent his days studying Amulet Tao Introduction, besides his daily cultivation.   It must be said that, having already learned the Array Tao Introduction, He Song’s understanding of Amulet Tao Introduction was incredibly fast.   According to He Song’s calculations, he would only need about a year to fully comprehend the Amulet Tao Introduction.   By then, it would be time to get started on the actual practice.   Another year spent amulet making, by then, he should be able to earn spirit stones using Amulet Tao.   Starting with the low-quality Thick Earth Amulet, then low-quality Golden Light Amulet and low-quality Divine Movement Amulet.   When the success rate of making low-quality spirit amulets reached a certain level, he would try to make mid-level spirit amulets.   Amulet Tao Introduction.   It was quite different from Array Tao Introduction.   Although the Amulet Tao Introduction only contained three types of spirit amulet making methods, these three types of spirit amulets were divided into low-quality, mid-quality, and high-quality, corresponding to Qi Refining Early Stage, Qi-refining mid stage, and Qi-refining late stage.   That is to say.   Purchasing Amulet Tao Introduction would enable one to learn the making methods of these three types of spirit amulets at low, medium, and high-quality levels.   Compared to Array Tao Introduction, which only recorded three types of Array Skills, Amulet Tao Introduction was more cost-effective.   However, this was probably because spirit amulets were consumable items.   Also, Entry into the array tao required array tao talent, and those without talent, even after decades of study, might not be able to attain entry. (Refer to Chapter 17 for explanation)   Different difficulties.   Different gains.   Naturally, there was a gap between Amulet Tao Introduction and Array Tao Introduction.   He Song possessed Array Tao talent, which was why he was able to enter Array Tao successfully after studying for three years and set up the Spirit-Gathering Array.   If he didn’t have Array Tao talent, he might have wasted decades and still not been able to set up even the simplest Spirit-Gathering Array.   Amulet Tao was different.   Even ordinary cultivators, after years of practice, could make spirit amulets skillfully, and the success rate wouldn’t be too low.   With some good luck, they could even earn a lot of spirit stones by doing so.    Under such circumstances, most cultivators who wanted to learn a craftsmanship chose to study spirit amulets.   This also led to a drastic drop in the price of spirit amulets.   As for Array Tao and other Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, they were seldom studied.   Apart from Amulet Tao, the rest of the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth either required spirit stones as nourishment, natural talent, or a long period of study. In the power-valuing Cultivation World, they were naturally not favored by most people.   Major forces would definitely have people studying various Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   But for loose cultivators, the opportunities and time to study these were scarce.   Nobody wanted to waste their cultivation time chasing an elusive opportunity.   Time was the ultimate killer of everything.   In the Cultivation World, cultivation was always the most important factor. On one hand, there was Amulet Tao, which anyone could learn, and it was a daily necessity. Once learned, one could quickly make a living from it.   On the other hand, there was Array Tao, which most likely required Array Tao talent. Failing to enter after wasting decades studying, and even slowing down the cultivation progress. For loose cultiva tors without time, resources, and power, the choice was obvious.   Even if they knew that, if they succeeded, their fate could be changed.   However, the long investment period, during which there would be no return on investment, but constant loss of time and cultivation, discouraged them.   Not that loose cultivators hadn’t tried.   But the vast majority of them failed during the lengthy investment phase.   As for those lucky few, who possessed Array Tao talent and successfully   learned the three basic Array Skills, and started to open their own spirit fields as loose cultivators.   As far as He Song knew, he had never met any of them, and he didn’t know what happened to them.   So, time flew by in the blink of an eye.   In this entire year, He Song didn’t hear any specific news about Evil Cultivators outside the Immortal Pavilion.   Even Wei Fan had not heard any news about the Evil Cultivators.   Every time they met at the beginning of the month, He Song would ask about it.   But Wei Fan just shook his head, indicating that he had not heard any news either.   Seeing this, He Song’s initial slight concern gradually turned into heaviness.   No news was the biggest news.   Perhaps… he should leave the Immortal Pavilion and hide in the mortal world for a while?   He Song thought about it, but quickly rejected the idea himself.   It wouldn’t work.    His wings were not yet strong, he had not even learned all the Qi Refining spells, nor had he bought a large number of spirit amulets for protection, and he had no artifacts to save his life.   If he left the Immortal Pavilion now, his safety would probably be even worse than staying in the Immortal Pavilion.   Instead of leaving the Immortal Pavilion at this moment.   It would be better to wait until his spirit rice matures, sell it a few times, enrich his spirit stone reserves, and greatly improve his combat power before making plans.   At least then, when traveling outside, he wouldn’t have to worry about losing his life to Evil Cultivators.   That’s what He Song thought at the time.   And that’s what he did.   Now, a year has passed, He Song opened his eyes, and a burst of spiritual pressure erupted from him.   “Sixth-tier Qi Refining! Good, good, good.”   Feeling the increased spirit power in his body, He Song’s face showed a fleeting expression of joy.   As early as a year ago, when He Song set up the Five Phases Array, he vaguely sensed that he would break through to the sixth-tier of Qi Refining within a year.   Unexpectedly, only now after a year had passed did He Song finally break through to the sixth-tier Qi Refining.   Although it was a bit later than he had expected.   But since he had broken through, it was a good thing. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m  A cultivation base at the sixth-tier Qi Refining could be considered a   middle-level in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   As long as he could break through the bottleneck and enter the seventh-tier Qi Refining, he could instantly join the upper ranks, on par with Wei Fan and other high-level members of the Immortal Pavilion.   Thinking that Wei Fan’s current cultivation base was only at the eighth-tier of Qi Refining, while his own had reached the sixth-tier Qi Refining, He Song’s eyes flashed with a hint of pride.   Choosing Array Skills from the Hundred Truths of Cultivation was indeed the right choice.   If it weren’t for the support of the Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song’s cultivation progress would definitely be slow.   Perhaps, by now, he would have barely broken through to the fifth-tier Qi   Refining.   However.   Although he had successfully broken through to the sixth-tier Qi Refining, the joy on He Song’s face didn’t last long.   Sixth-tier Qi Refining.   Next, he should consider how to break through the Qi-refining late stage.   If he encountered an insurmountable bottleneck during the breakthrough, what should he do then?   A thought flashed through He Song’s mind, and his eyes involuntarily looked at his storage bag.   Inside the storage bag, a hundred spirit stones shone brightly. Amulet pen, amulet ink, and amulet paper were neatly arranged inside.   “Fortunately, everything is ready. I just need the right opportunity. After becoming an amulet Tao master, even if the bottleneck is difficult, with the existence of the spirit field, at least I would have spirit stones to buy   Breakthrough Elixirs..”

Chapter 87: Chapter 86: The Spirit Rice Matures (2/5)   Translator: 549690339   With this, even if I cant break through the bottleneck relying on my own strength, I can still attempt to reach the Qi-refining late stage.   Recalling the content of the Amulet Tao Introduction in his mind, He Song let out a sigh of relief.   After a year of continuous comprehension.   He Song had fully grasped the Amulet Tao Introduction.   Low-quality Thick Earth Amulet, Mid-quality Thick Earth Amulet, High- quality Thick Earth Amulet.   Low-quality Golden Light Amulet, Mid-quality Golden Light Amulet,   High-quality Golden Light Amulet.   Low-quality Divine Movement Amulet, Mid -quality Divine Movement Amulet,   High-quality Divine Movement Amulet.   He Song had already understood all their production methods.   Regarding the engraving of amulet seals, He Song had rehearsed it thousands of times in his mind.bender   Next.   He just needed to spend spirit stones to purchase amulet paper and amulet ink, start making amulets, and constantly improve his success rate during the process of amulet making.   Once the success rate was high enough, He Song would naturally publicize his identity as an amulet Tao master.   By then.   It would be time for him to sell spirit rice for a huge amount of spirit stones!   Fortunately, a year ago, He Song had already bought an amulet pen, a stack of amulet paper, and a small bottle of amulet ink.   These things were enough to make ten spirit amulets.   Regardless of whether he was successful or not, He Song would need to continue purchasing amulet paper and amulet ink to draw spirit amulets.   But now was not the time to draw spirit amulets.   This time when leaving seclusion, He Song had other important matters at hand. Gattina   Opening the door.   He Songs figure swiftly headed towards the Stall Section.   Walking on the Immortal Pavilion Street, He Song kept glancing around, feeling inexplicably that there seemed to be more people in Immortal Pavilion.   However, after some thought, He Song knew that this wasnt an illusion.   Every year, there were quite a few first-tier Qi Refining cultivators coming from the mortal world.   After so many years, although there were fewer cultivators in Immortal Pavilion than before, it was still much better compared to when the Evil Cultivators wreaked havoc in the past.   Thinking about it carefully.   A trace of vicissitudes flashed in He Songs eyes.   It had been a full ten years since the year Master Cheng Shan went to the Red Spirit Gold Mine for support and Evil Cultivators attacked the Immortal Pavilion.            And He Song.   It had been a full fifteen years since he came to this world.   At the beginning when he had just crossed over, his previous self was only an eighteen-year-old first-tier Qi Refining cultivator.   But now.   He Song counted the days, he was actually already thirty-three years old.   Fifteen years.   He Song had walked carefully, step by step, growing from an eighteen-year-old first-tier Qi Refining cultivator to a thirty-three-year-old sixth-tier Qi Refining cultivator at present.   The hardships he faced during these times were known only to him.   He had experienced several life-and-death crises, but each time they were resolved by his caution and vigilance. However, the danger in this world was a reality.   If he was not careful enough, He Song might have died several times already.   In the future, he still needs to be vigilant at all times to ensure his own safety while continuing Cultivation.   Perhaps after countless years, when looking back, he would find himself unparalleled in the world.   Shaking his head, He Song cast these thoughts aside.   His steps continued without stopping towards the front.   This time, he came to the Stall Section to buy a cargo storage bag.   Storage bags were also classified by levels and functions.   Small storage bags, like the one He Song had, were the smallest in size and the cheapest, only needing a hundred spirit stones.   Large storage bags, with ten times the space of small storage bags, were much more expensive. A large storage bag required a thousand spirit stones.   Apart from these two kinds of storage bags, there was also a type of cargo storage bag.   What set cargo storage bags apart from regular ones was their size. Generally larger, cargo storage bags were not convenient to carry around.   Regular storage bags were only about the size of three fingers, making them easy to carry.   However, the smallest cargo storage bag was ten times larger than a regular storage bag.   The larger the cargo storage bag, the greater the space it contained.   The smallest cargo storage bag had a space ten times the size of a small storage bag.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates   Moreover, due to its inconvenience for carrying, the price of cargo storage bags was relatively low. The price of a small cargo storage bag was similar to that of a regular small storage bag, only requiring a hundred spirit stones.   A large cargo storage bag, on the other hand, required a thousand spirit stones.   He Song came here this time.   Naturally, he wanted to buy a small cargo storage bag.   The small storage bag on his body was too small, and it couldnt hold the ten thousand catties of spirit rice in his spirit field.   In order to harvest spirit rice, He Song had no choice but to save a years annual salary to come here and buy a small cargo storage bag.   Even though the small cargo storage bag was not easy to carry, he had no other choice.   The easily carried large storage bag, costing a full thousand spirit stones, was something He Song couldnt afford.            Arriving at the place specialized in selling storage bags, He Song spent a hundred spirit stones to buy a small cargo storage bag.   With the small cargo storage bag in hand, He Song had to exert some effort to stuff it into his sleeve.   It was indeed a bit large.   And it wasnt easy to carry.   Placing it in his sleeve, the soft bulge easily attracted attention.   However.   None of that mattered.   All he wanted was a place where he could store ten thousand catties of spirit rice and ensure its proper storage.   Once he became an amulet Tao master and the spirit stones on his body gradually increased, he would replace it.   Leaving the Stall Section.   He Song quickly returned home.   Immediately, he used the Earth Tunneling Skill and Breath Concealment Formulas, quickly tuning towards the spirit field he had opened up.   Several hours later.   He Song poked his head out from a dark corner of the spirit field valley.   With a flash of brilliance in his eyes, he scanned the surroundings. Only after making sure that there was no trace of any cultivator entering did He Song relax his vigilance and enter the valley.   However, even though he didnt find any trace of cultivators entering the valley, He Songs hand still held two Mid -quality Thick Earth Amulets.   Just in case of ambush.   Coming to the edge of his ten acres of spirit field.   He Song looked up, and his gaze was immediately filled with golden hues.   The golden spirit rice in the ten-acre field swayed gently in the breeze, the rice stalks bending under its weight, looking like they were about to fall down at any moment.   The spirit rice grains were plump, and strands of spirit Qi flowed in them, making people feel delighted at first glance.   Seeing this situation, a flash of joy crossed He Songs face.   Ten thousand catties of spirit rice!   A thousand spirit stones!   He got them!   Immediately, He Song took out thirty spirit stones.   Under his spell casting, the thirty spirit stones instantly turned into rays of light and fell into the six Array Skills operating here.   Four Spirit-Gathering Arrays, one Illusion Array, and one Five Phases Array.   These Array Skills required an annual consumption of thirty spirit stones, a fixed cost.   However.   The output of the spirit field here was a hundred catties of spirit rice per acre, worth a thousand spirit stones per year.   Such abundant output was rare in the world.   He Song didnt even know if he had accumulated a thousand spirit stones since he crossed over to this world, let alone by now.   Keep in mind, this was his total income since crossing over fifteen years ago..            

Chapter 88: Chapter 87: Method of Making Talisman (3/5)   Translator: 549690339   In the past, He Songs total income for fifteen years might not even have reached a thousand spirit stones.   However, now.   After establishing his own spirit field, He Songs annual income had suddenly skyrocketed to over a thousand spirit stones!bender   Such a terrifying return had left He Song a bit dazed at this moment.   It felt somewhat unreal.   Is this the reward of being self-reliant because of ones own craft?   Thinking back to his Qi Refining Early Stage, he worked himself to the bone for an annual income of thirty spirit stones.   And now.   He enjoyed his time at the Immortal Pavilion, didnt have to oversee his spirit field and yet could secure over a thousand spirit stones a year.   The contrast made He Song sigh lightly in his heart.   Indeed, in any world, working for others is a dead end.   Shaking his head, He Song quickly cast off these mixed thoughts, focusing instead on the ten acres of spirit field before him.   From his sleeve, he took out a small cargo storage bag.   He Song activated his Object Controlling Skills.   As his spirit power left his body, he also quickly used it to collect all the grains of spirit rice from the sprouts, storing them in the cargo storage bag.   As the Object Controlling Skills could only extend his spirit power out to about thirty feet, He Song had to repeatedly walk around in the spirit field to gather the spirit rice.   However, since he was a cultivator, both his walking speed and the speed of harvesting spirit rice were extremely fast.   So it didnt waste much time.   Soon.   An hour passed.   He Song de-hulled all the grains and stored the spirit rice into the cargo storage bag.   A total of over eleven thousand jin of spirit rice!   The spirit rice here grew well due to the strong spirit Qi, and naturally, the spirit rice that He Song harvested was more bountiful.   After leaving some spirit rice seeds to re-sow in the spirit field.   He Songs figure then appeared next to the small stream in the valley.   At this moment.   Being in possession of a cargo storage bag filled with over eleven thousand jin of spirit rice, joy was written all over his face, and it was hard to contain. In He Songs eyes, grains of plump spirit rice in the cargo storage bag had   tnrnpd int-n              hill                of enirit   Spirit rice is equivalent to spirit stones!   The over eleven thousand jin of spirit rice here.    Amounts to over a thousand one hundred spirit stones!   Add on the over one hundred spirit stones of his annual salary.   If he sold the spirit rice, his annual income would skyrocket to over one thousand two hundred spirit stones!   Over one thousand two hundred spirit stones!   If he calculated it based on his current annual salary at the Immortal Pavilion.   He would need a total of twelve years to save up this many spirit stones.   If it was during the Qi Refining Early Stage, when he was making thirty spirit stones a year, the time required to save up over one thousand two hundred spirit stones would be much longer.   He knelt down.   He Song scooped up some water from the stream and wiped his face, finally managing to suppress the heat in his heart.   The touch of the cold droplets quickly calmed him down.   It was his first time earning over a thousand spirit stones in a year.   Indeed, it made his heart surge.   He even felt like the whole world was beckoning him.   However, being naturally cautious, he quickly suppressed this feeling.   It was just a thousand spirit stones.   It just made him slightly wealthier than an average Qi-refining late stage cultivator, any Foundation Establishment Master probably has a higher income.   There was nothing to be proud of.   At least in the eyes of He Song, an everlasting being, this was indeed the case.   Better head back and start learning the Amulet Tao, once people know about my amulet Tao master identity, I can use the convenience of my position to sell the spirit rice in exchange for spirit stones. After calming down, He Song thought to himself.   Now.   The Array Skills had replenished the spirit stones, all the spirit rice had been harvested, and the spirit rice seeds had been sowed again.   All that was left was to wait until next year to harvest the spirit rice and replenish the spirit stones for the Array Skills.   There was no need to linger in this valley.   Once a year would suffice.   After one last look at the valley where his spirit field was, He Songs figure disappeared into the valley.   Several hours later.   He Song reappeared within the Immortal Pavilion, inside the house he was renting.   In the quiet room.   He Song poured out some of the spirit rice from the cargo storage bag for his daily meals, hiding the rest in less conspicuous places.   Only then did he let out a sigh of relief, pouring himself a pot of tea at the table.   Suddenly receiving over eleven thousand jin of spirit rice.   And the future promise of gaining more than eleven thousand jin of spirit rice annually.    With so much spirit rice, He Song naturally couldnt sell them all.   He would certainly need to keep some for his daily consumption.   Although mortal rice is cheap, for a cultivator, it just serves to fill the stomach every day.   AS ror spif1L rice.   If a cultivator consumes spirit rice daily, it can improve his cultivation speed, although not much, it is still significant.   This little improvement, for He Song, who always practices in the Gathering Spirit environment, is quite considerable.   He himself is a grower of spirit rice.   In the past, it was due to a lack of resources.   Now that he had the means, He Song naturally changed his daily meals to spirit rice immediately.   Thinking back to his Qi Refining Early Stage and the scenes of desperately saving spirit stones during the Qi-refining mid stage, a hint of helplessness appeared on He Songs face.   It couldnt be helped.   In the past, he was really short of spirit stones, so he wished he could split each spirit stone into two to spend.   Thats why he didnt develop the habit of eating spirit rice, and didnt regularly use spirit stones and elixirs for cultivation.   All these were to save spirit stones.   He wanted to make the best use of his spirit stones.   It can be said that, until now, He Song had always lived like an austere monk, letting go of worldly pleasures that even regular people would enjoy.   But now, things were different.   The cargo storage bag, filled with over eleven thousand jin of spirit rice, gave He Song enough confidence.   It was not until today.   Did He Song feel that he had truly left behind his mortal form from his previous life, becoming a real cultivator.   It looks like my days of poverty will soon be a thing of the past. He Song raised his tea cup towards the sky, toasting in solitude before drinking it down in one gulp.   Setting down the tea cup.   He Song waved his hand, and three things suddenly appeared before his eyes.   A low-grade Ghost Wolf Amulet Brush.   Low-grade amulet ink.   Low-grade amulet paper.   Opening the amulet ink, spreading out the amulet paper, He Song held the amulet pen in one hand, he silently recalled the method for drawing the low- grade Thick Earth Amulet.   After a while, when He Song felt that he had adjusted his state, he lifted his pen and dipped it in the ink.   As the amulet pen touched the paper, enigmatic amulet seals spread across the amulet paper.   Amulet seal is not a character.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m   But it is key for the spirit amulet to work.   Only by pouring the spirit power into the amulet pen, and drawing out the complete amulet seals in one stroke without any pauses, hesitation, or deviations, can a spirit amulet be fully drawn.   When spirit power from the body is poured into the amulet pen, and its used to draw a complete spirit amulet pattern on the amulet paper, the spirit amulet will truly take effect..

Chapter 89: Chapter 88: Amulet Tao Master He Song (4/5)   Translator: 549690339   At this moment.   He Song’s cultivation was at the sixth-tier Qi Refining level.   The spiritual power within his body was naturally much stronger than that of cultivators in the Qi-refining early stage.   Therefore, his control of the spirit power was not comparable to that of Qi-refining early-stage cultivators.   As a result, compared to those amulet Tao masters who started practicing amulet making from the Qi Refining Early Stage, He Song was able to learn the art more easily with his sixth-tier Qi Refining cultivation.   At the same time, since He Song had traveled across dimensions, his soul was inherently strong, and the control he exerted over his own spirit power during amulet making was even stronger than ordinary cultivators.   As such, He Songs first attempt at amulet making was successful!   As He Song’s brush smoothly traced the complete amulet seal pattern on the amulet paper, a flash of light emerged from the paper.   Immediately after that, He Song felt some of his spiritual power within his body being absorbed by the amulet paper before his eyes.   Once the amulet paper stopped absorbing his spiritual power, the paper in front of He Song had successfully turned into a lower-grade Thick Earth Amulet worth five spirit stones.   However, He Song did not care about the formation of this Thick Earth Amulet.   On the contrary, at that moment, He Song was standing still in front of his desk with various insights from his recent amulet drawing experience constantly emerging in his mind.   A thousand readings would reveal the essence.   Hadn’t He Song studied the Amulet Tao Introduction more than a thousand times?   Now that he had successfully drawn a spirit amulet on his first try, his happiness was accompanied by an immense amount of enlightenment gained from the process.   So, that’s how amulet making should be done.   That’s how the Thick Earth Amulet should be drawn.   The power of the Thick Earth Amulet is directly proportional to the amount of spiritual power absorbed at the end.   so…   After a long time.   He Song, who was immersed in his insights, finally came to his senses and cast his gaze upon the Thick Earth Amulet in front of him.   “From now on, I, Amulet Tao Master He Song!”   Picking up the Thick Earth Amulet on the table, a fleeting look of surprise flashed in He Song’s eyes.   His first attempt at amulet making had been successful.   Although it was due to a combination of various factors, for He Song, it was an excellent start.   It is worth mentioning that typically, Qi Refining Early Stage cultivators who can succeed in amulet making one out of ten tries are considered very talented.    But what about He Song?   Although he had studied the Amulet Tao Introduction for a year, that was just theoretical knowledge.   This was still his first practical attempt at amulet making.   The success of his first attempt would bring He Song great morale boost.   Perhaps from this day forward, the success of this amulet making attempt   would greatly enhance He Song’s confidence in amulet making.   With such confidence and a large supply of spirit stones, it would be difficult for He Song’s amulet-making skills not to advance rapidly.   He Song set aside the lower-grade Thick Earth Amulet in his hand, made some minor adjustments to his state, and quickly prepared for his second attempt at amulet making.   Although he already had a successful experience.   He Song still meticulously executed each step of the amulet-making process, conscientiously recalling his actions and the amount of spiritual power output during his first successful attempt.   A moment later.   He Song became focused, lifted his pen, and began drawing the second lower- grade Thick Earth Amulet.   However, despite fully investing himself in the drawing process, his pen tip’s spiritual power suddenly fluctuated just as the Thick Earth Amulet was about to be completed, resulting in failure. His second attempt at amulet making.   Failed! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎  Looking at the discarded amulet paper in front of him and the crystalline amulet ink on it, He Song shook his head slightly.   “It seems that I still need to fine-tune the flow of spiritual power in my pen tip.   My spirit power output must be stable, and I mustn’t be impatient.”   After some contemplation, He Song quickly figured out the cause of his failure and secretly resolved to correct this mistake.   Following this, He Song closed his eyes to rest once more.   Only after feeling that he had fully recovered to his optimal state did He Song open his eyes.   Placing a sheet of amulet paper in front of him.   He Song picked up the pen, dipped it in ink, and the pen tip danced gracefully across the paper.   At the window, the setting sun’s rays that were about to dip below the horizon streamed into the room, casting a golden glow upon He Song’s desk.   Even He Song’s figure was enveloped by the golden sunlight.   At this moment, He Song was completely focused with a lower-grade Ghost Wolf Amulet Brush in hand, drawing amulet seal patterns on the small amulet paper before him.   A short time after, He Song halted his arm movement and frowned at the amulet paper in front of him.   On the amulet paper.   The blood-like amulet ink had already solidified, and He Song’s pen tip remained at the lower part of the paper.    The spirit amulet was clearly unfinished.   However, He Song knew that both the amulet paper and the ink on it were now useless and could not be used anymore.   As for the reason.   He Song had figured it out.   When he was drawing the amulet seal, he had put slightly too much force into one stroke, causing the amulet seal’s pattern to change, and thus the spirit amulet could not be formed.   He put down the amulet pen and sighed softly.   “I thought I was an amulet-making genius, but it turns out that the first success was just a fluke. This second and third attempt truly reflect my real ability.”   Throwing the useless amulet paper aside, He Song picked up the now cold tea and drank it down in one gulp.   But then, he frowned, poured out the tea from the cup, picked up the teapot, and personally brewed a new pot of fine tea for himself.   Atterward,   He picked up the fragrant teapot and returned to his desk.   Failing in drawing spirit amulets twice, He Song needed to calm down and prevent recklessness.   He was naturally cautious and rarely acted recklessly.   However, it was better to be safe than sorry.   Seated by his desk and facing the gradually setting sun outside the window, He Song drank the tea in his cup, one after another.   At the same time, He Song started mentally reviewing the points he needed to pay attention to while drawing spirit amulets.   Spirit power output.   Tracing with the pen tip.   The seamless brush strokes.   And most importantly, a stable mindset.   Amulet making has never been simple; it requires a lot of time for error correction and practice.   Practicing amulet making actually consumes a significant amount of spirit stones. Generally, talented cultivators who have a good comprehension of amulet making and reach the Qi-refining mid-stage can maintain a balance between profit and loss in their amulet making skills.   As their cultivation level and amulet-making skills improve, they will gradually start profiting until they earn more and more.   As for the cultivators with average understanding and unwillingness to work hard,   This period would be extended, with the specific duration depending on their comprehension level, effort put forth, and fluctuating accordingly.   However,   If an ordinary cultivator truly devoted themselves to researching Amulet Tao, they would at least not waste decades like those in array Tao without any talent.   Studying Amulet Tao, as long as you work hard, you will always see rewards.   A short while later.   Feeling that he had returned to his optimal state, He Song put down his teacup and picked up his amulet pen once more.   Placing a sheet of amulet paper in front of him, He Song took a long breath, adjusted his state, and then lifted the pen to start drawing his fourth spirit amulet..

Chapter 90: Chapter 89: Success Rate (5/5)   Translator: 549690339   For a sixth-tier Qi Refining cultivator, creating a low-grade Thick Earth Amulet does not consume too much mental energy or spirit power.   However, if it’s a middle-grade Thick Earth Amulet, being able to create one a day would be quite impressive.   A middle-grade Thick Earth Amulet can withstand several attacks from a Qi-refining mid stage cultivator, and the spirit power contained within it is naturally quite terrifying.   Given He Song’s level of cultivation at the sixth -tier Qi Refining, his spirit power would be largely drained the moment he finishes an amulet. As such, he would need to recover his spirit power before continuing to create more.   So naturally, it does not require much spirit power.   He continued to draw.   He Song’s gaze was focused, his pen moved like a dragon or a snake, and the patterns of the amulet seal appeared one by one on the amulet paper.   Then, as the last stroke fell.   The amulet paper before him flickered with light briefly.   Immediately, He Song felt some of the spirit power in his body being absorbed by the amulet paper in front of him.   By the time the amulet paper ceased to consume spirit power, the amulet paper in front of He Song had successfully become a low-grade Thick Earth Amulet, worth five spirit stones.   Feeling the decrease of spirit power in his body, a flash of joy appeared on He Song’s face and quickly disappeared.   Fourth time of amulet making.   Success again!   “Two successes, two failures, a chance of fifty percent? No, it can’t be calculated like this, I’ve only drawn four times, I can only truly estimate the success rate when I draw a larger amount.”   Looking at the low-grade Thick Earth Amulet before him, He Song shook his head and cast aside the self-satisfying mood in his heart.   A low-grade Thick Earth Amulet, market price five spirit stones.   But the production materials, amulet ink and amulet paper, combined cost two spirit stones.   If the wear and tear of the amulet pen is taken into account, the cost will be slightly higher.   However, an amulet pen can be used for a long time and doesn’t often break.   Therefore, although the amulet pen is expensive, its actual cost is actually quite low.   It can be said that if an amulet Tao master’s success rate does not reach fifty percent, they might risk making a loss.   Even if they reach a success rate of fifty percent, for every two amulet creations, if at least one is certain to succeed, the profit would only be one spirit stone.   Each time an amulet is created, it consumes the cost of two spirit stones.   A single amulet can be sold for five spirit stones.    If it takes three attempts to succeed once, it would mean losing one spirit stone.   This kind of amulet price.   It is a market price brought about by the intense competition among amulet Tao masters.   There is no alternative.   The number of people who can create amulets is simply too high.   If the success rate can’t be raised to fifty percent, most amulet Tao masters won’t even have the chance to make a living from it.   He Song couldn’t believe that after pondering over the Amulet Tao Introduction for only a year and hand-making amulets himself, his success rate could be as high as fifty percent.   In general.   Normal cultivators learning amulet making usually spend at least two years studying the Amulet Tao Introduction.   One of the reasons He Song only spent a year was because his cultivation had reached the Qi-refining mid stage and he had already mastered the Array Tao Introduction. He had a head start.   Hence, he was much faster than ordinary cultivators.   During practice, the success rate is usually not very high.   If among ten amulet creations, two can succeed, that can already be considered a promising newbie in amulet making. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m  Most ordinary cultivators can only succeed once in ten amulet creations, or even not succeed at all.   And amulet making.   Also requires spirit stones.   Each amulet creation requires at least the cost of two spirit stones.   Once failure happens, it is a total loss.   Of course, one can continue to study the Amulet Tao Introduction to increase the success rate.   When there are plenty of spirit stones later on, one can then use spirit stones to buy amulet paper and amulet ink to start making amulets.   This is why most cultivators only gradually master the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth after reaching the Qi-refining mid stage.   There is no other way.   They are simply too poor during the Qi Refining Early Stage.   Only when one’s cultivation reaches the Qi-refining mid stage and income increases, can they have the financial capability to learn amulet making.   Earlier, when Meng Guan wrote to He Song, saying that not mastering a particular skill in the Qi-refining mid stage was a late regret, it was because of this.   In the following time.   He Song used up all the six remaining amulet making materials.   However, in the end, out of ten materials for making amulets, only three were successful.    He ended up with three low-grade Thick Earth Amulets.   This result gave He Song a secret delight.   It seemed that by studying Array Skills in advance, as well as having excellent soul attributes, he was more suited to amulet making than ordinary cultivators.   On his first attempt at making amulets, the success rate was already over thirty percent.   With that rate, if he continues to ponder the Amulet Tao Introduction and practices slowly, he might soon be able to increase his success rate for making amulets to over fifty percent.   When that time comes.   It’s time to advertise his identity as an amulet Tao master.   Once everyone knows his status as an amulet Tao master.   He Song’s gaze turned towards the quiet room.   Within the quiet room, in that small cargo storage bag, there were still more than eleven thousand kilograms of spirit rice.   When the time comes, using the convenience of his position to sell all this spirit rice will lead to an income of over eleven hundred spirit stones. With this, he would no longer have to worry about lack of spirit stones in the future.   He put away the three low-grade Thick Earth Amulets on the table. After some thought, He Song decided to wait a while longer.   He would wait until his success rate really reached fifty percent.   Then start taking action.   In the following time, He Song’s life became peaceful again.   During the day, he took care of the Medicine Garden, using the rich spirit Qi of the Medicine Garden for cultivation. His cultivation level gradually increased, slowlv advancing towards the seventh-tier Oi Refining.   At night, he would return home and continue to study the Amulet Tao Introduction.   From time to time, he would bring out the amulet pen without dipping into the amulet ink, drawing on the table, trying to recall the feeling of making amulets.   However.   Due to the shortage of spirit stones, He Song simply didn’t have any spirit stones left for daily practice of making amulets.   Therefore, he could only wait for another year, until he received his annual salary, before making amulets again.   Before that, He Song decided to familiarize himself with the process of making amulets using a pen that had not been dipped in amulet ink, so that he would become more familiar with amulet making.   As for actually making amulets.   He would wait till he got his annual salary, then use it to buy materials and start drawing amulets.   At present, his identity as an amulet Tao master hadn’t been made known, and   He Song himself didn’t know what his current amulet making success rate was.   Under circumstances where he couldn’t explain the source of his spirit stones, He Song decided to wait another year.   After all, there was plenty of space in the small cargo storage bag. Subsequent harvests of spirit rice can also fit in, and he needn’t worry about it spoiling inside.   Rather than taking risks for the sake of some time.   It’s better to move forward according to his own plan.   That way, his safety can be ensured, and there would be no loss of the spirit rice grown..

Chapter 91: Chapter 90: 1 Year   Translator: 549690339   Its just some time being wasted.   However.   As an everlasting being.   To He Song, anything that could be solved with time was not a problem at all.   In this way.   Another year quietly passed by.   During this year, He Songs life was still relatively peaceful.   Although the battle between the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team and the Evil Cultivators outside the Immortal Pavilion was becoming more and more intense, it did not affect He Songs life.   Its just that, six months ago, Meng Guan sent a message to He Song, saying that he had joined the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team.   He Song discussed with Wei Fan, and in the end, they did not interfere.   Joining the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team now is risky, but with Meng Guans Qi-refining late stage cultivation, he should be safe if he is cautious.   At the same time, Meng Guan joined the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, if there is any movement from the Evil Cultivators, He Song and Wei Fan can get the firsthand news.   As a result, the security of the two of them in the Immortal Pavilion would naturally be greatly increased.   Moreover, the penents of the Immortal City Law Entorcement leam are good, and the more resources gained, the better it is for Meng Guan.   Both emotionally and logically, the two had no reason to interfere.   They just sent a sound-transmitting paper crane at the beginning of each month to confirm Meng Guans life and death status.   Besides that.   In this years time, He Songs understanding of the Amulet Tao Introduction has also achieved a breakthrough.   Thick Earth Amulet, Divine Movement Amulet, and Golden Light Amulet, these three spirit amulets, He Song has studied for a long time, and he is already familiar with the drawing methods of these spirit amulets.   And when the annual salary is issued.   After using all of the one hundred and more spirit stones of this years annual salary to purchase low-grade amulet materials.   After continuous research, He Songs success rate of drawing low-grade Thick Earth Amulets has finally reached over 50%.   so.   He Song doesnt need to worry about not having enough spirit stones when drawing spirit amulets.   With the success rate of drawing low-grade Thick Earth Amulets reaching over 50%, he can rely on this to earn spirit stones.   As long as He Song continues to draw, the spirit stones on his body will naturally become more and more.   Until He Song begins to try drawing other spirit amulets, and the increase will decrease or even disappear.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎   Amulet Tao Masters.            When drawing new spirit amulets, they also need a period of time to become familiar with the process.   For the amulet Tao master, its normal to lose money during this initial process of getting familiar with drawing a new amulet.   Only when the success rate of the newly learned spirit amulet reaches over 50% can the amulet Tao masters revenue increase again.   With spirit stones to earn, they can naturally buy more materials to practice.   Like this, back and forth.   He Song will soon learn the drawing of low-grade Thick Earth Amulets, low-grade Golden Light Amulets, and low-grade Divine Movement Amulets and increase the success rate of these three spirit amulets to over 50%.   So, after mastering the drawing methods of these three low-grade spirit amulets, He Song will immediately start promoting his identity as an amulet Tao master.   By that time.   It will be the real moment when He Songs wealth starts to skyrocket.   However.   Now that a year has passed quickly, He Song has only increased the success rate of drawing low-grade Thick Earth Amulets to 50%.   As for the low-grade Golden Light Amulet and low-grade Divine Movement Amulet, He Song has also tried but with a low success rate.   For this, after some hesitation, He Song focused on making low-grade Thick Earth Amulets.   As long as his chance of making low-grade Thick Earth Amulets is high, he can earn more spirit stones.   After earning more spirit stones, he can buy more materials to practice low-grade Golden Light Amulets and low-grade Divine Movement Amulets.   Only with an abundance of spirit stones and a continuous supply of materials can he quickly increase his success rate in making amulets. The saying practice makes perfect is about this principle.   One day.   He casually picked up the small cargo storage bag that he had hidden for a year, and his figure disappeared.   Today is the day to go to the spirit field to harvest the spirit rice and replenish the spirit stones for the array.   Using the Earth Tunneling Skill and Breath Concealment Formulas, He Song quickly disappeared underground and headed towards the spirit field he had opened up.   A few hours later.   After passing through several mortal cities, He Song finally arrived at the location of his spirit field.   The valley was beautiful and picturesque.   The ten acres of spirit rice shone with a golden glow. He Songs head appeared from a dark corner and swept around.   The valley was very quiet, with no anomalies.   Using the Spirit Vision Skill, he also did not find any movements from other cultivators.   After sensing that there was no danger, He Song appeared in the valley with two middle-grade Thick Earth Amulets in his hand.   First of all.   Replenish the spirit stones of the array in the valley.   Next, its time to harvest the spirit rice.            Since He Song had already experienced harvesting the spirit rice once, this time it only took him half an hour to finish harvesting all ten acres of spirit rice and planting new spirit rice seeds.   After finishing all this, He Song looked at the satisfactory extra 11,000 catties of spirit rice in the small cargo storage bag.   Considering last years and this years harvests.   He now has more than 22,000 catties of spirit rice in his possession.   If he sold them, the 22,000 catties of spirit rice would be worth more than 2,200 spirit stones at the market price.   With so many spirit stones, even if he practiced all the way to the Qi-refining late stage, he would definitely never lack resources.   Returning to the Immortal Pavilion.   After a little thought, He Song did not continue practicing but took out some low-grade Thick Earth Amulets he had previously drawn and headed for the Stall Section.   Stall Section.   It plays a significant role in the Immortal Pavilion.   Whether its loose cultivators or Immortal Pavilion cultivators, when they come to the Immortal Pavilion, they must visit the Stall Section.bender   The Immortal Pavilion is set up for the convenience of nearby cultivators to trade.   And the Stall Section is where the nearby cultivators do their trading.   There is a large flow of people here.   The speed of information dissemination is fast.   Plus, they can buy some rare and interesting items.   When He Song first arrived more than a decade ago, he also learned about the existence of the Stall Section.   Naturally, when he wanted to promote his identity as an amulet Tao master, the Stall Section became the first choice.   As an amulet Tao master.   Its reasonable to sell the Thick Earth Amulets in the Stall Section, right?   He only needs to set up a stall when he doesnt need to be on duty at the Medicine Garden, and his identity as an amulet Tao master will soon be widely known.   In this wav. with this source of income. He Songs spirit stones can slowly be   laundered.   At the same time.   Apart from setting up a stall in the Stall Section to sell amulets.   He Song will also use the connections he has made in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion over the past decade or so to promote his amulet Tao master identity.   Once thats done.   It wont take long.   He Song guarantees that in just one month, the news of him becoming an amulet Tao master will spread throughout the entire Immortal Pavilion.   And by that time.   As the manager of the Medicine Garden, he can use his position to sell some spirit rice, and the spirit stones he gets will naturally not attract attention anymore..            

Chapter 92: Chapter 91: The Huge Pit   Translator: 549690339   As the manager of the Medicine Garden,   He secretly sold spirit rice.   As long as he was careful and discreet, he was certain that it wouldn’t attract too much attention.   However,   just when He Song was taking advantage of his free time to sell amulets in the Stall Section and promote his identity as an amulet Tao master, the arrival of a sound -transmitting paper crane suddenly brought his plans to a halt.   On this day,   He Song was preparing to go out and sell amulets as usual, and by the way, promote his identity as an amulet master in order to prepare for selling spirit rice in the future.   But just as he was about to go out, a sound-transmitting paper crane descended from the sky and instantly landed in front of He Song.   Seeing this, He Song reached out to grab it, revealing a hint of spirit power.   Suddenly, the originally glowing paper crane turned into a piece of paper and fell into He Song’s hand.   “Mr. He, it’s been several years since we met. Ping’er has now followed her master to Green Wall Immortal City, and couldn’t bid farewell to you before leaving. I hope you don’t mind.’ Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates  “The reason for this message, is that I remembered that you once bought an Array Tao Introduction at the Spirit Skill Pavilion. I don’t know if you’ve started yet.”   “Ping’er recently heard from her master that if one starts learning array tao, they can be directly accepted into the Thick Earth Sect as an inner disciple.”   “If you have such an opportunity, Mr. He, I would like to congratulate you in advance.”   “Ping’ er. ”   Looking at the graceful handwriting on the paper, He Song’s face remained unchanged, but his heart was already filled with turbulence.   No wonder.   No wonder he had never heard about the fate of loose cultivators who had entered the array tao before.   No wonder he had never seen even one Arrav Path Master.   No wonder when he searched for a location to open a spirit field, he had never seen any place occupied by other Array Tao cultivators.   No wonder…   Clutching the paper in his hand, He Song returned to his room and shut the door, only then revealing a trace of struggle on his face.   According to Ping’er’s letter, if he reported truthfully that he had entered Array Tao, he could be accepted into the Golden Elixir Great Sect, the Thick Earth Sect as an inner disciple.   Thick Earth Sect, Golden Elixir Great Faction.    Ordinary Qi Refining cultivators were all outer disciples.   Only when one had a high probability of successfully challenging the   Foundation Establishment Realm would they be called an inner disciple.   Once they broke through to Foundation Establishment, they would no longer be disciples but Elders!   Although the power of elders differed, their status was the same.   That is to say,   Once one entered array tao, they had a higher probability of entering the Foundation Establishment Realm in the eyes of the Thick Earth Sect.   Therefore, they threw out such enticing conditions, inviting those who had entered Array Tao to join the Thick Earth Sect in advance, cultivating their sense of belonging to the sect.   Sitting by the desk,   He Song leisurely brewed himself a pot of tea.   Only when the room was filled with the pleasant fragrance of tea did he finally calm his mind.   Originally,   He Song had never thought that one day he would be able to join the Thick Earth Sect as an inner disciple during the Qi Refining stage.   But now… looking at the paper in his hand, He Song felt that this opportunity seemed to come suddenly.   However, being naturally cautious, although he had already learned the news, after calming down, he still decided to probe a little further.   “Thank you for your concern, Ping’er. Even though I’ve studied Array Tao for several years, I haven’t achieved anything. Helplessly, I’ve turned to studying Amulet Tao now.”   “After a few years of study, I have now become a well-known amulet master in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.”   “It seems that I am not destined for such opportunities, but I still want to thank Friend Ping’er for telling me everything.”   “Furthermore, I have studied the array tao for several years and still haven’t made an entry. I hope that Friend Ping’er can help clarify my doubts. Why is it so difficult to enter the array tao?”   “Yet, once entered, one can be directly taken in as an inner disciple by the   Thick Earth Sect.”   “He Song.”   A thin sheet of paper appeared in He Song’s hand. The spirit power in his fingertips moved, quickly imprinting lines of words on the paper.   With a puff of spirit power, the paper in his hand flew up towards the sky and toward the distance.   In the room.   Next to the desk.   At this moment, He Song no longer had the mood to continue selling amulets in the Stall Section.    He had already entered the array tao and even harvested two rounds of spirit rice.   More than two thousand kilograms of spirit rice were stored in his small cargo storage bag, waiting for the completion of his plans before being sold.   Although he coveted the status of being an inner disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, he had not yet lost his composure due to the fact that he would soon earn thousands of spirit stones a year.   Anyway.   Whether or not he joined the Thick Earth Sect.   He could live well on his own.   Even if the Immortal Pavilion was no longer safe, he could leave the Immortal Pavilion and live in other safe places.   As long as he had enough spirit stones, he could live a good life wherever he went.   A short while later.   While He Song was patiently waiting for Ping’er’s reply, a sound-transmitting paper crane descended from the sky and landed in front of He Song.   Seeing this scene, He Song’s eyes brightened. He immediately released his own Qi, grabbing the sound-transmitting paper crane in an instant.   The paper crane transformed into a sheet of paper, which He Song spread out casually.   “Congratulations to Mr. He for becoming an amulet Tao master. Although the amulet Tao is not as favored as the array tao, it is still a good way to make a living. Ping’er wishes to congratulate Mr. He.”   “As for your doubts, I have also heard from Master about the difficulty of entering the array tao. To enter the array tao, one needs a natural talent for it. Without talent, ordinary cultivators can study for decades and still not enter.”   “If one has the talent for the array tao, they can generally enter within five years, learning the first Gathering Spirit Array. After another five years, they can learn the other two major array skills.”   “Once one enters the array tao, they can become an inner disciple of the Thick Earth Sect. This is indeed true, and after entering the array tao, it’s impossible to hide it.”   “Do you know why the three arrays in the Array Tao Introduction are the Gathering Spirit, Elusive Trace, and Five Elements Arrays, instead of other arrays?”   “According to what my master said casually, when combined, the Gathering Spirit, Elusive Trace, and Five Elements Arrays can be used to open a spirit field in the outside world, planting spirit rice or other spirit plants.”   “However, the production of these three major array skills is actually deliberate. The output of spirit rice and spirit plants in the Immortal Pavilion and Immortal City is limited.”   “If a certain Immortal Pavilion or Immortal City suddenly has an unexplained source of spirit rice… Mr. He should understand what I mean.”   “Ping’ er. ”   As He Song’s gaze swept over the delicate handwriting on the paper, his face darkened slightly.   Gathering Spirit, Elusive Trace, Five Elements?   Weren’t these the arrays recorded in the Array Tao Introduction?   The Gathering Spirit Array provides spirit Qi for the spirit field, the Elusive Trace Array conceals the aura and the spirit field, and the Five Elements Array protects the spirit field from invasion.   He could think of the fact that the combination of these three arrays could open a spirit field in the outside world, yielding huge profits.   So… how could the Thick Earth Sect and other cultivators of this world not think of that?   Based on Ping’er’s description, these three array skills were obviously a trap.   A big trap!   Moreover, it was a trap that had been dug long ago, just waiting for the cultivators to fall into it!

Chapter 93: Chapter 92: Terrifying upon Reflection   Translator: 549690339   Although this huge pit was not lethal at all.   After jumping in, it seemed like there was a broad road waiting for you.   But   When He Song thought about everything he had done, all under the calculations of the cultivators in this world, he felt a deep sense of malice.   Its terrifying!   No wonder its the Cultivation World.   As long as there are benefits, the minds of these cultivators are truly agile, arranging all sorts of pits for you.   Faced with this situation, He Song instantly felt a sense of familiarity.   Didnt this scene resemble the corporate slaves of his past life, whose lives were arranged by others?   During the first twenty years, they were responsible for spending the money of their parents generation.   For the next thirty years, they were responsible for repaying their debts.   And in the last twenty years, they were responsible for donating money to hospitals.   Isnt this life clearly arranged?   The huge pit He Song faced now had also been arranged by others a long time ago.   Once they entered Array Tao, even those with Array Tao talent would not know that they just had to go to the Thick Earth Sect to become an inner disciple.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates   Just like He Song, he had no idea about this before.   It wasnt until Pinger suddenly remembered him and informed him of everything that he found out.   But that was no problem; as long as he opened his own spirit field and started selling spirit rice, he would soon be found by the Thick Earth Sect.   Under the rule of the Thick Earth Sect.   The spirit rice and spirit plants produced by the Immortal City and the Immortal Pavilion every year are all accounted for.   If there was more or less, it would attract attention.   Following the trail, they would have a high probability of finding that person.   In this way, even people like He Song who didnt know about this would soon be accepted by the Thick Earth Sect.   It can be said that the Thick Earth Sect had calculated everything.   As long as you entered Array Tao, it would be impossible for the Thick Earth Sect to ignore you.   As long as you showed abnormalities, the Thick Earth Sect would naturally investigate you.   As long as you showed value, the Thick Earth Sect would naturally accept you into their ranks.   Want to establish your own sect?            According to He Songs guess, it probably wouldnt be possible.   How could the Thick Earth Sect, which governed the territory, give you the chance to establish your own power?   At the same time.   Upon seeing what Pinger had written in her letter that ordinary Array Tao talented cultivators usually took about five years to enter He Song suddenly realized something.   He not only had Array Tao talent but learned faster than ordinary Array Tao talented cultivators.   Perhaps it was because his soul was stronger.   He Song thought to himself.   But soon after, He Song fell into deep thought again.   It was already clear from Pingers letter.   In the Thick Earth Sects area of influence, if He Song wanted to sell spirit rice and earn spirit stones, he was bound to be discovered by the Thick Earth Sect.   By that time, once the matter was traced back to He Song, he would probably become an inner disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, no longer able to stay in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion as he currently did.   Although becoming an inner disciple of the Thick Earth Sect wasnt bad at all on the contrary, there were plenty of benefits He Song still needed to think it over.   Should he become an inner disciple of the Thick Earth Sect?   Orcontinue staying in the Immortal Pavilion?   For a while, He Song began to weigh the pros and cons.   The benefits were clear.   By joining the Thick Earth Sect, he would become an inner disciple with the backing of a powerful sect.   Unlike his current position as a loose cultivator, living in fear every day, he would have peace of mind.bender   Moreover, because he had Array Tao talent, he wouldnt need to fight and would primarily focus on arranging arrays. Thus, combat had little to do with He Song.   He would be able to practice peacefully, stepping into the Foundation Establishment Realm as soon as possible, and become a high-ranking Master.   There were drawbacks as well.   After joining the Thick Earth Sect, if there was any hardship in the sect, he would have to contribute.   Furthermore, He Song didnt know if he would still have as many spirit stones coming his way once he joined the Thick Earth Sect after entering Array Tao.   He was an everlasting being, and if he stayed in the Thick Earth Sect for too long, his endless lifespan might attract unnecessary troubles. Being in the sect, he also wouldnt have the freedom he had now.   His thoughts were racing.   He Song thought for a long time but was still unable to make a decision.   However.   While weighing the pros and cons, He Song still sent a sound-transmitting paper crane to thank Pinger, who was far away in Green Wall Immortal City.   If it werent for Pingers message today, He Song might not have known that he was on the verge of stepping into a huge pit.   The three Array Skills in Array Tao Introduction were the huge pit He Song mentioned.   Although this pit wasnt fatal.            He Song thought that if he could avoid his fate being out of his control, he should try to avoid it as much as possible.   At the same time.   After realizing that the Array Tao Introduction was a huge pit, He Song began to hesitate slightly about whether or not to sell spirit rice.   If he decided not to join the Thick Earth Sect.   Although he was the manager of the Medicine Garden and could secretly sell spirit rice with his identity, He Song couldnt guarantee that doing so wouldnt attract the attention of the Thick Earth Sect.   Although there was no loss in being exposed, this uncertainty made He Song frown.   In the end.   Should he join the Thick Earth Sect or not?   If other cultivators saw He Songs dilemma, waves of shock would surely arise.   In the Immortal City and Immortal Pavilion under the rule of the Thick Earth Sect.   Almost all cultivators dreamed of joining the Thick Earth Sect.   Even if they just became outer disciples of the Thick Earth Sect, it would be a meteoric rise in status for them.   If they knew that He Song was now contemplating whether or not to join the Thick Earth Sect and become an inner disciple of the sect   They would probably swarm him and rip him to shreds.   What others couldnt even dream of had landed on He Songs head.   And yet   At this moment, he hesitated.   After a long period of contemplation.   He Song sighed, feeling that his thoughts were in turmoil.   He immediately stopped thinking and began meditating and practicing.   Days passed one by one.   It had been several days since He Song had learned of the opportunity to join the Thick Earth Sect and become an inner disciple after mastering Array Tao.   During these days, He Song did not do the usual practicing and studying Amulet Tao, selling amulets at the Stall Section, or guarding the Medicine Garden.   Instead, he began to wander around aimlessly.   He walked around the Immortal Pavilion, looking at the various ancient buildings around him and sighing in his heart.   This difficult choice was indeed taking a toll on him.   Joining the Thick Earth Sect seemed to have potential risks in the future. His immortality and endless lifespan would be hard not to notice if he stayed in the sect for an extended period.   Unless he could break through to Golden Elixir within a reasonable age and be on par with the ancestors of the Thick Earth Sect.   Otherwise   But choosing not to join the Thick Earth Sect, what would he do about his spirit rice? What about the resources for his future cultivation?   In the small cargo storage bag, there were still more than 22,000 catties of spirit rice after all.   If he wanted to establish his foundation, he would need to obtain a Foundation Establishment Elixir, right? Where would he get it without resources?            

Chapter 94: Chapter 93 Song   Translator: 549690339   As such.   He Song moved forward, constantly wandering in the Immortal Pavilion, though his mind was in turmoil.   He didnt know how long hed walked.   Suddenly, a fragrant scent brushed against his nose.   Song? A crisp female voice suddenly sounded from beside He Song, carrying a hint of surprise-   Upon hearing it, He Song followed the voice.   He saw a delicate-looking young girl standing beside him, her eyes looking tentatively at him.   When He Song turned his head, the girls eyes brightened once she saw his face clearly, and a flicker of joy crossed her face.   So, it really is Song. I was worried I had mistaken you for someone else. Do you still remember me?   The crisp feminine voice that echoed in his ear gave He Song a sense of familiarity.   Before he could think further, the figure of a little girl suddenly appeared in his mind.   This voice   Su Yan? (From Chapter 25)   How did the little girl, who used to pester him for a sugar-coated hawthorn, suddenly become such a delicate young woman with radiant, smart eyes?   Moreover, looking at her cultivation level, it seems she has successfully drawn Qi into her body, reaching the first-tier of Qi Refining.   He Song instantly remembered Su Yans identity.   Twelve years ago, when He Song had just broken through to the third-tier of Qi Refining, his neighbors were not only his good friend Lin Cong but also another family.   This family consisted of an old man and a child.   The old man was named Su Jin, whose cultivation level had already achieved sixth-tier of Qi Refining.   The little girl was named Su Yan, who had not yet begun her Cultivation.   According to Su Jins words at that time, Su Yan was his own granddaughter from the mortal world.   Because she was born with a Spirit Root, he brought her from the mortal world and taught her himself.   If He Songs memory served him right, these two had only been his neighbors for more than two years.   Su Yan indeed used to pester He Song quite frequently.   But Su Jin, due to his cultivation level, didnt interact much with He Song at that time.   Later on, the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion suffered an attack from Evil Cultivators, and many cultivators died as a result.   Twelve years passed in the blink of an eye.   He Song believed that the old man and the little girl had died in the catastrophe years ago, but to his surprise, he ran into an old acquaintance in the Immortal Pavilion today, twelve years later.   Of course I remember you. I just didnt expect that twelve years would flash by in a blink, and little Yan would have grown up so much.   Looking at the delicate girl in front of him, He Song was suddenly struck with a feeling of time having passed him by.   When a familiar face grows up suddenly.   When those of a similar age to him grow old suddenly.   When the world changes while only he remains unchanged.    He Song didnt know how to feel about his emotions at this moment.   All he felt was a sense of displacement, as if he had been transported to another world.   Twelve years had passed, and the little girl who used to pester him for a sugar-coated hawthorn was now all grown up.   And he hadnt changed at all.   This disparity made his heart tighten, and he broke out in a cold sweat.   He was an everlasting being.   In the eyes of others, he was a complete anomaly.   If his identity as an everlasting being were to be discovered, his fate would undoubtedly be horrific.   In light of this.   He absolutely cant stand out too much.   Otherwise, if hes constantly under observation, every action he makes will be magnified by others.   If his secret is discovered.   Given the abilities of the Cultivation Worlds elites.   Extraction of ones soul, refined into spirit, cut into thousands of pieces, having the skin peeled and the sinews pulled out these would be childs play.   When his soul is imprisoned and he is forced to endure eternal suffering, then he would truly want to live but cannot, and want to die but cannot.   He didnt want his life to be controlled by others.   At the same time, he couldnt tell anyone this secret.   This was the Cultivation World, where the Soul Searching Skill existed.   If by any chanceViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels   Just thinking about the consequences made He Song break out in a cold sweat.   What on earth had he been thinking before!   This path cannot be taken.   Naturally.   Mediocrity, unnoticed and stable development, just quietly cultivating immortality.   That is what He Song should be doing at this moment.   Only by appearing unremarkable, can he avoid attracting attention.   Only by avoiding attention, can he better conceal himself.   Only by concealing himself, can he prevent his secrets from being discovered.   Only by keeping his secrets undiscovered, can he manage to live a better life.   Only by living a better life, can he gradually become stronger, eventually ensuring that nobody dares to covet his secrets.   So what was he thinking before?   With the talent for array tao, to join the Thick Earth Sect as an inner disciple?   There are very few people with array tao talent, and fewer still who would choose array tao from the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   Such a person, just one, would be sufficient for the Thick Earth Sect to take as an inner disciple.   Naturally, such an existence has nothing to do with being average.    If he joined the Thick Earth Sect in such a manner, he feared he would end up under the spotlight.   By then, just stepping out of the door would probably invite the gaze of spectators.   Every move he made would be under scrutiny.   This is not the life He Song wants, nor is it the life he could lead.   Living under the spotlight, his disguise will inevitably be revealed one day.   Thus.   Upon suddenly grasping this point, He Song immediately dismissed the idea of going to the Thick Earth Sect to become an inner disciple.   Too risky!   In the off chance that someone discovered his secret, he feared not only death but something even more terrifying having his soul extracted to endure eternal torment.   In order to avoid such suffering, He Song secretly made up his mind.   Even if he had to join the Thick Earth Sect in the future, he would never join as a genius.   Otherwise, He Song would rather be a loose cultivator than risk imprisonment by joining a sect.bender   How could a naturally cautious person like him take such a risk?   With this in mind.   He Song finally breathed a sigh of relief.   His gaze softened slightly when he looked at Su Yan in front of him.   If Su Yan hadnt appeared.   He might still be caught in a dilemma.   But Su Yans appearance solved one of his biggest problems at the moment.   Naturally, He Song found Su Yan, whom he hadnt seen for a long time, more pleasing to the eye.   Of course, its been twelve years. I was only eight years old then, but now Im twenty. Im not a little girl anymore; Im an adult now.   Su Yans eyes curved like crescent moons, even boasting a hint of pride on her face.   It was as if growing from a little girl to a young woman in twelve years was something to be proud of.   By the way, Song, did you still live in the Second District these twelve years? Twelve years ago, my grandfather suddenly took me to the First District, and since then I havent seen you again.   Overjoyed at their reunion, Su Yan kept asking He Song questions.   However, upon hearing Su Yans words, a look of understanding crossed He Songs eyes.   It turns out that the old man and the little girl didnt die twelve years ago.   And they even moved from the Second District to the First District.   The houses in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion are divided into four districts based on the letters A, B, C, and D.   Each of these areas is distinguished by street names and house numbers.   For instance, He Song resided in No. 13 House, Cloud Piercing Street, the Second District in the outer periphery of the Immortal Pavilion.   The four districts are located on the four sides of the Immortal Pavilion, and the spirit Qi in each district is almost the same, so there is no case where the First District is more distinguished than the Second District.   As for why the old man and the little girl moved, He Song did not ask.   But.   Instead of letting Su Yan chat with him on the street, He Song thought that it was more comfortable to go into a teahouse, sit down, and chat over tea. Therefore, He Song quickly led Su Yan into the closest teahouse.   On the second floor of the teahouse.   After casually ordering a pot of good tea, He Song led Su Yan to a seat near the window, starting to chat while accompanied by the aroma of the tea, asking about each others current conditions..

Chapter 95: Chapter 94: The Old Friend Has Passed Away   Translator: 549690339   As Su Yan began to speak.   He Song gained some understanding of why the elderly man and the young girl moved their home and what happened after they settled here.   Twelve years ago.   Evil Cultivators attacked the Immortal Pavilion, causing heavy losses to the Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team, and the outskirts of the Immortal Pavilion were completely abandoned.   But, since Su Jin’s cultivation level had already reached the sixth- tier Qi Refining back then, and he made a living by demon beast hunting, his combat power was formidable.   Therefore, when the Immortal Pavilion descended into chaos, Su Jin took Su Yan and escaped.   For someone like Su Jin, with high cultivation and strong power, it was relatively easy for him to protect Su Yan and survive.   Ordinary evil cultivators could not do anything to him.   It was not until Master Cheng Shan returned and apprehended all the evil cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion.   Su Jin then moved to the First District with Su Yan and remained low-key ever since.   He Song hadn’t seen the old man and young girl since then.   Not until today.   Unknowingly, He Song strolled through the Immortal Pavilion and came to the First District by coincidence, where he met old acquaintances from twelve years ago.   After hearing Su Yan’s account.   He Song’s expression remained unchanged, but he had some doubts about this story in his heart.   You see.   rlwvelve years ago, Su Jin was already a sixth-tier Qi Refining cultivator, and being a loose cultivator, he had a wealth of combat experience.   When the Immortal Pavilion suddenly plunged into chaos, Su Jin chose to leave with Su Yan instead of taking advantage of the situation, which was not something a loose cultivator would usually do.   Under such circumstances, the vast majority of loose cultivators would typically take advantage of the chaos.   He Song believed that those loose cultivators whose fortunes suddenly improved after the great catastrophe were likely to have done exactly that.   Moreover, if you do not suddenly become wealthy, why would you move your home?   He Song thought little of Su Yan’s story, but he did not question anything and simply nodded with a smile.   At the same time, a trace of reminiscence appeared in his eyes.   “Alas, I was taken away by a friend back then and narrowly escaped the catastrophe. Now that I think of it, it was truly horrifying.”   Su Yan nodded continuously as she listened to He Song’s words.   However, she soon began to inquire about He Song’s past.    He Song naturally picked the tales he could share and told her about some of the things he experienced during those twelve years.   As for what he couldn’t tell her. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels  He definitely wouldn’t reveal that information.   He Song had this in mind, for he hadn’t seen Su Yan for years and didn’t know what her character was like now.   If her appearance did not alleviate He Song’s worries, he might not have even paid her any attention.   “What? Brother Song has already reached the sixth-tier of Qi Refining!” However, even if He Song carefully shared only certain things with Su Yan, she gasped in astonishment when she learned that He Song’s cultivation had reached the sixth-tier of Qi Refining.   Seeing this, He Song hurriedly made a hushing gesture, which made Su Yan lower her voice.   “Sixth-tier Qi Refining, even at his peak, my grandfather’s cultivation was only at the same level. It’s only been a dozen years, and Brother Song has already caught up with him.”   Su Yan’s voice softened, and a shadow of sadness flashed through her eyes.   However, the words she uttered left He Song somewhat surprised.   That Su Jin, whose cultivation reached the sixth-tier of Qi Refining, fought fiercely, and made a living by hunting demonic beasts.   He was dead?   Upon hearing this.   He Song opened his mouth, wanting to say something.   But as the words reached the tip of his tongue, he didn’t know how to express his thoughts.   He couldn’t help but think back to twelve years ago.   His own cultivation level was third-tier Qi Refining, while Su Jin’s was at the sixth-tier Qi Refining.   He had never experienced a battle, while Su Jin, being a loose cultivator, made his living by hunting demonic beasts and had rich combat experience. At that time, even though Su Jin was always friendly towards He Song, he felt the innate distance between them.   When Su Yan would often come to pester him, Su Jin didn’t stop her but didn’t encourage it either.   Back then, the two of them were like ordinary neighbors, maintaining superficial politeness.   If it weren’t for Su Yan often seeking him out, He Song might not have had any impression of this older man and his granddaughter.   But…   When Su Yan personally announced the news of Su Jin’s death.   Thinking back to the old man who used to stand behind Su Yan with a faint smile on his face, He Song still felt a trace of desolation.   A mortal’s life lasts but a few decades, and one who can live up to seventy would be considered extremely fortunate.   It should be known that the lives of mortals here are like those in ancient times, with a difficult to describe average lifespan.   The saying “life rarely lasts past seventy” is a portrayal of a mortal’s life.   The life of a Qi Refining stage cultivator, even if cultivated to the perfection of the Qi-refining late stage, can only live up to 120 years.    The early-stage Qi Refining cultivators can live until ninety, and the mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators can live to one hundred years.   The difference in lifespan between Qi Refining cultivators and mortals is not large.   Only when reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, with a lifespan of two hundred years, can one truly be considered separate from the mortal world, having more than three times the life of mortals.   With the addition of Longevity Elixirs, the lifespan would be even higher.   As for higher levels…   He Song had no idea about the number of years the Golden Elixir Stage and Nascent Soul Stage cultivators could live.   On the miscellaneous books of the Spirit Skill Pavilion in the Immortal   Pavilion, there were no clear records, only knowing that it should be very long.   Now…   He Song had just crossed over not even a decade ago, and someone by his side was already buried in the yellow earth.   Although he didn’t know how many years Su Jin had lived, death was still death. A person’s death is like a snuffed out lamp, never to return.   Such a scene couldn’t help but make He Song sigh in his heart.   “Please don’t be too sad. You don’t need to belittle yourself. In the future, you will surely be able to cultivate to the sixth-tier Qi Refining, and even higher, with the hope of Foundation Establishment.”   While he sighed in his heart, He Song still comforted Su Yan.   Although they had only been neighbors for more than two years, little Su Yan had always liked to pester him, which could be considered a beautiful memory.   For old acquaintances, He Song didn’t hesitate to speak.   However…   Though he could say those words of comfort.   It was unlikely that he could provide any help at this moment.   She was just a little girl who used to pester him. They haven’t seen each other for more than a decade, and He Song didn’t know what Su Yan was like now.   If he observed her for a period of time and found her character to be decent, it wouldn’t be impossible for them to become good friends and for him to help her.   But not right now.   He Song didn’t believe that Su Yan was living that badly now.   Before Su Jin’s death, he was still a sixth-tier Qi Refining cultivator after all, so it was impossible for him not to leave behind some inheritance for Su Yan.   With that in mind, her life should be bearable.   After being comforted by He Song, Su Yan’s mood quickly improved.   However, compared to before, an unnoticeable sadness lingered.   And so, very soon…   After their casual conversation…   They exchanged the Qi signature of the Sound Transmission Skill and the location of each other’s residence, intending to keep in touch in the future, and then each went their separate ways.   Su Yan left the tea house and disappeared to who knows where.   He Song, on the other hand, followed the path he remembered from earlier and headed back home..

Chapter 96: Chapter 95: Immortal Master, Spare My Life   Translator: 549690339   In the room.   By the desk.   He Song held his breath and concentrated, easily drawing a lower-ranked Thick Earth Amulet.   Afterwards, he took a long breath, sat down, cleared his mind, and began to contemplate his future path.   When he first met Su Yan, He Song had already made up his mind that he would not use his gift in array tao to join the Thick Earth Sect.   That would make him too conspicuous.   If someone were to uncover his secret, he feared he would be immediately imprisoned and tortured for the secret to longevity.   But he didn’t possess any secret to longevity.   Moreover, He Song did not want his life and death to be controlled by others.   Being outside, before having the strength to resist, being a relaxed loose cultivator was the best plan.   At least, outside, he didn’t need to worry about the Golden Elixir Master or Ancestor Yuanying discovering his secret.   Since that was the case. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates  The handling of the over twenty thousand jin of spirit rice in his small cargo storage bag became the issue He Song needed to consider at this moment.   Furthermore, since he chose not to go to the Thick Earth Sect, the resources he would need for his future cultivation would have to be created by his own hands.   These two matters needed to be addressed simultaneously, and he needed to keep the Thick Earth Sect in the dark.   He Song was thinking, and an idea quickly emerged in his mind.   “I wonder if in the world of mortals, there is a martial arts cultivation skill that can change one’s body shape and appearance… If there is, combined with the Breath Concealment Formulas, it might be worth a try.”   If he could really change his body shape and appearance, and then use the Breath Concealment Formulas to hide his aura, and put on a black robe.   He Song felt that as long as he was careful, moving within the earth undetected by other cultivators on usual days.   Even if he sold spirit rice in the Immortal Pavilion or Immortal City under the jurisdiction of the Thick Earth Sect, he shouldn’t attract too much attention.   Even if he did attract attention, they might not be able to trace it to him.   Using his position as a Medicine Garden manager to secretly sell spirit rice was a plan that He Song rejected early on.   If he really sold spirit rice, He Song would surely be grandly accepted into the Thick Earth Sect and become an inner disciple.   At that time, He Song’s plan would be completely disrupted.   Having been in the Immortal Pavilion for more than a decade.   He Song had seen many people who didn’t like to show themselves.    These people, usually all in black robes, use the Breath Concealment Formulas to hide their aura while walking and trading in the Immortal Pavilion.   This way, their identities would be hidden.   In the Cultivation World.   There was no shortage of cautious cultivators.   These people, clad all in black with no trace of aura, were indeed numerous in the Cultivation World.   However, to be extra cautious, He Song wanted to change his body shape and appearance as well before proceeding in this way.   In this case.   After selling spirit rice, the Thick Earth Sect would surely get wind of it.   But as long as he hid well enough, the Thick Earth Sect might not be able to trace it to him.   With the thought, came action.   He Song quickly Earth Tunnelled out of the Immortal Pavilion and ended up in the quiet room.   Li Dynasty.   Salt City.   He Song Earth Tunnelled here, once here, after observing in secret for a moment, soon grabbed a burly man who looked very fierce, capable in martial arts and had a wicked glint in his eyes.   This man, when He Song just arrived, was in middle of a violent crime.   Moreover, he was killing a commoner, and before He Song could step in to stop him, he found the commoner was already dead.   Naturally, He Song had no sympathy for him, and took the opportunity to seize him and drag him to a dark corner unseen by others.   When He Song pointed at the burly man, a beam of spirit power pierced through the man’s right palm on the spot.   Amid the brawny man’s piggish-like screams, He Song spoke in a hushed tone. “I’m going to ask, and you will answer. Slow to reply: you die. Answer wrongly:   you die. Hesitate: you also die. Understand?”   In the corner, the brawny man who felt like he had been turned upside down and inside out, was now completely terrified.   The ability he just used to traverse under the ground must be an Immortal Master’s method!   Why was he so unlucky to be targeted by an Immortal Master?   Being born in Li Dynasty, he was well aware of the existence of Immortal Masters. Even within the tiny Salt City, there were several people that were rumored to have become Immortal Masters.   Thanks to the Li Dynasty’s extensive promotion and clarification, he had a clear understanding of Immortal Masters.   As he faced an Immortal Master standing before him, who effortlessly pierced his palm and was ready to interrogate him, his fear was understandably compounded.   “Mercy, Immortal Master! Mercy! I clearly heard you! Please ask your question, Immortal Master.”   Seeing that the brawny man was completely freaked out, He Song did not torture him further, but immediately started to press on his inquiry.    “Do you know of any martial ability in the world that can alter one’s physique and appearance?”   The reason why He Song resorted to the mortal world in search of such ability was quite straightforward.   Regardless of the skill, any that were executed by a cultivator would be covered with spirit power.   But if it’s martial ability was used, there would be no spirit power coverage, making it a much better weapon for deceiving other cultivators.   That is why He Song is here.   Who would have guessed that someone would go to such lengths to conceal their appearance, even learning martial arts from the mortal world, despite being a cultivator?   For most cultivators, if they wished to alter their appearance, they usually learned a skill or two to do so.   “Yes, yes, yes, there is such a martial ability!” Facing He Song’s question, the brawny man nodded repeatedly, fearing he would be killed if he answered too slowly.   “Where?” He Song’s eyes lit up.   He thought he would have to gather more information before finding what he wanted.   Unexpectedly, the first person he interrogated knew of the existence of such martial ability.   “I don’t have the exact location, but I’ve heard that there’s a rapist active in the vicinity of Salt City who, according to the government’s announcements, possesses the ability to change his physique and appearance.”   Hoping for mercy, the burly man hurriedly revealed to He Song all that he knew.   “What’s his name, any distinguishing features, where is he now?”   He Song continued his questioning.   Now that he had a target, it was necessary to have some understanding of that target. With that knowledge, he could find him faster.   “That… I don’t know. But he should still be around Salt City. He’s never left as far as I’m aware.” Upon finishing, the burly man looked desirous of life in He Song’s direction.   However, after hearing his words, He Song’s eyebrows furrowed.   “You answered too slow.”   As soft uttered words rang out, He Song casually pointed out.   Suddenly, a scorching fireball appeared out of thin air, landing directly on the muscular man. The terrifying heat quickly reduced him to ashes. The man didn’t even let out a scream before turning into a pile of ashes.   “Killing for the first time by my hands isn’t as bad as I thought. This Fireball   Skill is really useful for disposing of bodies. Brother Wei really didn’t lie to me.”   After cleaning up the evidence, He Song nodded in satisfaction.   From now on, there were no traces left of He Song and the burly man’s presence.   He had never actually intended to let the guy live.   Being a martial artist himself, He Song could see the cruel glint in the man’s eyes. Killing, after all, is commonplace in the Martial World.   However, besides the cruelty in his eyes, he had also killed innocent civilians in front of He Song. The burly man had probably killed countless of these innocents.   When left in the hands of He Song,   It could also be considered as a form of divine justice.   Besides, this man knew that He Song was investigating martial abilities that can change appearance and shape. If something were to happen, he might immediately bite back at He Song..

Chapter 97: Chapter 96: Tendon Changing and Bone Grinding   Translator: 549690339   In that case, there was no way to keep this person.   However, the information he obtained from this person’s mouth made He Song fixate on the rapist.   “The rapist?”   At the bulletin board of Salt City, He Song’s gaze quickly found the notice about the rapist among others.   In the notice, it clearly warned the residents of Salt City to be vigilant against the rapist lurking around, and publicly disclosed the martial arts skills the rapist had to change appearance and physique.   Obviously, the authorities in Salt City were on guard against the appearance of the rapist.   Leaving the bulletin board.   A glint of spiritual light flashed in He Song’s eyes as he swiftly scanned the crowd before him.   Although the rapist’s martial skills to change appearance and physique were exquisite, He Song believed that if the other party was not a cultivator, they would not be particularly on guard against the Spirit Vision Skill.   Therefore.   The rapist might only have changed their superficial appearance, rather than their overall appearance and physique.   If the appearance and physique hadn’t changed completely, that meant He Song could use the Spirit Vision Skill to observe the inconsistencies within the rapist’s body.   In this way, all he needed to do was use Spirit Vision Skill to investigate and uncover the clues.   Of course, if the rapist maintained a perfect change in appearance and physique at all times, even He Song’s Spirit Vision Skill wouldn’t be able to see through it.   A seemingly normal appearance, only slightly altered to make it look like they’d changed into another person, but with no inconsistencies lurking within.   This was the martial skill to change appearance and physique that He Song wanted to find.   But how could a mortal martial artist who was not a cultivator guard against the Spirit Vision Skill?   So how could they maintain a flawless shift in appearance and physique at all times?   And that was why He Song chose to use the Spirit Vision Skill.   For unprepared mortal martial artists, the existence of cultivators was still somewhat ethereal.   Although the Li Dynasty propagated their existence, true encounters with cultivators were rare among ordinary people, usually occurring only at the pinnacle of mortal society.   Swiftly scanning the surroundings.   A trace of disappointment flickered in He Song’s eyes.   There were no irregularities in the appearances and physiques of the people around.   If he was not here,            Then let’s search slowly.   Anyway, he had the Spirit Vision Skill, as long as he could encounter the rapist, he could easily recognize them.   He Song activated his Spirit Vision Skill and quickly scanned Salt City.   One street.   Two streets.   Three streets.   One grand residence.   Two grand residences.   Three…   One after another, the streets were scanned by He Song.   One after another, the mansions were visited by He Song.   As a cultivator, He Song walked extremely fast, and with just a glance, he could judge dozens or even hundreds of people.   With such a rapid search method, there was no way the mortal constables could keep up.   As a result, several hours later, He Song finally found his target in the backyard of a grand residence.   This mansion was large and remarkably exquisite.   Carved beams and painted rafters, flying eaves and gables, pavilions and pagodas, artificial mountains and flowing water, it had everything.   One or two deep corridors connected various parts of the mansion, and from time to time, maids could be seen walking through the corridors, heading in all directions.   In contrast, He Song’s target, who had been searching for hours, had transformed into a servant girl and was closely following a young lady. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎  Standing atop the corridor’s roof tiles, He Song’s gaze swept over the person, the spiritual light in his eyes flickering as he felt a speechless surge within his heart.   The infamous rapist.   Naturally, his gender was male.   But the other party had disguised themselves as a servant girl, and he had realized something was amiss when he scanned them with his Spirit Vision Skill.   They were in Salt City, inside a grand residence, and had become a maidservant for a rich young lady.   With so many factors put together, the identity of the person before him naturally came to light.   The rapist!   “This is not easv to hide. It seems that if I learn this martial skill in the future, I can only use it to change my appearance, not like him.”   Shaking his head, He Song made his way down from the corridor’s roof immediately after identifying the person’s identity and instantly activated the Earth Tunneling Skill, tunneling into the ground.            Once underground, He Song found an unguarded moment and dragged the rapist he had found into the ground, just as he had done when he captured the strong man earlier.   Immediately, he took the rapist through the underground, quickly arriving at a dark corner.   He threw the rapist into the corner and casually prodded him four times.   Four beams of spiritual light instantly pierced through both of the rapist’s wrists and ankles, crippling him in an instant.   Ignoring his screams of pain,   He Song reached out and fished a small bundle from his clothes.   Earlier, when the Spirit Vision Skill swept over, He Song had found that the rapist had no cultivation within him, so naturally he didn’t waste words with him.   Instead, he simply captured him, crippled his hands and feet, and began searching his body.   Opening the small bundle,   He Song quickly found two books inside. “Bones and Muscles Easing Skills”   “Thick Earth Formulas”   Glancing at the titles of the two books, He Song couldn’t help but look down at the still screaming rapist, a flash of surprise crossing his eyes.   He Song had never heard of the Bones and Muscles Easing Skills before, but it should be the martial art that allowed the rapist to change their appearance and physique.   But as for the Thick Earth Formulas… Where they already that commonplace?   Just by catching a random rapist, he could find a copy of the Thick Earth Formulas on them?   “If you don’t want to die, stop screaming.”   Watching the still screaming rapist, He Song frowned and chided softly.   The rapist’s screaming came to an abrupt halt.   “Where did you get these two secret books?” He Song waved the two books in his hand and asked.   How could a mortal rapist have the Thick Earth Formulas?   His former-self, even after becoming a cultivator, had bought the Thick Earth Formulas at the Immortal Pavilion for a spirit stone.   “Reporting to the Immortal Master, this humble one found these two books in a cave, not knowing if they’re real or fake. I have tried to cultivate them, but to no avail, so I have no choice but to carry them on my person and study them all the time in hopes of gaining some insights.”   Sensing the murderous intent in He Song’s eyes, the rapist handed over all he knew.   He was similar to the strong man, having heard of the existence of Immortal Masters.   He Song had brought him from underground to here with such means, which naturally made him understand just who He Song was.   Now, his life and death were in someone else’s hands, so he would answer whatever He Song asked.   However, despite not knowing why He Song was capturing him, his gaze was still spinning around, seemingly searching for an opportunity to escape.   Listening to the rapist’s voice, He Song frowned.   Because the rapist had disguised himself as a maid, his voice sounded female, even when he had screamed out earlier, he did not switch back to a male voice.   This made He Song feel a little uncomfortable listening to it.   “If you can’t speak normally, I can cut off your tongue so you can learn properly..”</        

Chapter 98: Chapter 97: Departure   Translator: 549690339   Under He Song’s verbal threats and the stimulation of the murderous intent in his eyes.   The rapist who had been pretending to be a servant girl instantly felt a chill in his heart, realizing that He Song had seen through his disguise.   However.   No matter how he thought about it, he couldn’t understand.   Why would an Immortal Master be eyeing someone like him, a mere rapist?   Could the Immortal Master be interested in learning his skills in sexual assault?   With countless thoughts racing through his mind, he dared not defy He Song. “Yes, yes, I’ll speak normally, please calm down, Immortal Master.”   As his voice changed back to a male one, his body transformed with a series of crisp bone-shifting sounds. In a short time, he went from a petite servant girl to a burly man.   Although there was no beard on his face, He Song could hardly equate the big man’s figure with the petite servant girl he had just seen.   The size difference was too great, and if it weren’t for the difficulty in hiding certain features when changing from male to female, He Song might not have seen through him.   Seeing this, a glint of interest flashed in He Song’s eyes.   The martial arts skills of the rapist seemed quite unique, not something common or mundane.   “Recite the technique you’ve learned to change your appearance.”   Seeing that the other party was so obedient, He Song casually made a wiping gesture, and a thin piece of paper appeared in front of him.   At the same time, spirit power flowed from his fingers, ready to record the words on the paper.   Although He Song had already found the secret manual of the “Bones and Muscles Easing Skills” from the rapist, he still needed to verify its authenticity by comparing it with what the rapist recited.   Soon, under He Song’s questioning, the rapist recited the entire “Bones and Muscles Easing Skills” manual.   He Song jotted it down, compared it with the manual, and after finding no discrepancies, he chopped off one of the rapist’s hands.   Ignoring the miserable screams that followed.   He Song ordered him to recite the manual again.   In this way.   After reciting it three times.   The rapist was reduced to a mere cripple.   He Song then asked him about the location of the cave where he had obtained the “Bones and Muscles Easing Skills” and the “Thick Earth Formulas.” After obtaining a location.   He Song nodded in satisfaction, using the Fireball Skill to turn the rapist into ashes.            He collected the ashes into his storage bag, cleaned up the traces around him,   Ince   leu.   This man.   Was a rapist.   In He Song’s view, once he discovered his identity, the man was as good as dead.   Moreover, he couldn’t let him die too easily.   In this ancient-like mortal world, the existence of rapists could bring about the ruin of countless households and lives.   Having no psychological pressure in killing such people, He Song didn’t think twice about it.   Furthermore.   After obtaining the “Bones and Muscles Easing Skills” from him, He Song also needed to keep it a secret.   Who could keep a secret forever?   The answer was, of course, obvious.   Only the dead could keep secrets forever.   After obtaining the “Bones and Muscles Easing Skills,” He Song did not go to the location mentioned by the rapist to seek opportunities. Instead, he hurried back to the Immortal Pavilion without stopping.   Although He Song looked down upon mortal martial artists in Salt City, killing two evil people in one day, he knew his own limits as a cultivator.   While facing mortal martial artists, he could handle them with ease.   However, if he encountered Evil Cultivators, with his current level of cultivation, he could only pray that they hadn’t learned the Earthshaking Skill and use the Earth Tunneling Skill to escape for his life.   Therefore.   As soon as he achieved his goal.   Leaving the mortal world and returning to the safety of the Immortal Pavilion was his top priority.   A few days later. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎  He Song stood in the quiet chamber, activating the Bones and Muscles Easing Skills, manipulating his muscles and bones with the secret technique.   Soon, He Song’s originally handsome face underwent a drastic change.   At the same time, his height shrunk by almost half a head.   Aside from having sixth-tier Qi Refining level spirit power, He Song had completely become a different person.   Standing in front of the bronze mirror, he looked up.            A simple and honest-looking teenager appeared in the mirror.   The teenager wasn’t tall, but his muscles were quite firm. His honest face paired with his physique gave people the impression that he had little experience in the world.   Then, He Song once again activated the Bones and Muscles Easing Skills, manipulating his muscles and bones with the secret technique. Immediately, He Song’s originally honest face changed again.   Suddenly.   A handsome young master appeared in the bronze mirror.   Though he wasn’t wearing white clothes and holding a white folding fan, his elegant demeanor was enough to catch anyone’s attention.   “Not bad, not bad. With this secret technique and the Breath Concealment Formulas, no one, not even those who are familiar with me, will be able to recognize me.”   After trying out several different appearances in front of the mirror, He Song returned to his originally handsome appearance, his eyes filled with satisfaction and his heart secretly delighted.   Now.   Even if he suddenly had a large number of spirit stones in his possession, it would not arouse suspicion from others.   Moreover, as an amulet Tao master, his combat strength was powerful, and he wouldn’t attract unnecessary covetousness.   In this way.   After learning the secret technique that could change his appearance, He   Song’s top priority was to change his appearance and start stealing spirit rice.   Although he had already increased his success rate of crafting the low-grade Thick Earth Amulet to over 50%, the spirit stones he possessed were no longer in short supply.   But who would complain about having too many spirit stones?   Upon receiving his annual salary the previous year and purchasing a large amount of amulet-making materials with those hundred-plus spirit stones, He Song had managed to raise the success rate of crafting low-grade Thick Earth Amulets to over 50%.   As for the low-grade Golden Light Amulets and Divine Movement Amulets, the success rates were not high.   To quickly increase the success rates of the low-grade Golden Light and Divine Movement Amulets to over 50%, a large amount of spirit stones were needed.   Although ordinary amulet Tao masters would use one type of amulet with a high success rate to earn spirit stones and then use those spirit stones to continuously improve the success rates of the other two types of amulets to rapidly improve their amulet-making skills.   In doing so, they could become a true amulet Tao master.   A true amulet Tao master’s success rate with each of the three types of low-grade spirit amulets must be over 50%.   As for He Song.   Since he had already cultivated massive amounts of spirit rice and could steal it without anyone knowing, it made sense for him to steal spirit rice, quickly acquire large amounts of spirit stones, and use them to strengthen his skills and increase his amulet-making success rate.   This was the optimal solution for He Song.   By doing so, he could quickly achieve enormous progress!   He Song put his plan into action, activating the Bones and Muscles Easing Skills and manipulating his muscles and bones with the secret technique.   Soon.   A slightly taller and indifferent-looking young man appeared in the bronze mirror in front of He Song.   He looked to the left and right, then used the Spirit Vision Skill to inspect himself again. After ensuring that there were no flaws, He Song nodded in satisfaction..        

Chapter 99: Chapter 98: Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion   Translator: 549690339   Activating the Breath Concealment Formulas again.   He Song’s breath instantly disappeared without a trace.   If it weren’t for the bronze mirror in front of him and his figure still visible in the quiet room, He Song might have thought he had disappeared.   The Breath Concealment Formulas can hide one’s breath, making it impossible for others to detect their breath and cultivation base.   Like this.   He Song only needs to put on a black robe to perfectly hide his identity.   Although the black robe doesn’t have the function of preventing divine sense detection, when He Song encounters other Qi Refining cultivators, he doesn’t have to worry about them having divine sense.   If he runs into a Foundation Establishment Master, even if their divine sense sweeps over him, his face won’t be his original one.   Naturally, the security is still very high.   Even if the Thick Earth Sect knows that within their sphere of influence, a Formation Tao cultivator has appeared, they cannot trace He Song.   With a different body shape and no trace of his breath, there is naturally no way to search.   Having this in mind.   He Song casually took out a black robe from his storage bag and quickly put it on.   This black robe was something he had bought early on in the Stall Section, many cultivators would have some prepared.   He Song bought more than a dozen of them, planning to burn each one after wearing it once, definitely not giving anyone else the opportunity to track him down.   Put on the black robe. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎  Hide the breath.   After changing his appearance and body shape.   A thin piece of paper soon appeared in He Song’s hand.   As the spirit power poured out, lines of text quickly appeared on the thin paper.   “Wei, I’m in a critical stage of practicing amulet making, so I’m entrusting you to help me. Please check the Medicine Garden twice a day.”   “Once I finish my practice, I’ll definitely invite Wei to Osmanthus Pavilion.”   “He Song.”   With a spit of spirit power from his hand, the thin paper instantly transformed into a sound-transmitting paper crane and soared into the sky, flying to the distance.   For this trip, he didn’t know how long he would be gone, so he couldn’t give up his position as the Medicine Garden administrator just yet.   So, he could only ask Wei Fan to fulfill his duties temporarily.    After all, Wei Fan has already helped him once, so this time should be familiar ground and with fewer mistakes.   After completing all this and having no more worries.   He Song casually picked up the small cargo storage bag next to him and put it into his black robe. In an instant, his entire body tunneled into the ground and headed east.   This time.   With full preparation, He Song did not plan to sell spirit rice in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   That would be too easy to trace.   Instead, he decided to tunnel to Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion, another immortal pavilion a thousand miles to the east of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion.   As the name implies.   Most of the income of the immortal pavilion comes from the spirit rabbits raised in the pavilion.   It’s like most of the income at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion comes from the vast expanse of Golden Bamboo planted inside.   The growing cycle of Golden Bamboo is a bit long, and He Song never thought about planting it.   Instead, the Grey Spirit Rabbit in the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion.   It is considered a precious ingredient.   The reason for choosing this immortal pavilion also has its reasons.   When He Song first traversed to this place and flipped through the surrounding map in the Spirit Skill Pavilion, he found a record of the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion.   The Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion is the most popular immortal pavilion among the surrounding cultivators, aside from Green Wall Immortal City.   It’s not for any other reason.   Only because in the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion, the price of spirit rabbits is much cheaper than in other immortal pavilions.   In the records, the spicy rabbit head in the Osmanthus Pavilion located in the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion is most popular among cultivators. Basically, those who have been there will taste it.   Perhaps it is due to their love of good food.   Perhaps Grey Spirit Rabbits in the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion are too cheap.   Or perhaps fluffy rabbits can also evoke cultivators’ fondness.   The Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion is quite famous in the surrounding area.   It is the immortal pavilion with the most cultivators around, except for Green Wall Immortal City.   Because of this, the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion is full of mixed fish and dragons, and all kinds of cultivators walk through it. The public order is more chaotic than Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   However, despite that.   He Song still chose the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion as the place to sell his spirit rice.    The reason is that there are enough cultivators in the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion. Selling more than 20,000 catties of spirit rice in one go will not attract attention too quickly.   If it really attracts attention afterward, he will probably already be tunneling away.   With Earth Tunneling Skill and Breath Concealment Formulas.   He Song can leave the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion quickly without being detected by other cultivators.   In this way, He Song’s safety would naturally increase significantly.   It takes nearly one day and one night for He Song to tunnel the thousand miles from Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion at his current speed.   Fortunately, before leaving the immortal pavilion, He Song had already asked Wei Fan to take care of the Medicine Garden.   So there was no need to worry about the garden being unattended.   However.   For the first time in performing such a long-distance tunneling, He Song’s initial curiosity quickly turned to indifference.   Tunneling across a thousand miles with his Earth Tunneling Skill, He Song could stick his head out to take a look at his surroundings and enjoy the landscape of this world at intervals.   But as time passed, the number of times He Song peeked out decreased.   Until eventually, he only stuck his head out when necessary and didn’t surface, always tunneling underground.   No matter how beautiful the scenery is.   It becomes dull after a while.   One day later.   He Song followed his memory of the location of the Spirit Rabbit Immortal   Mansion and easily tunneled to a hidden corner a few miles away from the mansion.   Compared to Bamboo Mountain Immortal Mansion, the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion is considerably larger.   Additionally, the cultivators walking around here are more numerous than those at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   After all, aside from Green Wall Immortal City, it is the immortal pavilion with the most cultivators in the area. He Song left the hidden corner and headed towards the inner part of the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion.   Looking around, seeing cultivators coming and going, it was even busier than Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   There was no fee for cultivators to enter the immortal pavilion; only when they entered the Immortal City would they be symbolically charged an entrance fee of a spirit stone.   He Song calmly stepped into the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion, glancing at a token standing at the entrance to the Immortal Pavilion.   That was a map of the Immortal Pavilion.   A map would be available at the entrance of every immortal pavilion, with different areas marked on it.   For example, He Song wanted to go to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, so it was marked on the map.   Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Apart from selling spirit medicine, they naturally collect popular items like spirit rice.   He Song was already familiar with the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion from his time at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Instead of going to the Stall Section to haggle with loose cultivators selling spirit rice.   It’s better to take the spirit rice directly to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion to sell it. Although the profit will be less, it won’t catch anyone’s attention and lead to fatal danger..

Chapter 100: Chapter 99: 2000 Spirit Stones   Translator: 549690339   The market price of spirit rice was one spirit stone per ten catties of rice.   Of course, selling to the loose cultivators in the Stall Section would naturally have a lower price than the market rate.   He Song had inquired about this when he was at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   He would have to give a 5% discount.   That is to say, if He Song were to sell ten thousand catties of spirit rice, the original market price would be one thousand spirit stones.   However, if sold to loose cultivators with a 5% discount, he would only get nine hundred and fifty spirit stones. The other fifty stones would be the loose cultivators’ profit.   It couldn’t be helped. If one wanted to quickly dispose of spirit rice and have others expend time selling it, then they’d have to offer a discount.   This would save a lot of time.   Simultaneously, getting the spirit stones quickly and leaving would reduce the chances of being targeted while setting up a stall.   Of course, if one sold a large quantity of spirit rice under the watchful eyes of the stall section, they would likely be targeted immediately.   Once they left the Immortal Pavilion. there would lind011htedlv be people   tailing them.   This was what He Song did not want to see.   Therefore, the idea of going to the stall section and trading with loose cultivators was rejected by He Song early on.   If He Song sold the spirit rice directly to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, although the price would be even lower than what the loose cultivators offered, he wouldn’t have to worry about being targeted.   Besides, selling spirit rice at the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion relieved He Song of the worry that anyone other than the pavilion would target him.   Transactions at the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion were one-on-one, so He Song wouldn’t have to worry about his personal safety.   As a department subordinate to the Thick Earth Sect…   The Spiritual Medicine Pavilions of the various Immortal Pavilions still had some credibility.   Not to mention that He Song only wanted to sell around twenty-two thousand catties of spirit rice, but even for more valuable spirit medicines, loose cultivators would generally choose to handle them at the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   The prices offered by the pavilion for precious spirit medicines were not too low.   There was a reason for this.   If the pavilion offered very low prices for valuable spirit medicines, the vast majority of loose cultivators would choose private transactions instead of selling to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   As a department devoted to buying and selling spirit medicines under the jurisdiction of the Thick Earth Sect, the pavilion naturally couldn’t just sit by and watch this happen.   Only by establishing a good reputation and providing a sufficiently safe environment would loose cultivators be willing to sell their precious spirit medicines to the pavilion without any concerns.   Instead of obstinately holding onto them and letting them spoil with time.    Purchasing precious spirit medicines within their jurisdiction to supply the disciples of the Thick Earth Sect was the duty of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, as well as one of the reasons for its existence.   As for the spirit rice…   The market price was one spirit stone for every ten catties of rice.   Selling to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion required a 10% discount.   That is to say…   By selling ten thousand catties of spirit rice to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, He Song would receive nine hundred spirit stones.   This price was slightly lower than what the loose cultivators in the stall section offered.   However, the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion was much safer compared to the outside world.   Naturally, the best choice for He Song, in the interest of safety, was to directly visit the local Spiritual Medicine Pavilion to sell his spirit rice.   As for whether the source of this spirit rice would be investigated afterwards…   That was no longer He Song’s concern.   The person who appeared at the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion was Han Feiyu. What does that have to do with me, He Song?   “I am a loose cultivator, Han Feiyu. I have some spirit rice that I want to sell. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎  May I ask if you would like to discuss the details, fellow Daoist?”   Upon entering the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion and seeing someone approaching him, He Song immediately greeted them with a cupped-fist salute, changing his original voice to a muffled tone.   At this time, He Song’s cultivation level was at the sixth -tier of Qi Refining.   Although he had used the Breath Concealment Formulas to hide his cultivation level, under He Song’s control, he could still release a trace of spiritual pressure corresponding to the sixth-tier of Qi Refining.   The appearance of this trace of spiritual pressure would ensure others would not underestimate He Song, and it would also not reveal any aura, preventing others from identifying him based on the aura.   In the Immortal Pavilion…   A sixth-tier Qi Refining cultivator was already quite impressive.   If one could break through to the late stage of Qi Refining, they would indeed be considered a person of importance within the Immortal Pavilion.   Even in the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion, where there were more cultivators compared to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, the situation remained the same.   Most late-stage Qi Refining cultivators gathered in Green Wall Immortal City, while there were very few of them in the pavilions of the Immortal City.   With He Song’s sixth-tier Qi Refining cultivation, his cultivation level was already considered quite high.   Of course…   The person in front of He Song dared not neglect him.   “So, it’s Senior Han. Please follow me to the VIP room. The manager will discuss in detail with you.”   This was a young man with only First-tier Qi Refining.    Upon hearing He Song’s words, he immediately offered a cupped-fist salute to He Song and then led him to the VIP room.   Once He Song was brought into the VIP room…   He first brewed a pot of tea for He Song before retreating and leaving.   Soon…   The door to the VIP room was opened once again, and a handsome young man walked in calmly.   “I am Jiang Jun, the manager responsible for purchasing spirit medicines and spirit rice at the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion. I’ve heard about you, Mr. Han.”   As soon as he entered the room, he greeted He Song with a slight bow and a smile.   He Song also returned the polite greeting.   After some casual conversation…   The two of them sat facing each other, and Jiang Jun took a sip of tea to prepare for the transaction.   “May I have a look at the spirit rice, Mr. Han?”   Jiang Jun’s cultivation was the same as He Song’s, both at the sixth-tier of Qi Refining.   Presumably, there was no falsehood in his statement of being the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Upon hearing Jiang Jun’s words, He Song quickly took a small cargo storage bag out of his black robe.   Placing it on the table with a thud, he indicated that Jiang Jun could check at will.   The small cargo storage bag contained a full twenty-two thousand catties of spirit rice.   As for the other few hundred catties of spirit rice, He Song had left them at his Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion residence for his everyday consumption.   On the side…   Jiang Jun, after receiving He Song’s permission, quickly picked up the small cargo storage bag.   As he probed it with his spirit power, Jiang Jun’s eyebrows raised, and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.   “There’s a total of twenty-two thousand catties of spirit rice. The color is full, the grains are round, it must be high-quality spirit rice produced in a rich spirit Qi area.”   Glancing at He Song, he saw that He Song was calm and seemed to have anticipated his words.   Seeing this, Jiang Jun pondered for a moment before speaking again.   “Does Mr. Han want to sell this spirit rice? These are all high-quality spirit rice. I am willing to buy them at the price of two thousand spirit stones. What do you think?”   For twenty-two thousand catties of high-quality spirit rice, the market price was two thousand two hundred spirit stones.   However, the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion had to take a 10% cut as profit.   After calculations, He Song should’ve received one thousand nine hundred and eighty spirit stones.   However, the price Jiang Jun mentioned was a full two thousand spirit stones.   Though it was only twenty stones more than the original price, these twenty stones were beyond He Song’s expectations.   Why would someone be so eager to overpay?   “Daoist Jiang, isn’t it supposed to be one thousand nine hundred and eighty spirit stones? How did it become two thousand?”

Chapter 101: Chapter 100: Deal Concluded   Translator: 549690339   Faced with such a sudden favor, He Songs eyes were filled with alertness right away.   This person.   What exactly does he want to do?   Round-off from the opposite direction?   Does he intend to curry favor with me in exchange for a small kindness while he has the chance?   But why should he?   I have done nothing more than sell some spirit rice; what is there to curry favor with?   The more than 22,000 jin of spirit rice is only the yield of a ten-acre spirit field for two years, by any measure, its not much.   Moreover, Jiang Jun in front of me does not need to pay for these 2,000 spirit stones.   The spirit stones to purchase such spirit rice and spirit medicine are all paid by the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   The reason for Jiang Juns visit was simply to handle the transaction once, these spirit stones have nothing to do with him.   Therefore.   Why does Jiang Jun want to raise the price slightly?   What is his intention?   However.   Just as He Song was full of vigilance in his heart and felt that Jiang Jun must have an intention, he suddenly thought of a possibility.   Could it be this person wants a kickback?   Given Jiang Juns responsibility to purchase spirit medicine and spirit rice, the only place he can get a gray income as the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion is here.   When purchasing spirit medicine, or spirit rice, slightly raise the price for the other party.   And then, split the profit with the other party.   In this way, both parties benefit and share mutual interests.   The motivation for Jiang Jun to raise the price suddenly became clear. Thinking of this, He Songs gaze at Jiang Jun suddenly took on a strange color.   Mr. Han, just listen to me for a moment. Your spirit rice is of excellent quality, with full grains and a wealth of spirit Qi inside. It truly is top-quality spirit rice with excellent quality.   I am offering this price under certain conditions.   If Mr. Han agrees with me, if there is any spirit rice to be sold in the future, I will buy all the spirit rice at the price of 2,000 spirit stones.   I wonder what Mr. Han thinks.   As he spoke, a small piece of paper appeared in Jiang Juns hand.   As his words continued, a trace of spirit power surged out from his fingertips, engraving line after line of characters on the paper.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m    By the time his words had fallen.   Jiang Jun waved the paper in front of He Song as he made a slight gesture.   As cultivators have astonishing eyesight, He Song naturally caught a glimpse of the characters on the paper.   Mr. Han, we split these twenty spirit stones fifty-fifty, you put the ten spirit stones into the small cargo storage bag.   With a sweep of his eyes.   He Song finally understood.   At the same time, his look at Jiang Jun became even more strange.   Indeed.   Almost every cultivator in the middle management of the Immortal Pavilion has his gray income.bender   Just like Jiang Jun, Zhao Lin, and even He Song himself.   They just have different ways to get their gray income.   Jiang Jun manipulates the purchase price and can gain a profit of ten spirit stones each time.   Zhao Lin manipulates the recruitment process into the Immortal Pavilion, and the spirit stones he gained from each recruitment should not be few.   He Song himself manipulates the loss of the Medicine Garden, and the loss over a year also gains him a dozen or more spirit stones.   He Song had not thought before that Jiang Juns gray income would come in this way.   And judging by the situation, Jiang Jun was well-versed in doing this, it seemed his usual gains were not small.   Yes, if there are more spirit rice to sell in the future, I will certainly come to seek Brother Jiang.    Seeing that Jiang Jun has no hostility and just wants to make money, after a little thought, He Song immediately agreed when he felt there was no problem.   Even to lessen the distance between them, he didnt hesitate to call him Brother Jiang.   He picked up the small cargo storage bag at his side, and with a thought, ten spirit stones were promptly placed inside.   On the other hand.   After seeing He Songs action, the smile on Jiang Juns face also vanished in a flash.   Opportunities to make ten spirit stones like this are rare.   If it wasnt for the high quality of He Songs spirit rice, he wouldnt have got such an opportunity.   In that case, I will be waiting for Brother Han here. In the future, if I get a chance, I will definitely invite Brother Han for a good drink!   The deal was closed.   Both sides got what they wanted.   Naturally. they had a good time together. and after a toast with tea as a   substitute for wine, the deal quickly ended.   With 1990 spirit stones in hand.    He Song bade Jiang Jun farewell and immediately rushed to the inn of the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion.   Every Immortal Pavilion has several inns. A few foreign cultivators, with no temporary place to stay and not wishing to leave the Immortal Pavilion at night, will reside in these inns.   However, the daily rate of the inn is much more expensive than renting a room.   It costs one spirit stone a day.   Ordinarily, very few cultivators rent rooms in the inn unless they are rich and do not wish to stay long.   Staying in an inn costs thirty spirit stones per month, while renting a room on the outer circle of the Immortal Pavilion costs only ten spirit stones per month.   That is to say.   If the loose cultivators can grit their teeth and afford to stay in the rooms of the outer circle of the Immortal Pavilion for a while.   Then the inn is not a place prepared for ordinary loose cultivators.   The spirit Qi here is rich, even up to the standard of the inner circle of the Immortal Pavilion and at the same time, Array Skills exist, which can hide everything in the room and prevent any disturbance.   Of course, with the existence of array skills, the cost of staying in an inn is naturally higher for a good reason.   After renting a room in the inn for five more days.   He Song quickly entered the room, immediately activated the concealment Array of the inn, and hid all the Qi within his room.   Afterwards.   He Song didnt even look at the rustic decorations in the room and quickly took off his black robe.   As soon as the fire in the room was lit, He Songs black robe was instantly turned to ashes.   At the same time, He Song activated the Object Controlling Skills to maneuver spirit power to cleanse himself and the two storage bags on his body.   When he had washed himself and the two storage bags with spirit power, ensuring that not a single tracking mark would be left, He Song then took out another black robe and draped it over himself.   Suddenly.   His figure immediately tunneled underground, shot out of the inn in an instant, and quickly fled far away from the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion, dashing towards the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion in the west at an extreme speed.   This.   Is the escape plan that He Song had thought of long ago.   After selling the spirit rice, He Song couldnt ensure that he would not be watched by others.   But, as soon as he moves into the inn, those who are watching him will definitely be waiting outside the inn.   Killing is forbidden in the Immortal Pavilion.   This is especially true in the inn.   Of course, there is no need to worry about security issues.   And he, as soon as he moves into the inn, activates the concealment Array in the inn to hide all Qi.   In this way.   Even if he tunnels underground and flees away with the Earth Tunneling Skill in the next moment.   As long as he keeps using the Breath Concealment Formulas, no one will notice him who is hidden underground..

Chapter 102: Chapter 101: Carrying a Huge Sum of Money   Translator: 549690339   At the same time, by paying the room fee for five days; a total cost of five spirit stones to stay for five days, he could also stall those who were waiting outside the inn, making them continue waiting outside.   Not seeing him leave, even if they had their suspicions, they would probably still wait.   If he had been marked with a tracking skill, it would be ineffective after burning his clothes and using spirit power to cleanse his body.   Tracking skills also needed a carrier.   This was the information He Song obtained after asking Wei Fan, a Qi-refining late stage cultivator who had already learned the tracking skill.   It could be said,   He Song had made thorough preparations.   No matter if he was being targeted, He Song had a perfect counter-strategy.   A high-quality tracking skill?   With clothes burned, there would be no tracking marks left.   After cleansing the body and storage bag with spirit power, any tracking marks, if there were any, would be washed away and become ineffective. The spirit stones were stored in the storage bag, making it impossible to track them.   As such, the high-quality tracking skills would have no effect on He Song.   It was precisely for this reason,   He Song carried out everything perfectly step by step after entering the inn.   Immediately after, he used Earth Tunneling to leave Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion.   Since the spirit rice had been sold,   He had acquired 1990 spirit stones.   It was naturally time to run away.   All the way to the west, He Song followed his memory, while rushing towards Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, he was also constantly vigilant, not daring to slack off at all.   Just having acquired nearly two thousand spirit stones,   He Song didnt want to end up a corpse before he could even enjoy his wealth.   Therefore, caution was the only thing he needed to do at the moment.   As for other things,   For example, eating the spicy rabbit head at the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion that would have to wait until next time.   Carrying a huge sum of money, if someone targeted him, it would be a life-and-death situation. Putting himself in danger for the sake of satisfying his appetite, was something He Song would never do.bender   Moreover, He Song didnt want to buy artifacts and spirit amulets at the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion.   In addition to being time-consuming, purchasing artifacts and spirit amulets in the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion would also easily draw more attention.    Increasing the danger to himself.   It he took these artifacts back to Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and was asked about their origins while using them, how would he respond?   Wouldnt that be exposing himself?   As such,   It would be better to grab the spirit stones and run towards Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   With the spirit stones in his possession, as an amulet Tao master, it wouldnt be noticed if he slowly spent them over time.   Whats wrong with being a little bit richer as an amulet Tao master?   Once he had acquired the proper artifacts, spirit amulets, and skills, his combat power would increase, and as an amulet Tao master, there would naturally be no one who would dare to target him.   After all, offending a powerful amulet Tao master was not a wise move.   Whats more, this amulet Tao master had several friends in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and also had the backing of a Qi Refining late stage friend there.   Naturally, his safety would be greatly enhanced.   Once his fighting power was sufficient to deal with these situations, the remaining spirit stones could be used by He Song for his cultivation.   Elixirs, Spirit-Gathering Array, spirit rice, spiritual materials, spirit tea and so on.   As long as it could improve his cultivation speed, He Song would certainly not let it slip through his fingers.   These things,   He could not enjoy them before due to a lack of spirit stones.   Now that he had spirit stones, it was natural for him to make use of them. By then, He Songs cultivation speed would naturally become extremely exaggerated.   Beyond breaking through the Qi-refining late stage.   Even breaking through the Foundation Establishment was just around the corner!   A day passed in the blink of an eye.   The next day.   He Songs figure suddenly appeared in the quiet chamber inside his house at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   After glancing around and finding no traces of anyone entering, He Song breathed a sigh of relief and put the medium-grade Thick Earth Amulet in his storage bag.   With more than two thousand spirit stones worth of fortune on his body, He Song at this moment could be said to be extremely cautious.   Although he didnt encounter any danger while visiting the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion to sell spirit rice, He Song dared not be careless.   Walking in the Cultivation World, where killings and looting were commonplace.   Perhaps, with just a moment of carelessness, he would become a corpse.   He Song didnt want to experience that.   He was also unwilling to go through that.    However, now that he had safely returned to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, He Songs originally vigilant state gradually relaxed.   Although still cautious, he no longer had the knee-jerk reaction to flee at the slightest sound as before.   Sitting cross-legged in the quiet chamber.   He Song casually activated the Illusion Array and the Five Phases Array that were set up in the quiet chamber.   After learning the Five Phases Array, He Song, for the sake of safety, also set up a Five Phases Array in his quiet chamber.   When the quiet chamber became extremely safe and undisturbed, only then did He Song take out a spirit stone from his storage bag to examine carefully.   First, buy some amulet-making materials to practice, become an official amulet Tao master, and then slowly make amulets while gradually laundering these two thousand spirit stones.   For every batch of laundered spirit stones, I can use some to buy what I need.   Offensive and defensive artifacts, mana robes, spirit amulets, elixirs, various skills, all need to be purchased and learned.   Only in this way, can people not doubt the source of these spirit stones and can I be disconnected from the spirit rice matter, without being discovered by anyone.   After contemplating and listing the things he needed to do next in his heart, He Song quickly determined the next course of action.   First, it was to buy amulet-making materials.   Once his success rate in drawing the Golden Light Amulet and Divine Movement Amulet exceeded 50%, he would officially become an amulet Tao master.   Next, he would continue to buy amulet-making materials, draw spirit amulets and sell them. In this way, the number of spirit stones on He Song would only grow.   However, others only knew that He Song earned quite a few spirit stones by making amulets.   But they wouldnt know how many spirit stones he had exactly.   Only He Song himself knew the specific number of spirit stones.   By doing this, there would naturally be more room for maneuver.   As long as it wasnt too outrageous, even if He Song took out more spirit stones to purchase cultivation resources, others would only envy him and wouldnt guess that he was laundering spirit stones.   By then, He Song could openly use the more than two thousand spirit stones on him without arousing suspicion.   Even if the Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion started to trace the origin of the spirit rice, He Song wouldnt need to worry about anyone tracing it back to him.   An official amulet Tao master.   That role could actually earn quite a few spirit stones as well.   If the success rate of drawing medium-grade spirit amulets also increased to over 50%, the earnings would, of course, be even higher. This plan, though time-consuming, was much safer for He Song.   Time.   It was precisely what he had no shortage of.   Safety was what he had always wanted to pursue.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates   With that in mind, He Song stood up.   He put the spirit stone in his hand into his storage bag, opened the door, and went straight to the Stall Section to buy amulet-making materials.   In this way, time flew by, and He Song, with a fortune on him, felt reinvigorated every day while making amulets.   Until.

Chapter 103: Chapter 102: Four Years Later   Translator: 549690339   Until … four years later.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Inside the quiet chamber.   Thickly-packed spirit stones were laid out, filled with dense Spirit Qi that enveloped He Song entirely.   As time passed, the spirit power within He Song’s body also started to surge crazily at this moment.   He Song furrowed his brows, spiritual power circulating throughout his body. A strong spiritual pressure immediately radiated from him, enveloping the entire quiet chamber under its tremendous force.   But at this moment, He Song didn’t pay any attention to the outside scenario at all. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com  Inside his body.   The circulating Spirit Power was operating at an extremely fast rate, ceaselessly rushing through the meridians within his body.   Soon.   A sensation of touching some kind of bottleneck emerged in He Song’s mind.   Half a year ago, He Song’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the sixth-tier Qi Refining.   And in this half year, He Song had been constantly trying to break through to the seventh-tier Qi Refining. However, after several attempts, he was still unable to overcome the bottleneck.   Nevertheless, He Song gained considerable benefits in the process of repeatedly challenging the bottleneck.   And after failing at the last stretch during the previous bottleneck challenge, when he felt the bottleneck loosening, He Song was sure.   He could rely on his strength to break through the bottleneck of the   Qi-refining late stage, and he didn’t need to save spirit stones to buy the Breakthrough Elixir in Green Wall Immortal City for breakthrough like Meng Guan.   This was the gap in their natural endowments.   Meng Guan only had five spirits roots, while He Song had four.   Therefore, Meng Guan was stuck in the sixth-tier Qi Refining, unable to progress even a little in several years.   On the other hand, He Song felt the bottleneck had already started to loosen in half a year. And he was about to break through to the seventh-tier Qi Refining soon.   With five spirit roots, the qualification is too poor. Unless they have enough resources, there is hardly any chance for a cultivator with five spirit roots to break through to the Foundation Establishment.   But for those with four spirit roots, even if they cultivate step by step without ample resources, they would still have a chance of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment before the age of sixty.   Although they do not have the Foundation Establishment Elixir, even though chances of forcibly breaking through are small, there is still a chance.   Maybe they would succeed if they were lucky?    Although such lucky ones are scarce, they do exist.   At least, they were much better than those with five spirits roots.   Meng Guan, with his five spirits roots, had staked his life for such a chance.   When the spirit power inside his body began to operate at high speed, an intense spiritual pressure enveloped the entire quiet chamber. He Song vaguely felt the moment of the bottleneck.   He Song took a deep breath. Then, he continued to control the spirit power inside his body without any distraction.   Thanks to his mastery of Object Controlling Skills, He Song had extremely high mastery over the spirit power within his body.   This point.   It was vividly demonstrated when he wanted to accelerate the operation of the spirit power in his body.   The previous breakthrough, it failed when just a step away.   But it let He Song sense the loosening of the bottleneck.   This time, success is assured!   Such a thought flashed across He Song’s mind, and a wave of strong confidence surged into his heart at this moment.   Operating the spirit power, breaking through the bottleneck, it’s now!   At a certain moment.   Within the quiet chamber.   He Song, who was sitting quietly, suddenly trembled.   “Qi-refining late stage, made it!”   Letting out a light shout, He Song didn’t stand up, but instead continued to operate the Thick Earth Formulas, starting to solidify his cultivation.   Just having broken through to the Qi-refining late-stage, a minor lapse could lead to a decline in one’s realm. Naturally, consolidating my cultivation base is of utmost importance at this moment.   As He Song started to circulate the Thick Earth Formulas.   Swiftly, the rich spirit Qi in the quiet room flocked over, enveloping He Song’s entire body.   Inside the quiet room, countless spirit stones provided a vast amount of spirit Qi for He Song to absorb.   The vast spirit Qi drawn in by the Spirit-Gathering Array also flowed into He Song’s body.   Almost in the blink of an eye.   The originally dense spirit Qi in the room visibly thinned a bit.   However, He Song had prepared for such a situation.   From the piles of spirit stones placed in the quiet room, a large amount of spirit Qi was quickly gushing out, restoring the density of the spirit Qi.   With a vast amount of spirit Qi enveloping his body, He Song felt as if he were immersed in a sea of spirit Qi.    He just needed to casually operate the spirit power within his body, and wisps of spirit Qi from the outside would be absorbed into his body, transforming into his own spirit power.   In a condition where there are sufficient spirit stones and he is still in the Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song almost does not have to worry about the concentration of the spirit Qi outside. He just needs to absorb the spirit Qi into his body.   As such, the time for He Song to consolidate his cultivation base will greatly decrease.   Just saying.   During usual times, when breakthrough to the seventh-tier Qi Refining occurs, one needs a month’s time to consolidate the cultivation base.   However, at this moment, under such a dense concentration of spirit Qi, He Song only needs ten days to fully consolidate his cultivation base, and will no longer let his cultivation base fall from the seventh-tier Qi Refining.   However.   While absorbing spirit Qi to consolidate his cultivation, He Song secretly rejoiced.   Qi-refining late stage!   After many years of cultivation, he had finally reached the Qi-refining late stage!   From being a first-tier Qi Refining cultivator to now a seventh-tier Qi Refining cultivator, the difference in status is extremely significant.   At Qi Refining first- tier, being at the very bottom of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, anyone who saw him could trample him.   At seventh-tier Qi Refining, though, he is at the Qi-refining late stage. Even though he still remains at the very bottom in the Cultivation World, his status within the small Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion is drastically different. Qi-refining late stage cultivators can have Immortal Pavilions offer small   Qi-refining late stage cultivators can have Immortal Pavilions offer free steward positions to lean on.   Qi-refining late stage cultivators can safely walk within the Immortal Pavilion and Immortal City without much danger to worry about.   Though they are all in the Qi Refining stage, the gap in status between the two is substantial.   At least.   Right now, in this small Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, He Song has become one of the few people standing at the top of the pyramid.   Except for one Foundation Establishment Master atop his head, there is no one   However, after meticulously calculating the time, He Song’s eyes suddenly flashed with a hint of vicissitudes.   Five years ago.   He Song met Su Yan. Back then, He Song had calculated the time since he arrived in this world.   At that time, seventeen years had passed since he came to this world and became a first-tier Qi Refining little cultivator.   But now, another five years have passed.   He Song has been in this world for a full twenty-two years!   Twenty-two years of time, from being a first- tier Qi Refining small cultivator to the current seventh-tier Qi Refining late-stage cultivator.   Only He Song himself knows the difficulties he has experienced in this journey.   From the initial carefulness when he just arrived in this world.   To the now jubilant entry into the seventh-tier Qi Refining, the psychological journey during this period made He Song nostalgic.   “Past experiences are like fleeting clouds of smoke. The Qi-refining late stage is merely the starting point of cultivation. In the future, I still need to cultivate cautiously. Considering my status, if I were to die inexplicably, it would truly be a loss.”   As He Song was consolidating his cultivation base using the Thick Earth Formulas and recounting past events, he was even more determined to stay cautious..

Chapter 104: Chapter 103 Attempting Foundation Establishment   Translator: 549690339   It was thanks to his naturally cautious nature that he had made it this far.   If it weren’t for his caution, he might have died several times already.   If it weren’t for his caution, he might not even have a trace of his bones left at this moment.   If it weren’t for his caution, let alone breaking through to the late stage of Qi-refining in twenty-two years, it would have been great if he could have lived past twenty-two years.   As He Song thought about this, an image suddenly appeared in his mind.   Su Yan.   Since reuniting with Su Yan five years ago, she would occasionally invite He Song to meet up and chat.   Now, five years had passed in the blink of an eye, and the relationship between Su Yan and He Song was relatively good.   Although, she was not regarded as a friend by He Song.   However, thanks to Su Yan’s feelings for He Song when they were young, He Song did not reject her completely during their occasional meetings.   A little girl with no relatives left in the world, although He Song wouldn’t give her much special treatment, it was not impossible for him to be friends with her and talk.   At this moment, He Song thought of Su Yan because he thought of her grandfather, Su Jin.   How many twenty-two years can one have in life?   Many years ago, He Song could still remember Su Jin’s expression when he allowed Su Yan to pester for candy.   But now…   The people from the past were gone.   Only Su Yan, who had grown up, was still living in this world.   When a person dies, it is like a lamp going out, and everything in this world has nothing to do with him or her.   With Su Jin’s image flashing in his mind, He Song shook his head and sighed, quickly recovering his mentality.   People are bound to die.   But, he was an exception.   Therefore, he still needed to get used to this kind of parting between life and death.   Continuing to practice the Thick Earth Formulas, He Song steadily consolidated his cultivation, preventing his cultivation from dropping to the sixth-tier Qi Refining.   Soon.   Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.    He Song completely stabilized his cultivation, reaching the seventh-tier Qi Refining.   At the same time, it meant that He Song had truly stepped into the upper ranks of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com  The first thing He Song did after leaving his seclusion was to seek out Wei Fan.   Spirit Construction Pavilion.   As He Song’s figure appeared on the second floor of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, Wei Fan was frowning at a thin piece of paper without a word.   Even when He Song sat down beside him, Wei Fan’s expression didn’t change. Seeing this, He Song was slightly startled, and couldn’t help but wonder about the information on the paper.   However, although he was curious, He Song didn’t peek, but just sat quietly next to Wei Fan and waited.   It was worth mentioning that…   Wei Fan’s cultivation had already broken through to the ninth-tier Qi Refining three years ago.   At this moment, Wei Fan was also a great master at the ninth-tier Qi Refining.   Among those below the Foundation Establishment Realm, Wei Fan was also one of the top few.   However, his cultivation progress was slightly slower.   You should know that Wei Fan was already at the eighth-tier of Qi Refining when He Song’s cultivation was only at the fifth-tier Qi Refining. (From Chapter 69.)   Counting the time, Wei Fan broke through to the eighth-tier Qi Refining during He Song’s ninth year since he had traveled to this world.   After that, ten more years passed, and it was only three years ago that he finally broke through from the eighth-tier Qi Refining to the ninth-tier Qi Refining.   In such a long time, even He Song’s cultivation progressed from the initial first-tier Qi Refining to the present seventh- tier Qi Refining. However, Wei Fan’s cultivation had only increased by two small realms.   As one could imagine,   Wei Fan’s speed in breaking through his cultivation was quite slow.   However, it might also be because once He Song set up the Spirit-Gathering Array and subsequently acquired a large number of spirit stones, his cultivation speed became extremely fast.   At the same time, after reaching the Qi-refining late stage, a cultivator’s breakthrough speed would slow down.   He Song had just broken through to the seventh-tier Qi Refining and didn’t know how fast the Qi-refining late stage would take.   But with He Song’s current wealth, he could choose to purchase the Thick Earth Sect’s Crumbled Jade Powder to speed up his cultivation during the Qi-refining late stage.   On the side, Wei Fan was still intently watching.   As He Song was getting bored while waiting, a streak of light flashed across the sky, and a sound- transmitting paper crane instantly appeared in front of He Song.   Seeing this, He Song’s face showed surprise, and he immediately released his breath, allowing the paper crane to turn into a piece of paper, which fell into his hand.   Picking up the paper, He Song was suddenly shocked.   “Mr. He, I have spent fourteen years in Green Wall Immortal City, and now, I am fifty-nine, less than a month away from my sixtieth birthday.”    “Today, I finally achieved Qi Refining great perfection, and soon, I will attempt Foundation Establishment.”   “In my life, I have only had the friendship of two people – Mr. He and Wei. On the day of my breakthrough, I naturally want to join hands with you both.”   “I, Meng Guan, am waiting for your arrival in Green Wall Immortal City.” “If I succeed this time, I will never forget the friendship between us.”   “If I fail, I hope you two friends can handle the matters that follow.”   “Meng Guan. ”   Looking at the lines of text on the paper, He Song suddenly felt the surrounding air become quiet.   It was so quiet that a needle drop could be heard all around. The entire world seemed to have gone deaf, leaving him with an endless sense of loneliness.   In just fourteen short years, Meng Guan had managed to cultivate his Qi   This peak refers to the full accumulation of spirit power within the body, which is ready to break through to Foundation Establishment. This is the peak, or the Qi Refining great perfection.   Fourteen years!   Five Spirits Roots!   Looking at Wei Fan, who was also staring in a daze, He Song’s heart was filled with mixed feelings.   It was terrifying to think about breaking through from the seventh-tier Qi Refining to the peak of ninth-tier Qi Refining within fourteen years with Five Spirits Roots’ qualification.   Keep in mind that it took Wei Fan nineteen years to break through from the seventh-tier Qi Refining to the ninth-tier Qi Refining – and that wasn’t even the peak of ninth-tier Qi Refining!   Wei Fan had the Four Spirits Roots!   His cultivation speed was faster than Meng Guan’s Five Spirits Roots.   However, even so,   Meng Guan still achieved his goal and raised his cultivation to the Qi Refining great perfection just a month short of his sixtieth birthday.   Such speed.   Such determination.   Such opportunity.   He Song couldn’t help but suspect whether his friend Meng Guan had awakened some memories from a past life or had gained a terrifying opportunity during these fourteen years.   Otherwise, Meng Guan’s cultivation speed would absolutely not be so fast! After carefully calculating, He Song quickly concluded that Meng Guan’s words were not false.   When He Song was at the third-tier Qi Refining, Meng Guan had already left the Immortal Pavilion to become a minor leader at the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   After three years, Meng Guan returned and asked Wei Fan to take him to Green Wall Immortal City to purchase a Breakthrough Elixir.   While buying the Breakthrough Elixir, He Song remembered Meng Guan mentioning his age.   Meng Guan had already turned forty-three when he left for the Red Spirit Gold   Mine.   Three years later, he was forty-six.   Now, including the past fourteen years, Meng Guan is about a month shy of sixty years old..

Chapter 105: Chapter 104: Qi Refining 7th Layer   Translator: 549690339   And breakthrough to Foundation Establishment.   It is best to break through before the age of sixty, after sixty, the chances of success decrease with every passing year.   This is because the peak period for Qi-refining late stage cultivators is at their breakthrough moment, around sixty years old, after which they start to decline from their peak.   Naturally, the chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment also gradually decrease year by year.   In this case, even without a Foundation Establishment Elixir, he can try to forcibly break through to attempt Foundation Establishment.   Though such an approach without the assistance of an elixir would mean that if the Foundation Establishment fails, he might be severely injured or even die.   However, it is still much better than having no chance at all.   Presumably…   Meng Guan invited He Song and Wei Fan this time because of his concerns.   If his breakthrough fails and he dies, if there are no friends nearby, there might be no one to collect his remains.   Establishing the Foundation has a relatively high death rate.   In the absence of a Vein Protection Elixir or a Foundation Establishment Elixir.   Forcing a breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment realm, if it fails, could result in severe injury, or even death on the spot.   Generally, Qi Refining great perfection cultivators who want to attempt establishing the Foundation would buy elixirs.   Those with good luck can get a Foundation Establishment Elixir, which increases the chances of success and protects them in case of failure.   With a Foundation Establishment Elixir, even if the breakthrough fails, the cultivator won’t be heavily injured and can challenge the Foundation Establishment realm again after recovering for two years.   Those with less luck can only buy a Vein Protection Elixir, which doesn’t increase the chances of success but protects them if the breakthrough fails.   With a Vein Protection Elixir, even if the breakthrough fails, the cultivator won’t be injured, and they can challenge the Foundation Establishment realm again after recovering for five years.   Of course…   There are also cultivators like Meng Guan who have made no preparations at all.   If successful, they will achieve the Master of the Foundation Establishment, and their lifespan will surge.   If unsuccessful, a large proportion of them will die and the luckier ones will suffer serious injuries, losing hope for establishing the Foundation.   The Foundation Establishment Elixir is very expensive and rare. Although the Vein Protection Elixir is cheaper, its effect makes it quite valuable.   Given Meng Guan’s financial capabilities, He Song thought it would be difficult for him to purchase it.    This time Meng Guan issued an invitation.   First, he wanted a friend’s company.   Second, he wanted He Song and Wei Fan to protect him.   Third, he probably wanted to see his friends for the last time.   “Lao Meng has reached the great perfection of Qi Refining, and I have only broken through the ninth-tier of Qi Refining for three years. Sigh…”   As He Song silently looked at the paper in his hand, his thoughts drifting, Wei Fan’s voice suddenly came into his ears.   Looking up, He Song saw that the paper in Wei Fan’s hand had disappeared, but a trace of worry appeared on his face.   Seeing He Song put away his paper, Wei Fan shook his head with a bitter smile.   “This Lao Meng is truly unbelievable. If he truly breaks through to the Foundation Establishment realm, do you think we should call him Master Lao Meng?”   Master Lao Meng…   A strange look flashed in He Song’s eyes.   If they really called him that, Meng Guan, who broke through to the Foundation Establishment, would probably let Wei Fan experience what was truly the wrath of a Master, right?   But seeing the expression on Wei Fan’s face, He Song still didn’t say this out loud. Instead, he shook his head and sighed.   “Sigh, Meng Guan really must have gone through a lot during these fourteen years. I wonder how he managed to persevere.”   A Five Spirits Roots cultivator.   From needing a Breakthrough Elixir to break through the Qi Refining late stage initially.   To breaking through from the seventh- tier Qi Refining to Qi Refining great perfection in the span of fourteen years.   Such a terrifying cultivation speed made He Song feel ashamed.   One can imagine what Meng Guan went through in Green Wall Immortal City over those years.   Maybe there were opportunities.   Maybe there were surprises.   Or maybe, there were some secrets unknown to He Song.   In any case, Meng Guan’s desperate path to Foundation Establishment was now only a small distance away from completion.   And for this last little distance.   He wanted He Song and Wei Fan to witness it together!   Whether to live or die, it all depends on this time!    “Who knows? He has been away for fourteen years without returning, probably desperately fighting in Green Wall Immortal City, just like he said before, risking his life to create a path leading to Foundation Establishment.”   Faced with He Song’s sigh, Wei Fan echoed his sentiment, but immediately, his eyes flashed with anticipation.   Meng Guan’s invitation this time not only shocked Wei Fan but also sparked a longing for the Foundation Establishment realm.   His friend was about to break through to the Foundation Establishment and invited him to witness it, so naturally, he was looking forward to it.   If he could learn something from Meng Guan.   It would be of great help to his future path in Foundation Establishment.   However, when his gaze met He Song’s, Wei Fan’s eyes flashed with a moment of realization, substituting his previous astonishment. He even forgot what he wanted to say earlier.   At this moment.   Wei Fan’s gaze was fixed on He Song, and his mouth gradually opened wide. “You, you, you’ve reached the seventh-tier Qi Refining?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m  It took a moment for Wei Fan to recover from his shock and questioned He Song.   Even though he had already used his Spirit Vision Skill to see He Song’s current cultivation level, he still wanted to confirm it through words.   According to his memory.   It seemed like He Song had broken through from the fifth-tier Qi Refining to the sixth-tier Qi Refining just five years ago.   But now.   In the blink of an eye, five years passed, and He Song’s cultivation had already successfully broken through from the sixth-tier Qi Refining to the seventh-tier Qi Refining.   What kind of speed is this?   He, Wei Fan, spent several years just to break through the bottleneck from the sixth-tier Qi Refining to the seventh-tier Qi Refining!   Several years!   Not to mention the time spent practicing from the sixth-tier Qi Refining to the peak of the sixth-tier Qi Refining, which also took him several years.   As for He Song?   Five years! He Song took only five years to raise his cultivation from the sixth-tier Qi Refining to the seventh-tier Qi Refining.   This is the seventh-tier Qi Refining!   In Immortal Pavilion, this is considered a high-level rank.   “Yes, I just consolidated my cultivation today and came to find Brother Wei.”   Facing the disbelief in Wei Fan’s eyes, He Song was completely unaware of anything amiss, and instead calmly replied.   In He Song’s view, spending four and a half years on cultivating the required spirit power needed for the sixth-tier Qi Refining and then working for half a year to break through the bottleneck of the Qi-refining late stage was completely normal.   Having faced the bottleneck for half a year, He Song, who had never experienced any bottleneck before, felt that it was already long enough.   However…   He could never imagine that the time other cultivators needed to break through the bottleneck was several or even ten times more than his!

Chapter 106: Chapter 105: Really Good Luck   Translator: 549690339   Wei Fan had been stuck at the Qi-refining late stage bottleneck for several years.   It is important to know.   Wei Fan had the same four spirits roots gift as He Song.   He had been stuck for years, and He Songs speed of breaking through the bottleneck in half a year was simply outrageous.   It was precisely because he was a loose cultivator and no one informed He Song of these news that he was able to say it so calmly.   Otherwise.   When he broke through the bottleneck in half a year, He Song would have realized that his speed of breaking through the bottleneck was several times faster than ordinary cultivators!Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com   The bottleneck is like a roadblock for cultivators, especially for those with poor qualifications.   Not making any progress for several years, or even a decade, is a very normal thing.   For example, Meng Guan, who has Five Spirits Roots, was also stuck at the Qi-refining late stage for more than a decade, and he finally broke through with the help of elixirs.   Wei Fan, who has four spirits roots, was also stuck at the Qi-refining late stage for several years.   But what about He Song?   When confronted with the bottleneck, which is daunting in the eyes of ordinary people, He Song merely needed half a year to successfully break through.   From this, one can see.   At this moment, Wei Fans heart was extremely shocked.   Could it be that you have three spirit roots?   Seeing He Songs casual reply, Wei Fan unconsciously blurted out.   But he shook his head immediately.   It shouldnt be. Your cultivation speed in Qi Refining Early Stage and mid stage wasnt much faster than those with four spirit roots.   Besides, if you really had three spirit roots, you should be seclusive cultivating in the Thick Earth Sect by now. How could you still be in the Immortal Pavilion?   Could it be your comprehension is too high?   After a series of mumbling to himself, Wei Fan finally came to a conclusion.   However, looking into He Songs eyes, Wei Fan also had doubts about the conclusion he had reached.   Comprehension is something that seems elusive.   But there are some external manifestations of it.   For example, during cultivation, there might be occasional moments of inspiration that would speed up ones progress.    Also, when practicing skills, one could quickly grasp and master the skill, much faster than ordinary cultivators.   And again, when learning the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, it took less time compared to other cultivators.   However, He Song in front of him did not seem to meet these conditions.   As for cultivation? In Wei Fans view, He Songs cultivation speed was just a bit faster than ordinary four spirits roots cultivators.   Especially in the early stage of Qi Refining, He Songs cultivation speed was simply indescribable.   It was only after breaking through the mid stage of Qi Refining that He Songs cultivation speed gradually increased, catching up with other four spirits roots cultivators, and even becoming faster.   However, it wasnt much faster.   It was nowhere near the cultivation speed of those with three spirit roots.   As for skills? Wei Fan had never seen He Song practice any skills, but if He   Song had any talent in that area, he would definitely show it in his daily life.   Cultivators, especially those with skill talents, would definitely use their skills as a means of fighting enemies.   In the Cultivation World, playing to ones strengths is the key to becoming stronger; this is a principle that all cultivators understand.   But what about He Song?   Wei Fan had known He Song for over twenty years, yet he had never seen He Song rely on any skills.   He had never even seen He Song use any skills other than the Sound Transmission Skill.   The Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth?   When recalling the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, a hint of curiosity appeared in Wei Fans eyes as he looked at He Song.   It is important to know.   At the time when He Song first mentioned the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth to him and Meng Guan, He Songs cultivation was only at the third-tier of Qi-refining.   Back then, He Song told them mysteriously that he had just bought a new copy of this cultivation book and was studying it.bender   Unexpectedly, over a dozen years had passed since then, and He Song never mentioned what he had learned from that cultivation book.   In the end, it was only a few years ago that He Song finally declared himself as an amulet Tao master.   Well considering the time it took, Wei Fan thought that it took He Song more than a decade to learn the most basic Amulet Tao Introduction. Hence, his comprehension must be quite poor.   Therefore, after drawing this conclusion, he thought he must be mistaken.   But there was no other explanation.   Finally.   Wei Fan sighed and felt that He Songs success might just be due to good luck. However, what he didnt know was that all he knew was what He Song showed on the surface.   The hidden talents of array tao and skills were completely unknown to him.    Sigh, having high comprehension still doesnt make sense. It seems that you really have good luck. Your bottlenecks were much weaker than mine at the time, said Wei Fan without asking He Songs opinion. His gaze towards He Song now showed a hint of envy.   If he could have broken through his bottleneck within half a year like He Song, he might not be here now. Instead, he would be an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   To become an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   The requirement is to break through to the Qi-refining late stage at a certain age.   Moreover, not everyone had this opportunity. Only those who are in the Thick Earth Mansion could enjoy this treatment.   Loose cultivators and those from the Immortal Pavilion, even if they met the conditions, would not be accepted as disciples.   A few years made him miss the chance to become an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   Up to now, Wei Fan still couldnt help but sigh when he thought about it.   At this moment.   Seeing He Song like this again naturally aroused envy in his heart.   I guess it was just my good luck, He Song didnt mind. He simply echoed Wei Fans conclusion.   At this moment, He Songs mind was still thinking about Meng Guans upcoming challenge to the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Since Meng Guan had already invited both him and Wei Fan, they must go to Green Wall Immortal City.   This time was not like the last.   Last time, He Songs cultivation was too low and there was no means to protect himself, so naturally, he wouldnt think of going to Green Wall Immortal City.   But this time it was completely different.   He Songs cultivation had reached the Qi-refining late stage, which meant that even if he went to Green Wall Immortal City alone, he wouldnt face any dangers.   Secondly, He Song had managed to get two thousand spirit stones four years ago.   In the seclusive cultivation for these four years, he had not been idle, creating two lower-grade artifacts for himself, one for attack and one for defense, as well as spirit amulets for protection.   He also learned some intermediate-grade skills.   It could be said that He Songs combat power was pretty strong at the Qi -refining mid -stage.   However, now that he had broken through to the Qi-refining late stage, the means he had prepared during the mid-stage were no longer that important.   Using low-grade artifacts at the Qi-refining late stage was indeed a bit shabby.   But up till now, He Songs cultivation was only at the Qi-refining mid-stage, and low-grade artifacts were enough for him.   However, now that he had broken through to the Qi-refining late stage, He Song planned to sell the two low-grade artifacts he had and use the spirit stones to buy one attack and one defense intermediate-grade artifact for himself.   Intermediate-grade artifacts were the most commonly used by Qi-refining late-stage cultivators.   With two intermediate-grade artifacts on him, He Song wouldnt have to worry about being weaker than cultivators of the same level.   Even if he couldnt defeat them.   He could still run away.   After all, with a defensive intermediate-grade artifact to protect himself, ordinary Qi-refining late-stage cultivators couldnt do anything to him..

Chapter 107: Chapter 106: 20 Acres of Spirit Field   Translator: 549690339   At the same time, he also carried attack-type, mid-quality Artifacts, so his opponents would be reluctant to attack him.   In addition to this.   Having already reached the Qi-refining late stage, He Song planned to buy some high-quality spirit amulets for self-protection.   Mid-quality amulets were not much use to He Song right now.   Only high-quality amulets could enhance He Songs strength.   Furthermore.   He needed to buy some life-saving amulets like the Earth Tunneling Amulet, which allowed him to tunnel ten miles underground in an instant, and other similar life-saving amulets.   Upon reaching the Qi-refining late stage, one needed to use spirit stones to strengthen their self-protection capabilities.   Fortunately.   He Song hadnt wasted all these years.   Four years had passed since he sold the spirit rice and obtained two thousand spirit stones.   In those four years, He Song had been busy cultivating and hadnt deliberately expanded his spirit fields; so naturally, he only had the ten acres of spirit fields in the valley.   He couldnt help it; he had considered developing more spirit fields elsewhere.   But after searching for half a month, he couldnt find a suitable location to develop a spirit field.   Either it was too close to the mortal world, or it was in an area frequently visited by cultivators, or it wasnt hidden well enough and had a high chance of being discovered.   After searching for half a month, he gave up at the time and decided to look for a location slowly in the future.   But who would have thought that four years would pass, and He Song still hadnt found a place as hidden and undisturbed by cultivators as the previous valley.   With no other choice, He Song could only develop ten more acres of spirit fields in that valley, filling up most of the available space.   Now, there were a total of twenty acres of spirit fields in the valley.   It took two years of nourishing the spirit Qi for a spirit field to form. The new spirit fields would yield their first batch of spirit rice in their third year.   Now that four years had passed, He Song had harvested spirit rice from the original ten acres of spirit fields four times and gained a total of 44,000 catties of spirit rice.   From the later-developed ten acres of spirit fields, he harvested spirit rice twice and got 22,000 more catties.            Adding them together,   He Song had earned a total of 67,000 catties of spirit rice from the valleys spirit fields in these four years.   However, aurmg tnose tour years, He song nad taKen out some oaa Dits ror nis own consumption, so the original 67,000 catties of spirit rice had been reduced to 66,000 catties.   Converted to spirit stones, He Song had earned a total of 6,600 spirit stones from his spirit fields in those four years.   Four years and 6,600 spirit stones.   It must be said that this income had greatly exceeded He Songs expectations.   Now, after developing twenty acres of spirit fields, he had become a wealthy man with an annual income of over 2,000 spirit stones.   At least during the Qi Refining stage, He Song no longer needed to worry about his cultivation resources.   That being said,   the newly obtained 66,000 catties of spirit rice were not rushed to be exchanged for spirit stones; on the contrary, He Song had kept them in his small cargo storage bag all along.   Four years ago, He Song sold 22,000 catties of spirit rice at Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion, receiving 1,990 spirit stones in hand.   He Song didnt know if the Thick Earth Sect was inquiring about the source of this spirit rice.   But he did know one thing.   If he sold 22,000 catties of spirit rice each year, he would definitely attract attention.   This would indirectly reveal that an area within the Thick Earth Sects territory had a hidden place producing 22,000 catties of spirit rice per year.   Twenty acres of spirit fields might not be many, but secretly establishing all that required certain important things, and thats what they were really interested in.   Without an Array Path Master, no one could do it.   If He Song did something like that, it would indirectly reveal that an Array Path Master had appeared within the Thick Earth Sects sphere of influence.   He Song would never take such a risk.   There were too many strange and innumerable skills in the Cultivation World.   If someone discovered his secret, his soul might be extracted, and he would suffer an agonizing pain every day and night.   He didnt want to taste that kind of life where he couldnt live or die.   As a result, he would rather keep the 66,000 catties of spirit rice in his small cargo storage bag than sell it off every year.   He would rather save it up over a few years and then sell it all at once.   By doing so, it could also play a confusing role.    After all, each time He Song sold spirit rice, he would change his appearance and shape, so he might be mistaken for a cultivator from the outside.   With various thoughts flashing through his mind,   He Song decided not to sell his spirit rice at this time.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com   The reason was simple.   Four years ago, He Song had already become a true amulet Tao master.   After four years of washing spirit stones, he had successfully laundered the additional 2,000 spirit stones he had obtained.   Even now, he still had more than a thousand spirit stones left.   Bear in mind that He Song had been cultivating at full speed over the past four years, spending spirit stones like water.   He spent them on elixirs, Artifacts, skills, spirit tea, spirit rice, demonic beast meat, and so on and so forth.   As long as any kind of resource could improve his cultivation level or combat power, He Song didnt skimp on it.   But despite all this, he still had more than a thousand spirit stones left.   If one counted the spirit stones he had spent in the past four years, there were as many as 3,000 spirit stones at his peak!   That was more than a thousand spirit stones than the 2,000 he obtained from selling spirit rice before.   He earned those extra thousand spirit stones as an amulet Tao master.   As an amulet Tao master, his speed of earning spirit stones wasnt slow. Although He Songs success rate for creating mid-quality Thick Earth Amulets hadnt reached fifty percent yet, even producing low-quality amulets was quite profitable.   Over four years, he had created and sold amulets, and earned an annual salary; so it was quite normal for He Song to have more than a thousand extra spirit stones.   In addition, He Song had recently launched an attack on the success rate of mid-quality Thick Earth Amulets.bender   Once He Song improved his success rate with mid-quality Thick Earth Amulets to over fifty percent, he would earn even more spirit stones.   As such, even though He Song had spent over 2,000 spirit stones in the past four years, he still had more than a thousand spirit stones left.   Over a thousand spirit stones, were enough to arm He Song himself and even have some left over.   Given that,   He Song decided not to sell any spirit rice and try to fatten his wallet quickly.   The less he sold spirit rice, the better.   By accumulating more spirit rice, he could obtain more spirit stones at once when he sold it.   Anyway, when he sold spirit rice, he usually sought out the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion of various Immortal Pavilions and didnt need to worry about their ability to pay spirit stones.   With this thought in mind, He Song quickly began to plan how to spend the spirit stones on himself..

Chapter 108: Chapter 107: Steward of the Immortal Pavilion   Translator: 549690339   First, naturally, he would replace the two low-grade Artifacts in his hands, one for offense and one for defense, with two mid-grade Artifacts for offense and defense.   Second, he would purchase high-quality spirit amulets and life-saving spirit amulets for protection and escaping danger.   Third…   He Song pondered for a long time but couldn’t think of what else he needed to do.   Skills? The studying time for high-quality skills was quite long, and if he went to buy them now, he might not even master them until a year later.   It would be of no help for his upcoming trip to Green Wall Immortal City.   With that, He Song simply shook his head and stopped thinking about it.   With Wei Fan accompanying him, the two Qi-refining late-stage cultivators didn’t have to worry too much about encountering danger.   Even if they did encounter danger, he could escape using a life-saving spirit amulet.   If a real fight happened, as long as he maintained his normal Qi-refining late-stage combat strengtn, It would De enougn.   Having one offensive and one defensive mid-grade Artifact, as well as some high-quality spirit amulets on hand, He Song’s combat power was also guaranteed.   At least, he wouldn’t be defeated quickly.   Thinking this way, He Song relaxed a bit, knowing that his more than a thousand spirit stones should be enough to change Artifacts and buy high-quality spirit amulets and life-saving spirit amulets.   “Brother Wei, since Lao Meng has invited us, when should we head to Green   Wall Immortal City? If you are in a hurry, I can prepare right away.”   Not needing to sell spirit rice, He Song naturally asked about their itinerary.   Meng Guan was in Green Wall Immortal City, He Song and Wei Fan had to hurry there.   After all, Meng Guan didn’t have much time left.   With less than a month left before he turned sixty, he wanted to make a breakthrough to Foundation Establishment before that age, so he had to seize every minute of this less than a month.   Meng Guan needed to make his body reach its peak state and then attempt to break through.   And this less than a month’s time was crucial.    “This matter came somewhat hastily, so let’s prepare and set off for Green Wall Immortal City tomorrow morning. At that time, with the two of us traveling together, there’s no need to worry about any problems,” Wei Fan said thoughtfully, his gaze occasionally falling on He Song. He was clearly still shocked at He Song’s breakthrough speed.   However, he soon seemed to remember something and slapped his forehead suddenly.   “Ah right, friend, since you’ve successfully broken through to the Qi-refining late-stage, if you don’t leave the Immortal Pavilion, you can just choose a department to serve as a Steward, and the Immortal Pavilion will also allocate a courtyard for you.”   “I wonder…”   Wei Fan’s eyes flashed a hint of happiness when he looked at He Song.   He Song had successfully broken through to the Qi-refining late-stage, and his own cultivation level was at the same stage.   He suddenly had a good friend at the Qi-refining late-stage cultivation level.   Naturally, as He Song’s friend, if he encountered any problems in the future, He Song’s current cultivation level should be able to help him out as well.   Now, the small circle that once belonged to just He Song, Wei Fan, and Meng Guan finally had all its members reach the Qi-refining late-stage.   This way, if something really happened, he wouldn’t be struggling alone.   Strength in numbers, that’s what it meant.   He already guessed in his heart if He Song would stay in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion or not.   Considering He Song’s careful personality, there was a good chance he would continue to stay in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   That way, their combined influence within Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion would naturally be different than before.   After all, they were now two Qi-refining late-stage cultivators.   “I came to see Brother Wei for this matter,” He Song said when Wei Fan asked about his intentions, explaining why he had come to Spirit Construction Pavilion immediately after consolidating his cultivation.   As he had guessed, He Song’s goal was to raise his position and move into a courtyard in the inner circle of the pavilion.   He had previously lived in Wei Fan’s small courtyard and hadn’t forgotten its advantages even now.   Not only was the spirit Qi denser.   Most importantly, he wouldn’t have to pay spirit stones for the allocated courtyard! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com  It would save all the rent.   And it was a permanent residence!   As long as He Song didn’t leave, he could continue living there, a great bargain indeed.    However, it was a bit close to Master Cheng Shan.   Most of the courtyards in the inner circle were within Master Cheng Shan’s divine sense scanning range.   He Song needed to choose a courtyard that was farther away from Cheng Shan, otherwise, if Cheng Shan scanned with his divine sense, he might detect something.   The Illusion Array, after all, was just an introductory Array Skill, and it couldn’t defend against divine sense scanning.   This was also the reason why He Song didn’t open a spirit field in a place where cultivators were always coming and going.   Only by staying out of the scanning range of Master Cheng Shan and other Foundation Establishment cultivators’ divine sense would He Song’s abnormalities remain undiscovered.   Alternatively, if He Song could get an Array Skill capable of shielding divine sense, it wouldn’t matter where he lived.   Just that…   After finishing the Array Tao Introduction, He Song had tried to inquire about the follow- up Array Tao Primary Introduction.   But he found out that to continue learning the Array Tao Primary Introduction, he needed to join the Thick Earth Sect.   Or, he could see if someone was selling it and buy it with spirit stones.   With no other option, He Song had to give up on continuing to study array tao and focused most of his attention on cultivating and studying Amulet Tao Introduction instead.   This was why his cultivation level increased so rapidly.   “No problem, friend, I can notify them on your behalf regarding your position as Steward. All you need to do is show your token at any department you want to join. As for the courtyard allocation, you can choose at will,” Wei Fan said when he saw that He Song had no intentions of leaving the Immortal Pavilion. As if he had prepared it earlier, he took out two things from his storage bag.   One was a token.   The other was a map.   “With this token, you can obtain a Steward position in any department you want. It’s up to you where you want to go. ”   “On this map, you can choose any courtyard that is not marked with an ‘X’. However, it’s better to choose one closer to the center, as the spirit Qi concentration will be higher,” Wei Fan advised as he placed both items on the table.   He Song took the token and looked at the map.   After searching for a moment, he chose a secluded courtyard more than three miles away from Master Cheng Shan, located in a rather remote area.   Foundation Establishment cultivators, even those in the early stage, their divine sense covered a range of about two miles.   To avoid living within the range of a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s divine sense, He Song had no choice but to choose a courtyard that was far enough away.   Fortunately, Foundation Establishment cultivators generally didn’t release their divine sense and only did so when they needed to investigate something or during a battle.   Scanning with divine sense consumed divine sense power.   At the same time, the scanned cultivators would feel an extreme resentment toward the R011rcp of the divine sense   In the Cultivation World, scanning others with divine sense was considered taboo..

Chapter 109: Chapter 108: Moving House   Translator: 549690339   No one wants to be unexpectedly scanned by someone’s divine sense.   Once encountering such a situation, most of the time, if there isn’t a significant gap in their cultivation level, the outcome would be life-and-death struggle.   As a Foundation Establishment cultivator and a Master of the Thick Earth Sect, Master Cheng Shan naturally understood this.   Therefore, he wouldn’t casually use his divine sense to probe everything.   Thus, even if He Song chose a courtyard closer to Master Cheng Shan, he didn’t have to worry about his secrets being discovered.   But, just in case, and for the sake of caution, He Song still chose a courtyard that was not within range of Master Cheng Shan’s divine sense.   Only in this way, could He Song’s secret remain safe even if there was a slim chance of its exposure.   He, who was naturally cautious, would naturally make the best choice for himself.   “I’ll choose this one. Although it is on the outer edge, I dislike noise, and this quiet little courtyard is quite suitable for me.”   Pointing to the courtyard he had chosen, He Song spoke while shifting his gaze to the token in his hand.   “As for the token… how about I join the Spirit Construction Pavilion and keep   Wei company?”   Informing Wei Fan of his choice,   He Song casually put away the token and then looked at Wei Fan.   Wei Fan’s previously furrowed brows instantly relaxed, and a trace of a smile appeared on his face. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com  “Would you like to reconsider? The closer you are to the center, the higher the density of the spirit Qi. Although it is quiet there, the spirit Qi density is somewhat lower than at the center.”   Although He Song had already stated that he dislikes noise and thus chose the quiet courtyard,   Wei Fan still wanted to persuade him. The density of spirit Qi, is of utmost importance for cultivators.   In his opinion, the reason He Song gave was not really significant.   If he liked quietness, why not choose neighbors who don’t make noise?   With him as the steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, He Song could choose any of the courtyards on the map as long as he wanted. Unfortunately, he did not know,   He Song’s preference for quietness was just an excuse.   The real reason could not be openly discussed with him.    “No, no, I’ve decided on this one. When I get back, I’ll pack up my things and move to that courtyard. Please make a note of it, Brother Wei.”   Waving his hand to refuse,   He Song quickly spoke again, fearing Wei Fan would continue to persuade him. “As for my position as a steward, let’s settle it at the Spirit Construction Pavilion. With Brother Wei here, I don’t have to worry about losing my position if something comes up.”   Seeing He Song’s determined attitude and his swift change of topic, Wei Fan understood that He Song had made up his mind.   Helpless, he could only nod his head and no longer tried to persuade him.   “Alright, I will report this matter to the Master today. As for the token and the courtyard, my friend, you can arrange everything yourself. It seems that, starting from tomorrow, my friend will be a steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion as well.”   After settling He Song’s courtyard and position, the two quickly parted ways.   Wei Fan needed to report this matter to Master Cheng Shan.   A Qi-refining late-stage cultivator joining the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, especially one with a background in the Immortal Pavilion, naturally required arrangements.   Courtyard, position, all these things needed the Master’s approval before they could proceed.   However, since it was an Immortal Pavilion cultivator who had broken through to the Qi-refining late-stage, there would naturally be no particular scrutiny. On the contrary, Master Cheng Shan would probably only glance at it and then nod his head.   The matter would then be considered successful.   Immortal Pavilion cultivators enjoy better treatment within the Pavilion itself.   However, if a Loose cultivator who had reached the Qi-refining late-stage wanted to join the Immortal Pavilion and become a steward, it wouldn’t be easy.   After parting ways with Wei Fan,   He Song quickly returned to his residence on the outskirts, packing all his belongings into the small cargo storage bag.   At this moment, He Song still had only two storage bags.   One small storage bag with enough internal space for daily necessities.   Another small cargo storage bag containing 66,000 catties of spirit rice and various other trinkets.   Fortunately, the small cargo storage bag’s space was large enough that even with 66,000 catties of spirit rice, it could still accommodate all the things He Song needed to take from his room.   However, the small cargo storage bag was not easy to carry around. After careful consideration, He Song decided that after his next transaction involving spirit rice, he must purchase a larger storage bag that could be carried with him.   This way, in the future, he would not have to carry the inconvenient small cargo storage bag back and forth.   As for now,   the spirit stones on him still had a use, but they were insufficient to buy a large storage bag that could be carried around.   That thing required a thousand spirit stones. If He Song bought the large storage bag, he would have no spirit stones to exchange for middle-grade Artifacts.    For the sake of his own safety, for the time being, he would just carry it like this.   It wouldn’t be too late to make the switch when he sold spirit rice again in the future.   Soon, after careful identification, He Song arrived at his new residence.   This place was located in the inner circle of the Immortal Pavilion.   However, it was situated at the outer edge of the inner circle, more than three miles from where Master Cheng Shan resided.   It was adjacent to the First District on the outer edge of the Immortal Pavilion,   separated only by a Darner.   The spirit Qi here was richer, and the environment was much better.   There were trees surrounding the small courtyard, hiding it behind them and making it rather concealed.   In addition, the nearest courtyard was more than a hundred meters away, making the area calm and peaceful.   Gazing at the trees around the small courtyard, a look of satisfaction appeared in He Song’s eyes.   As expected, it was exactly the same as the map he had seen in the Spirit Construction Pavilion.   A single-family dwelling hidden in a grove of trees like this would have been called a separate villa in his previous life.   Even more so, when He Song stepped into the courtyard, the view suddenly brightened.   There were artificial mountains and flowing water in the courtyard, and a small area had been cultivated into farmland.   There was also a two-story building.   He Song was no stranger to such a two-story building, as he had stayed at Wei Fan’s house for some time.   However, he didn’t know if his courtyard would be arranged the same way as Wei Fan’s home.   Entering the building,   He Song quickly examined the entire building.   There was one master bedroom, two secondary bedrooms, one servant’s room, and a total of four livable rooms.   Additionally, there was a reception hall, two Cultivation Quiet Rooms, one study, one kitchen, and one Training Room.   After the tour, He Song shook his head in speechless amazement.   As he had expected,   He had overestimated the Spirit Construction Pavilion of this world. The layout of the courtyard he had chosen was similar to that of Wei Fan’s home.   There were only a few minor differences, but they didn’t affect the living conditions.   It could be said that all the courtyards in the inner circle of the Immortal Pavilion were virtually identical.   Whether it was the room distribution inside the houses or the arrangement of the artificial mountains and flowing water in the courtyards, they were almost identical..

Chapter 110: Chapter 109: Artifacts Pavilion   Translator: 549690339   The spiritual Qi concentration here was also similar to where Wei Fan lived. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎  It made He Song feel as if he had returned to Wei Fan’s house as a guest.   Fortunately, that feeling was just an illusion.   After He Song moved all his belongings into his new residence, he made some minor changes to the house.   Soon, the entire small courtyard was refreshed, and compared to before, it had gained a trace of earthly warmth.   It was now noticeably different from Wei Fan’s courtyard.   “In the future, I will probably live here for a long time, so I need to prepare for safety measures.”   He secretly thought about digging a hole under the courtyard in the future.   But soon, He Song shook his head.   He decided to wait until he returned from the Green Wall Immortal City before digging the hole.   He would leave for Green Wall Immortal City tomorrow. If he started digging now, he couldn’t dig too deep.   Instead, it would be better to wait until he came back and then start digging.   By then, he could design a deeper hole than the one outside the Immortal Pavilion.   If something went wrong, he could hide underground.   Now, the most important thing was to go to the Artifacts Pavilion to exchange the two lower-grade artifacts on his body—one for attack and one for defense—to two middle-grade artifacts.   With two middle-grade artifacts on his body, along with some spirit amulets, there would be no mistakes in this trip to the Green Wall Immortal City.   After taking out all his belongings and putting them in his new home, with only spirit rice left in his cargo storage bag, He Song stepped out of the courtyard and headed towards the Artifacts Pavilion.   The Artifacts Pavilion was located on the outer perimeter of the Immortal Pavilion.   Rather than that,   Most shops that sell items to the public are located on the outer perimeter of the Immortal Pavilion.   Barely any Qi Refining Late Stage cultivators, their maidservants, attendants, or friends were allowed in the inner circle of the Immortal Pavilion.   For ordinary loose cultivators, entering the inner circle was not easy.   So, shops like the Artifacts Pavilion, which conducted transactions with the public, were generally found on the outer perimeter of the Immortal Pavilion.   He Song arrived at the Artifacts Pavilion along the way.    “Mr. He…. Sir He, congratulations on your great progress in cultivation. Your Foundation Establishment is imminent. Please take a seat.”   As soon as He Song stepped into the Artifacts Pavilion, a figure appeared next to him.   At first, this person naturally addressed He Song as Mr. He when he saw that an acquaintance had come.   But halfway through his greeting, a flash of insight caught his eye and he quickly corrected himself, changing from calling He Song, Mr. He, to Sir He.   To his surprise, He Song, who had been at the sixth-tier Qi Refining stage two years ago, had successfully advanced to the seventh-tier Qi Refining stage and was now a Qi-refining late stage cultivator.   The gap between the Qi-refining mid stage and the Qi-refining late stage was enormous in terms of cultivation and status.   so,   The person who had been calling He Song “Mr. He” quickly changed his tone and respectfully invited him once he realized that He Song had broken through to the Qi-refining late stage.   He Song recognized this person.   His name was Lv Yang, and his cultivation level was the same as He Song’s before—sixth- tier Qi Refining. He was the manager of the Artifacts Pavilion.   Two years ago, when He Song had an abundance of spirit stones, he came here to buy two lower-grade artifacts—one for attack and one for defense—and was received by Lv Yang.   Naturally, Lv Yang was the first to greet He Song when he arrived this time.   However, he couldn’t believe it.   In just two short years, He Song, who could only afford two lower-grade artifacts, had broken through to the seventh-tier Qi Refining stage. The envy in Lv Yang’s gaze was so intense that it was almost overflowing.   Qi Refining Late Stage, eh?   Its status and position were beyond comparison to that of a cultivator who had been stuck at the Qi Refining Mid Stage for a long time but hadn’t yet broken through.   As far as he knew, He Song’s age wasn’t too high.   Such a young cultivator who had broken through to the Qi Refining Late Stage would certainly attempt Foundation Establishment before the age of sixty.   If unsuccessful, a Qi Refining Ninth Stage cultivation would still be enough for He Song to live an unimaginably happy life for the rest of his days.   If successful…   “Well, bring me some middle-grade artifacts. The lower-grade artifacts I have on hand are not enough. I need to change them.”   Following Lv Yang’s invitation, He Song came to the VIP lounge where Lv Yang respectfully served tea. He Song then stated his request.   As for Lv Yang, He Song barely knew him—they had just met once and been served by him once.   The two of them weren’t really familiar with each other, they only knew of each other.   As such, He Song didn’t have any intention of making small talk with Lv Yang. Instead, he just wanted to get his business done as quickly as possible, adjust his state, and be ready to set off for Green Wall Immortal City tomorrow morning.   “Please wait a moment, sir. I will go get them right away.”    As He Song instructed, Lv Yang didn’t dare to slack off.   After pouring a cup of tea for He Song, Lv Yang respectfully responded and then turned to leave.   However, soon after his departure, a beautiful young girl entered the VIP Lounge and offered He Song a refill on his tea.   During this time, she inquired softly with apprehension, fearing that something might go wrong.   Seeing this situation, He Song was taken aback but didn’t object.   He couldn’t help but sigh inwardly at the same time.   When he was at the Qi Refining Early Stage, he didn’t even dare to enter the Artifacts Pavilion’s door.   At that time, he only dared to go to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to buy some basic skills and look at some books on cultivation knowledge.   When he was at the Qi Refining Mid Stage, he also spent a significant amount of time not setting foot in the Artifacts Pavilion.   Even when going to the Spirit Skill Pavilion, he had to carefully weigh the amount of spirit stones he had on him.   Moreover, despite getting to know Ping’er, a steward of the Spirit Skill Pavilion, he never enjoyed the service of the girls in the VIP room.   However,   When he arrived at the Artifact Pavilion during the Qi Refining Sixth Stage to buy two lower-grade artifacts—one for attack and one for defense—the treatment he received was completely different.   At that point, Lv Yang simply walked away while He Song had to wait for his return.   But when he entered the Qi Refining Late Stage,   Although he had just broken through to the seventh-tier Qi Refining stage,   The moment he entered the Artifacts Pavilion, he was greeted by Lv Yang’s respectful smile.   After that, he was invited directly into the VIP lounge without any questions asked.   At the same time, he didn’t forget to arrange for the beautiful girl to serve tea and water to He Song during their waiting time.   The difference in treatment made He Song realize the connection between cultivation and status.   It also made him realize that,   As long as his cultivation improved, anything that he couldn’t enjoy before would become available to him.   At the same time, it made him understand one thing.   As long as he lived long enough and his cultivation was high enough, he could continue to enjoy a beautiful life that ordinary people could only dream of.   “This kind of longevity is what our generations should pursue.” He let out a sigh in his heart, and He Song suddenly felt refreshed.   His cultivation had reached the Qi Refining Late Stage.   At least in this small Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, with his current cultivation, he was definitely among the very few people at the top of the pyramid.   As such, besides being careful in his daily life, he should try to make his life a little better too.   A Qi Refining Late Stage cultivator,   Would it be too much to ask for a slightly better life?

Chapter 111: Chapter 110: Medium Quality Artifacts   Translator: 549690339   At least, he wouldn’t be living like a miserable ascetic as he had in the past anymore.   He should be enjoying life.   Otherwise, his long journey of immortality cultivation would be a tremendous challenge to his state of mind, if he remained a mere ascetic.   With these thoughts in mind, He Song looked thoughtfully at the maiden beside him.   He shook his head.   He would make plans after he got back from Green Wall Immortal City.   Soon after.   Lv Yang appeared in the VIP room.   Gesturing for the maiden to leave, Lv Yang promptly brought out a variety of artifacts, all arranged in front of He Song.   “Sir, this is the mid-quality artifact, the Red Gold Sword, forged from Red Spirit Gold Mine and various precious materials. In terms of power, it ranks highly among mid-quality artifacts, valued at six hundred spirit stones.”   “This is the Eight-sided Sword, a mid-quality artifact, forged from a combination of various ores. It has a tough body, and its power isn’t bad either, valued at four hundred and fifty spirit stones.”   “This is the Dark Jade Knife, a mid-quality artifact. The knife body is crafted from Dark Crystal Stone, it’s extremely sharp and carries great power among middle-quality artifacts, but it has some minor wear and tear, valued at five hundred spirit stones.”   “This is the Ink Iron Shield, a mid-quality artifact, forged from ink iron spirit mines and a variety of precious materials. It is incredibly robust, and when consecrated, it can offer full defense from all sides under the operation of the spirit power, valued at five hundred and fifty spirit stones.”   disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, its defensive power is remarkable. It’s the last piece available in the shop. Sir, if you want it, it’s yours for five hundred spirit stones.”   “This is the Guardian Iron Armor, a medium-quality artifact…”   With Lv Yang’s introduction of each piece, He Song began to understand the qualities of these artifacts before him.   Among the offensive artifacts, there were the most swords, followed by knives.   Among the defense artifacts, there were the most shields, followed by armor.   He Song focused on one offensive and one defensive artifact, preferably a sword and a shield.   He planned to use the Object Controlling Skills to wield the Mana Sword to kill the enemy.   At the same time, he would use the Object Controlling Skills to manipulate the shield for defense.   With these, he would be impermeable to any attack, whether on offensive or defensive, he would be in an optimal position.   He Song picked up a sword from the table and carefully examined it in his hand.    It was the Red Gold Sword.   Forged from the Red Spirit Gold Mine along with other materials, the price was slightly high, costing a total of six hundred spirit stones.   But as He Song held it in his hand and expelled his spirit power into it,   Instantly.   A red glow moved about the VIP room.   The Red Gold Sword, as the name suggests, was covered in red. When it moved through the air, it looked as if it was carrying a band of fiery light around it, endowing it with great power.   The Red Spirit Gold Mine was famous for its red spirit Qi. The red spirit Qi it contained could increase the attack strength of cultivators and was considered superior material for crafting artifacts.   The Red Gold Sword, forged from the Red Spirit Gold Mine and other precious materials, though it was just a mid-quality artifact, it was among the finest of its kind.   No wonder it was more expensive than standard artifacts.   Returning the Mana Sword, He Song put it aside and shifted his attention to the Thick Earth Shield.   Reaching out to take the Thick Earth Shield.   Applying the Object Controlling Skills, his spirit power surged out from his body and the Thick Earth Shield abruptly floated in mid-air.   At the same time, as soon as He Song thought about it, the Thick Earth Shield could appear in any position around his body with incredible speed.   If anyone attempted to attack him, he would only need to react and use the Thick Earth Shield to block the attack. After a round of testing,   He Song nodded in satisfaction.   Immediately, he compared the Thick Earth Shield with other defensive artifacts.   Then the Red Gold Sword with other types of mana swords.   Finally, after much deliberation, He Song decided to purchase the Thick Earth Shield and the Red Gold Sword.   “I’ll take this Red Gold Sword and the Thick Earth Shield. I’ll offset the payment with the two low-quality artifacts that I bought here before.”   Pulling out the two low-quality artifacts, one for offense and one for defense, that he had prepared earlier, He Song stated.   The two previous low-quality artifacts on him had outlived their usefulness to He Song now.   It would be better to return these to the Artifacts Pavilion to reduce the cost of the two mid-quality artifacts he was about to buy. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com  “One Red Gold Sword and one Thick Earth Shield amount to one thousand one hundred spirit stones.”   “Minus the two low-quality artifacts you have, two hundred and thirty spirit stones.”   “Sir, it would only cost eight hundred and seventy spirit stones.”   Lv Yang had calculated the price.    Naturally, He Song was not opposed. With a wave of his hand, there were eight hundred and seventy spirit stones on the table.   The hundreds of shiny spirit stones piled together brightened up the entire VIP room a bit.   Seeing He Song had already presented the spirit stones, Lv Yang was delighted and proceeded to collect the eight hundred and seventy spirit stones into his storage bag.   As a manager of the Artifacts Pavilion, he was rewarded with spirit stones for every artifact he sold.   Though the amount wasn’t large, the accumulated income in a year was not insignificant.   Seeing He Song nonchalantly paying eight hundred and seventy spirit stones, Lv Yang couldn’t help but feel delighted.   At the same time, he was also filled with admiration.   There was indeed a difference being at the Qi-refining late stage.   When He Song was at the Qi-refining mid stage, he only had the heart to buy two low-quality artifacts, spending slightly more than two hundred spirit stones in total.   But now.   Having just broken through and needing to replace his artifacts, he purchased two mid-quality artifacts directly, spending nearly a thousand spirit stones, without even blinking an eye.   This was simply… extravagant!   Spending more than a thousand spirit stones to buy two mid-quality artifacts, although he used two low-quality artifacts to offset some of the price, he still had to fork out eight hundred and seventy spirit stones.   Such an amount of spirit stones was quite a fortune to him, a sixth-tier Qi Refining manager of the Artifacts Pavilion.   It would take him ten years to save up so many spirit stones.   Having purchased two mid-quality artifacts, one for offense and one for defense, and greatly bolstering his combat capabilities,   He Song left the Artifacts Pavilion satisfied.   Behind him, Lv Yang was also smiling as he respectfully saw He Song off.   Both parties were pleased with the transaction.   However.   After leaving the Artifacts Pavilion, He Song quickly turned his attention elsewhere.   Spirit Amulet Pavilion.   They specialized in spirit amulets for sale.   Unlike He Song, the individual amulet Tao master, the Spirit Amulet Pavilion sold spirit amulets of various stages, all guaranteed in quality.   Low-quality spirit amulets, mid -quality spirit amulets, high-quality spirit amulets, Life-saving Spirit Amulet; they had it all.   When buying spirit amulets here, one didn’t need to worry about encountering inferior quality or any other quality issues.   Because each amulet for sale would go through a round of tests, and only after being confirmed as being without flaws would it be put up for sale.   When He Song was unable to set up a stall in the Stall Section, he would sometimes sell his hand-painted amulets at a slightly cheaper price to the Spirit Amulet Pavilion to earn some income.   However, selling spirit amulets at the Spirit Amulet Pavilion could fetch a slightly lower price, which would affect the amulet Tao master’s profit..

Chapter 112: Chapter 111: Spirit Amulet Pavilion   Translator: 549690339   Therefore, only when he really cant get away, He Song would have his spirit amulets delivered to the Spirit Amulet Pavilion for sale.   If he has spare time, He Song would sell the spirit amulets himself at a higher price than at the Spirit Amulet Pavilion.   However, even though He Song was an amulet Tao master now, he didnt have much confidence in successfully creating high-quality spirit amulets.   Given the urgency and the need for high-quality spirit amulets and life-saving spirit amulets for his cultivation journey, it was natural to go directly to the Spirit Amulet Pavilion for purchase.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com   The Spirit Amulet Pavilion was not far from the Artifacts Pavilion.   So, after leaving the Artifacts Pavilion, He Song quickly arrived at the Spirit Amulet Pavilion.   As soon as he stepped into the Spirit Amulet Pavilion, a voice reached He Songs ears.   Its been a while, Yueer here congratulates Sir on the significant progress in cultivation, successfully breaking through to the seventh-tier of Qi Refining, you are now on your way to Foundation Establishment.   At the same time, a petite figure also appeared next to He Song and bowed respectfully towards him.   This was a beautiful young girl named Su Yue, who was at the sixth-tier of Qi   Refining.   She was one of the managers of the Spirit Amulet Pavilion.   When He Song used to come to the Spirit Amulet Pavilion to sell his spirit amulets, he would sometimes interact with her.   They could be considered acquaintances.   It was just a stroke of luck. Friend Su Yue is not old, it wont be long until you break through to the late stage of Qi Refining.   Towards Su Yue, He Song didnt put on any airs, but encouraged her modestly. Not because she was a woman.   It was because, Su Yue was indeed not old, but she had already reached the sixth-tier of Qi Refining.   In a few years, Su Yues cultivation might break through to the late stage of Qi Refining, and she even had the potential to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm in the future.   He Song naturally wouldnt neglect a person who had a chance of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Even if the probability was quite small.   However, He Song was not stingy when it came to a mere gesture.   Sir He Song is flattering me. With my modest aptitude, it might take a long time, said Su Yue as she led He Song to the VIP room while modestly playing down her abilities.   To this, He Song didnt pay much mind.   He also didnt respond.   Not until they entered the VIP room and Su Yue personally brewed a pot of tea for him.   After He Song took a sip of the tea and felt a slight improvement in his cultivation, ne noaaed In satlsractlon ancl tnen spoke up.   Friend Su Yue, today I need to buy some high-quality spirit amulets, as well as some life-saving spirit amulets. Can you please bring some over for me to choose from?    Having spent more than twenty years in Immortal Pavilion, He Song was fully aware of the ins and outs of this place.   Ordinary customers would be served directly in the hall.   The tea offered to them would also be of ordinary quality.   Only when ones cultivation reached the late stage of Qi Refining, or when they needed to purchase goods worth over a hundred spirit stones, would one be invited into the VIP room.   In the VIP room, the tea served was naturally Green Immortal Spirit Tea.   This tea had the effect of improving ones cultivation.   Although not a lot.   However, a small pot required ten spirit stones and was very expensive.   It was especially meant for entertaining important guests.   And the Pavilion didnt need to use much each time, it was merely a gesture.   He Song now had this tea as part of his regular provisions at home; having a cup in his free time could help increase his cultivation slightly.   Please wait for a moment, Sir He Song. Ill go and get them now. After excusing herself, Su Yues figure soon disappeared from the VIP room.   Just as He Song had expected.   Soon, another beautiful young girl entered the VIP room, taking over Su Yues duty of pouring tea.   However, this new girl had only first-tier Qi Refining.   He Song merely glanced at her, then continued to sit quietly, waiting.   He didnt have to wait long.   Soon.   By the time He Song had finished two cups of tea, Su Yues figure appeared once again in the VIP room.   After dismissing the other girl, Su Yue then placed a bunch of spirit amulets in front of He Song.bender   She then softly explained,   Sir He Song, this is a high -quality Thick Earth Amulet, it can withstand several strikes from a practitioner at the late stage of Qi Refining. It costs eighty spirit stones each.   This is a high-quality Golden Light Amulet, it can deliver an attack equivalent to a late-stage Qi-refining practitioner. It costs eighty spirit stones each.   This is a high-quality Divine Movement Amulet, it can greatly enhance the users speed. It costs eighty spirit stones each.   This is a high-quality Earth Tunneling Amulet, it can instantly tunnel you ten miles away. It costs two hundred spirit stones each.   This is a high-quality Flying Amulet, it can allow rapid flight up to ten miles away. It costs two hundred spirit stones each.   This is a high-quality   As Su Yue explained, He Songs gaze went over each spirit amulet in front of him, a sense of helplessness flashed in his heart.   Indeed.   Being an amulet Tao master was economically demanding.    A high-quality spirit amulet costs eighty spirit stones.   A high-quality Life-saving Spirit Amulet costs two hundred spirit stones.   With such prices, the profit margin was already insignificant. Compared to refining elixirs and artifacts, or even beast taming and Array Skills, amulet Tao masters made a difficult living.   Just look at array tao, He Song was just at the entry level and he was already earning over two thousand spirit stones annually.   If he could find a few more places suitable for establishing a spirit field, his income might even increase.   But what about amulet tao masters?   Constantly struggling with creating spirit amulets, if the success rate doesnt reach half, theyre bound to lose money.   Yet they had to keep trying.   If they didnt, the success rate wouldnt get better.   If the success rate did not improve, they wouldnt be able to gain more spirit stones.   So they found themselves stuck in a vicious cycle as amulet tao masters. Even though it seemed that they earned a fair amount, the majority of their earnings had to be invested in creating more advanced spirit amulets.   This was quite a glamorous but also extremely time-consuming and resource-draining profession.   Every day spent creating spirit amulets was time taken away from cultivation.   With less cultivation time, their progress naturally slowed down.   This was a common problem among most amulet Tao masters; their cultivation speed always slower than regular cultivators.   It was like exchanging their cultivation for spirit stones.   Fortunately, He Song didnt rely on being an amulet Tao master to obtain spirit stones.   Amulet Taoist.   It was just his public identity.   Just a cover he used to justify his wealth in spirit stones.   And it was just that right now he could not get the Array Tao Primary Introduction.   Otherwise, he was unlikely to spend a lot of time delving into this discipline. It wasnt necessary, and the drawbacks outweighed the benefits.   With a sigh in his eyes, He Song did a quick calculation in his heart and swiftly decided what he wanted to purchase.   Ill take two high-quality Earth Tunneling Amulets and four high-quality Thick Earth Amulets.    Speaking, He Song then pulled out a bunch of middle-quality spirit amulets from his storage bag.   These middle-quality spirit amulets were previously purchased here for self-defense.   But now that his cultivation had reached the late stage of Qi Refining, these middle-quality spirit amulets were of no use to him anymore.   Check these middle-quality spirit amulets, see how many spirit stones they can offset. If its not enough, Ill pay in more spirit stones.   Pushing the middle-quality spirit amulets to Su Yue, He Song picked up his tea cup for another sip.   This stack of middle-quality spirit amulets was of quite a high value since He Song had not used any of them after buying them.   Seeing this, Su Yue promptly began tallying them up..

Chapter 113: Chapter 112: Departure   Translator: 549690339   Quickly.   Su Yueqing finished counting.   Her crisp voice then rang in He Songs ears.   There are a total of fifteen mid-quality spirit amulets here. Since you purchased them from the Spirit Amulet Pavilion, there is no depreciation. Calculated at twenty spirit stones per piece, they can be offset against three hundred spirit stones.   Two high-quality Earth Tunneling Amulets and four high-quality Thick Earth Amulets. Together, they total seven hundred and twenty spirit stones.   Subtracting three hundred spirit stones, you only need to pay four hundred and twenty spirit stones.   She places the two high-quality Earth Tunneling Amulets and four high-quality Thick Earth Amulets in front of He Song as she casually collects all the mid-quality spirit amulets given by He Song.   Seeing this, He Song waved his hand, and four hundred and twenty spirit stones appeared on the table. Money exchanged on one hand.   Goods on the other.   When Su Yue had put away the spirit stones, He Song also put the six high-quality spirit amulets on the table into his storage bag.   Six high-quality spirit amulets.   Among them, four are high-quality Thick Earth Amulets, used specifically for self-protection.   The other two are high-quality Earth Tunneling Amulets for use in emergencies.   Its not that He Song didnt want to buy more, but this time he had spent eight hundred and seventy spirit stones at the Artifacts Pavilion, plus four hundred and twenty spirit stones at the Spirit Amulet Pavilion.   In a very short time, He Song had spent a total of one thousand two hundred and ninety spirit stones.   Without offsetting with his mid-quality spirit amulets and low-quality artifacts, the spirit stones he originally had would not even be enough to pay the bill.   At this moment.   After spending one thousand two hundred and ninety spirit stones, He Song only has more than two hundred spirit stones left.   These more than two hundred spirit stones are set aside specifically for purchasing spirit amulet materials in the future.   The transaction ends.   Money and goods exchanged.   Under Su Yues watery gaze, He Song quickly left the Spirit Amulet Pavilion.   In the Spirit Amulet Pavilion.   Watching He Songs figure recede, Su Yue sighed lightly, a wistful expression on her face.   Alas, when can I break through to the Qi-refining late stage? Although there looks to be only one word difference between the Qi-refining mid and late stages, in reality, theres a huge gap in status and identity. He Song was unaware of Su Yues sigh in the Spirit Amulet Pavilion.   After leaving the Spirit Amulet Pavilion.    He Song went straight back to his new home.   In the time that followed, he placed the high-quality Thick Earth Amulets somewhere within his easy reach.bender   With a single thought, he could instantly activate the high-quality Thick Earth Amulet to protect himself.   At the same time, the high-quality Earth Tunneling Amulet was also put somewhere easily accessible.   As soon as he sensed something amiss, he could use the Earth Tunneling Amulet to escape to a place ten miles away in the blink of an eye.   This way, his safety naturally surged.   P.pi   He Song immediately refined the Red Gold Sword and Thick Earth Shield that he had just bought.   Artifacts needed to be refined, or recognized as the users own, leaving a unique mark in the artifact.   After refining, only the user can wield the artifact.   Even if the artifact is taken by others, they would not be able to use it after its been refined.   Unless the user dies or deliberately erases the mark themselves, the mark produced by refining will not disappear and holding it in ones hand will not serve any purpose.   Just like before when He Song bought the artifact, he had already erased his mark from those low-grade artifacts so he could sell them.   After refining.   He Song continued to familiarize himself with his newly-purchased pair of mid-quality artifacts one offensive and one defensive.   Once refined, artifacts still required familiarization.   Familiarizing oneself with the operation of an artifact and strategies to handle enemies is a necessary thing.   Of course, when using a sword-type artifact, learning a set of Sword Formulas to manipulate mana swords will make them more powerful in combat.   If no Sword Formulas are learned, the power of the mana sword will be slightly less when wielded in combat, but since its a mid-quality artifact, the difference wont be much.   Defensive artifacts are not so troublesome, they just need to be manipulated to block attacks and dont pose much difficulty.   During these four years, He Song had learned a set of mid-quality Sword Formulas.   This set of Sword Formulas, named the Sun Sword Formulas, carries a sense of unyielding resolve.   Once executed, its very powerful but provides no defensive capabilities.   Fortunately, He Song has high-quality Thick Earth Amulets and mid -quality defensive artifacts, so he does not need to worry about his own defense, making the Sun Sword Formulas a good choice.   Therefore, when familiarizing himself with the Red Gold Sword, it didnt look too bad when he demonstrated the mid-quality Sword Formulas.   Quickly.   A day and a night passed in the blink of an eye.   At dawn the next day.    He Song arrived at the exit of the Immortal Pavilion only to see that Wei Fan was already waiting there early.   Seeing He Songs arrival, Wei Fan nodded at him without speaking and signaled him to follow.   He Song then saw Wei Fans figure darting out at high speed, heading north of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Seeing this.   Without hesitation, He Song executed the Mountain Light Body Skill and closely followed.   When traveling alone.   He Song usually used the Earth Tunneling Skill.   This is much safer.   But he cannot use the Earth Tunneling Skill when traveling with others.   He was prepared for this since the time he mastered the Earth Tunneling Skill.   Therefore.   Before breaking through to the Qi-refining late stage, He Song went to the Spirit Skill Pavilion to buy a mid-ranking skill, Mountain Light Body Skill. By doing so, he could hide the fact that he had already learned the Earth Tunneling Skill.   Hide his strongest skills.   But expose some other skills so that others had no reason for suspicion and treated him as a normal amulet Tao master.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m   In this way, He Song wouldnt draw too much attention, nor would he be too weak and bullied by others.   Appropriate exposure.   At the same time, hide some of your aces. This is true cultivation.   Anyway, Mountain Light Body Skill is very fast, and combined with He Songs cultivation at the Qi-refining late stage, its speed is not slower than Earth Tunneling Skill.   Its just that Mountain Light Body Skill is not as secretive as the Earth Tunneling Skill.   In terms of speed, it is actually on par with Earth Tunneling Skill.   This way, He Song wouldnt fall too far behind Wei Fan.   Soon, a day and half passed like the blink of an eye.   Using the Mountain Light Body Skill, He Song and Wei Fan managed to travel a distance of more than two thousand miles from Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to Green Wall Immortal City within a day and half of arduous trekking.   On the way, due to their cultivation at the Qi-refining late stage, they did not encounter any dangerous situations.   Generally speaking.   A Qi-refining late stage cultivator can move unhindered within Green Wall Immortal City. Basically, no one would dare to provoke them.   But with He Song and Wei Fan, two Qi-refining late stage cultivators traveling together, they were even less likely to encounter any danger.   Strength and cultivation are the pass for everywhere.   If a Qi Refining Early Stage or Qi-refining mid stage cultivator roamed outside, the scene would likely be quite different.   In the Cultivation World, many cultivators could turn into Evil Cultivators at any moment..

Chapter 114: Chapter 113: Master Duan Hun   Translator: 549690339   Even if he turned into an evil cultivator and killed passers-by,   as long as no one discovered him, he could still pretend to be a normal cultivator.   Without danger or difficulty, He Song traversed a vast territory and saw many different sceneries which were completely different from when he was underground.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎   Seeing this, He Song couldnt help but sigh.   If ones strength is sufficient, staying underground all the time is not ideal.   Doing so would make one miss a lot of unique scenery.   After climbing over a high mountain,   He Song faced the mountain breeze and looked towards the distance beyond the mountain.   In an instant, He Song widened his eyes, his gaze firmly locked onto the giant city in the distance.   A giant city!   A real giant city!   Green Wall Immortal City, built entirely of massive green stones, had city walls stretching for countless miles in vibrant green, like a colossal green dragon spanning across all directions.   Green Wall Immortal City, as its name implies, is built entirely of a type of massive green stone, making it incredibly sturdy.   Seeing He Songs astonishment, Wei Fan took the opportunity to explain.   However, even though Wei Fan had been to Green Wall Immortal City many times, he still felt a deep sense of awe every time he looked at the city from afar.   This was the true Immortal City.   The real gathering place for cultivators.   Unlike Immortal Pavilion, which merely served as a trading hub for nearby cultivators.   Lets go; Lao Meng must be anxiously waiting.   After one last glance at the majesty of Green Wall Immortal City from afar, the awe in He Songs eyes quickly faded, and he urged Wei Fan on.   Wei Fan nodded, and the two sped forward, heading towards Green Wall Immortal City.   Cultivators traveled at great speed.   Soon, the two arrived at one of the city gates of Green Wall Immortal City.   After paying a spirit stone as the city entrance fee, He Song finally entered Green Wall Immortal City with Wei Fans guidance.   They didnt linger in the city.   Soon, the two followed the address Meng Guan had given them to find Meng Guans residence in Green Wall Immortal City.   Meng Guans residence was located in the west of the city, a quiet and secluded courtyard.   Unlike the bustling streets nearby, the area around this western courtyard was very peaceful.   There were few cultivators around, but many ordinary people walking back and forth.    He Song was slightly surprised at this, but once he realized that Green Wall Immortal City was a place where both ordinary people and cultivators lived together, he understood.   Cultivators wouldnt personally do every single chore, so it was normal to have some ordinary people serving them.   In this place, ordinary people who had been rarely seen in Immortal Pavilion were numerous.   Together, the two arrived at the entrance of Meng Guans courtyard.   They knocked on the door, and soon, hurried footsteps came from within the courtyard.   Immediately after, an old man with rosy cheeks, white hair, and white eyebrows opened the door, smiling joyously as he invited the two in.   The old man was Meng Guan.   After inviting He Song and Wei Fan into the courtyard, and personally pouring them tea,   Meng Guans joyous expression showed no sign of fading.   Ive been eagerly waiting for my two friends here, waiting day after day and night after night. Finally, youve arrived.   As he spoke, Meng Guan stood up and greeted He Song and Wei Fan with a cupped fist salute.   He Song and Meng Guan hastily returned the gesture.   Then they exchanged pleasantries for a while.   It wasnt until then that Meng Guan talked about his experiences in the past few years with He Song and Wei Fan.   Fourteen years ago.   Meng Guan left the Red Spirit Gold Mine and returned to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, inviting Wei Fan to accompany him to the Green Wall Immortal City to buy Breakthrough Elixirs.bender   Since then, he had broken through to the Qi-refining late stage.   From that moment on, Meng Guan settled in Green Wall Immortal City and began to desperately search for cultivation resources.   However, it proved to be extremely difficult to break through to the ninth-tier Qi Refining in just fourteen years with his Five Spirits Roots aptitude starting at the seventh-tier Qi Refining.   In the beginning, Meng Guan still had some confidence.   But as time went on, after six years, he finally succeeded in breaking through to the eighth-tier of Qi Refining status.   His confidence dissipated more than half as a result.   The reason was simple.   The spirit power required to accumulate in the Qi-refining late stage was just too vast.   Even if he had been desperate enough, taking on various dangerous tasks in Green Wall Immortal City that yielded high returns.   Still, cultivation resources were always in short supply.   The lack of cultivation resources meant that his chances of successfully cultivating to the Qi Refinement Great Perfection Realm before the age of sixty were greatly reduced.   But, having already decided to risk his life for a path forward early on, he knew there was no turning back.   Instead of giving up just like that.   It would be better to keep fighting, even if it meant death in the end, without leaving any regrets.   Therefore, after realizing this, Meng Guan put in even more effort.    Various dangerous tasks in his hands were completed beautifully under his brave, cautious, and not weak abilities.   With the continuous inflow of cultivation resources, his fighting and combat experience had improved tremendously.   Six years, from the seventh-tier Qi Refining to the eighth-tier Qi Refining.   This cultivation speed was already extremely fast.   But it wasnt enough!   If he continued at this speed, Meng Guans chances of cultivating to the Qi Refining Great Perfection before the age of sixty were infinitely close to zero.   However.   Meng Guan did not choose to give up.   Even if he felt that his path was already cut off, and his previous bold words were just an unrealistic dream.   But until the end, until he turned sixty, he would not give up.   As such, he struggled through various dangerous tasks for more than three years.   One day, the news that the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team was recruiting Loose cultivators suddenly spread throughout the entire Immortal City.   Some people thought that too many people had died in the Law Enforcement   Team, and they wanted to recruit Loose cultivators to serve as cannon fodder.   Others felt that the evil cultivators outside the city were becoming too rampant, and the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team wanted to expand its manpower to catch them all at once.   There were even more opinions   However, in Meng Guans eyes at the time, the treatment offered by the Immortal City Law Enforcement Teams recruitment of Loose cultivators was extremely generous.   Once joining the Law Enforcement Team, they would receive a large amount of spirit stone as the monthly payment, from killing Evil Cultivators, and confiscate everything they possessed without the city taking a share.   This generous treatment made Meng Guans heart burn with eagerness, and he signed up at once.   To be able to cultivate to the Qi Refining Great Perfection Realm before the age of sixty, and have the opportunity to step onto the Foundation Establishment Realm.   He was already willing to risk his life for that, so why should he worry about dying?   In addition to the accumulated rich experience and dangers he had encountered for a long time, his fighting and combat experience were extremely rich, and his personal strength was not weak at all.   Joining the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team seemed like an opportunity for him.   With that in mind, Meng Guan resolutely joined the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team and successfully became a member.   By that time, he had been in the eighth-tier of Qi Refining for more than three years, and only a few years were left before he turned sixty.   Perhaps it was because of his wealth of experience accumulated over the previous years.   Perhaps it was due to his unyielding spirit.   Or perhaps, it was because of his courage, cautiousness, and extremely powerful combat prowess.   Meng Guan thrived after joining the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team.   Moreover, since then.   Meng Guan became well-known for his skillful use of the long sword, fighting fearlessly against evil cultivators; his savage and venomous mastery of the Soul-Broken Sword made countless evil cultivators tremble with fear.   The name of Master Duan Hun became louder and louder within Green Wall Immortal City..

Chapter 115: Chapter 114: The Joys of Life   Translator: 549690339   As he killed more and more Evil Cultivators, his cultivation level drastically escalated. He soon broke into the ninth-tier of Qi Refining from the eighth-tier.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m   Then, immediately following his breakthrough into the ninth-tier, he quickly consolidated his spirit power and successfully reached the stage of Qi Refining great perfection.   Up until now.   Meng Guan is preparing to attempt a breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment realm.   The timing is chosen for the month before he turns sixty.   After listening to Meng Guans narration, He Song and Wei Fan exchanged glances, each seeing a trace of astonishment in the others eyes.   This was not how Lao Meng described the situation when he communicated with them earlier!   If He Songs memory served him right,   Meng Guan never mentioned anything like Master Duan Hun in his communication with them.   He also didnt mention slaying Evil Cultivators or what he had experienced over the years.   In his communication with the He Song and Wei Fan through the sound-transmitting paper crane, Meng Guan never mentioned these things.   He would occasionally mention that his cultivation level had progressed.   Not having lived in the Green Wall Immortal City, He Song and Wei Fan naturally didnt know what Meng Guan had given up for these things.   Up until this moment.   It dawned on them just how serious Meng Guan was when he said he was staking his life on his mission.   Looking at Meng Guan, He Song was surprised.   Master Duan Hun.   Qi Refining cultivators with formidable strength are often bestowed the title of Taoist.   After Foundation Establishment, they are referred to as Masters. Although he never heard of this title in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion,   it seemed that Meng Guan, with his own nickname, must have powerful strength acknowledged by many cultivators.   However, despite being shocked by everything Meng Guan had described, He Song still looked somewhat skeptical.   He hadnt investigated Meng Guans situation in the Green Wall Immortal City, having heard of it from the man himself.   Fourteen years.   From seventh-tier Qi Refining to Qi Refining great perfection.   Meng Guans exaggerated cultivation speed and the luck that saw him through numerous near-death experiences compelled He Song to suspect that Meng Guan might be hiding something.   However, after some thought, he decided against probing too deeply into what Meng Guan was hiding.    The Cultivation World.   Everyone has their own secrets.   Since Meng Guan was keeping it hidden, he obviously didnt want others to know.   He might even attract unnecessary trouble if he were to pry too much.   Just like He Song himself, hadnt he also kept secrets, unbeknownst to others?   Thus, after listening to Meng Guans narration, He Song picked up the teacup and said to Meng Guan.   Leaving other matters on the side, allow me to use tea instead of wine today to congratulate Lao Meng on reaching the great perfection Qi Refining and the approaching of his Foundation Establishment. Saying this, He Song finished his tea in one gulp.   On the side,   Wei Fan also hurriedly picked up his teacup on seeing He Song do so.   Yes, I also wish to congratulate Lao Meng on reaching the great perfection Qi   Refining and his imminent Foundation Establishment.    As the two of them finished their tea, Meng Guan also picked up his teacup at this moment, shaking his head with a slight smile.   It was mere luck, just pure luck. Both of you have also made great progress in cultivation. Lets celebrate together, he said.   When the three teacups were put down, the atmosphere in the small courtyard became even warmer.   Three old friends who hadnt seen each other in a long time had gathered today, naturally, there were unending topics to discuss.   Even more so, there were countless sentiments to share.   Although the three hadnt seen each other for more than a decade, there was no sense of unfamiliarity due to their frequent communication, instead, they cherished this hard-earned reunion even more.   Meng Guans invitation to He Song and Wei Fan had an underlying meaning of the last meeting, adding to the warmth of the occasion.   The process of Foundation Establishment was intricate.   While Meng Guan had made a name for himself as Master Duan Hun in the Green Wall Immortal City, he had also offended many people.   With the assistance of two good friends at the Qi-refining late stage, he felt much more at ease.   Although hardly anyone would dare to take actions in the Green Wall Immortal City watched over by several Foundation Establishment masters, its better to be safe than sorry.   If he were attacked during the process of Foundation Establishment, he would probably lose his life and spirit immediately.   Hence, even though he had reached the great perfection of Qi Refining and was on the verge of advancing to the Foundation Establishment Realm, Meng Guan didnt treat He Song and Wei Fan any less seriously.   On the contrary, because of their small circle, he was even closer to He Song and Wei Fan.   After a hearty chat, the three of them settled in Meng Guans small courtyard.   At this moment, its a little over twenty days until Meng Guans sixtieth birthday.   During these twenty-odd days, Meng Guan had to try his best to keep himself at peak condition to ensure a smooth transition to the Foundation Establishment.    At the same time, he had to find a good day to attempt his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment within these more than twenty days.   With the arrivals of He Song and Wei Fan, Meng Guan can finally concentrate on keeping himself at peak condition.   As the days passed one by one.   The time for Meng Guans planned break to Foundation Establishment was getting closer.   As the days passed by, He Song and Wei Fan took turns going out and around Green Wall Immortal City.   They got to know the various distributions and enjoyable locations of Green Wall Immortal City.   Green Wall Immortal City is divided into four regions.   East City, West City, South City, and North City.   These four areas attract four different types of people.   The East City is home to the majority of cultivators who excel in one or other skill. The cultivators living there are generally quite wealthy.   The West City is home to a large number of cultivators or mortals who have complex relationships with the Thick Earth Sect. Meng Guan, being a member of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, lives here.bender   The South City is home to the majority of Loose cultivators who dont possess any additional skills. This place is synonymous with poverty and is the most disorderly and chaotic among the four areas, with a mix of people.   The North City, where the spirit Qi is thin, is largely inhabited by mortals.   These mortals have complex relations with the cultivators in the Immortal City, most of them being descendants of the cultivators.   Due to the different groups living in these four areas of Green Wall Immortal City, people have categorized them using eight words.   East Rich, West Noble, South Poor, and North Humble.   This phrase is easy to understand.   The East City is rich, the West City is noble, the South City is poor, and the North City is populated by mortals, who usually have humble jobs that cultivators are unwillinz to enzaze in, therebv earning it the title of humble.   The small courtyard in the West City where Meng Guan lived was surrounded by numerous other courtyard houses inhabited by people who had intricate relations with the Thick Earth Sect.   There were Law Enforcement Team members.   There were members of Immortal Citys shops.   There were disciples dispatched by the Thick Earth Sect to keep watch.   There were even two Masters at the Foundation Establishment stage from the Thick Earth Sect living here.   After touring the four areas of the city, He Song took a liking to the North City. It was where the mortals lived.   However, it was also the most entertaining part of the Green Wall Immortal City.   Going to brothels, listening to music.   Leaning on the railings and burning incense.   Discussing Dao, paying visits to friends.   All joys of life could be found here..

Chapter 116: Chapter 115: Vein Protection Elixir   Translator: 549690339   Even in the south of the city, the poorest area for cultivators,   He Song had never seen such a scene before.   Being a cultivator was different.   Spiritual Root Possessors were one in a million.   Its impossible for cultivators to make a living by selling their beauty. Although there were female cultivators who specialized in dual cultivation techniques, they made a mutual agreement out of necessity. Unlike the common folks who relied on their beauty for a living.   However,   He Song ceased his wanderings in the north of the city after a few days.   A sudden piece of news made him cast all these thoughts out of his mind.   One day,   A piece of news was making the rounds in Green Wall Immortal City.   A small auction would be held within the Green Wall Immortal City.   In this small auction, many precious items would be auctioned off.   Originally, He Song didnt care, nor did Wei Fan, and Meng Guan didnt even know about it.   Until someone mentioned that a Vein Protection Elixir would appear in this small auction.   He Song and Wei Fan exchanged glances, quickly passed the news to Meng Guan, who was conserving his energy and sharpening his focus in the quiet room.   Upon hearing the news, Meng Guan stepped out of his seclusive cultivation room, climbed up the loft step by step, and sat across from He Song, who was waiting for him, sipping tea.   On the loft, the three of them faced each other, surrounded by the subtle fragrance of tea, filling the entire room with a refreshing aroma.   He Song and Wei Fan had been waiting for a long time.   Now that they saw Meng Guans appearance, they finally felt the worry stone in their hearts has landed.bender   Thank goodness the news arrived in time.   Meng Guan hadnt started his breakthrough yet.   That is to say, Meng Guan still had the opportunity to use the Vein Protection Elixir for his breakthrough.   Instead of having to push through without any elixirs as previously speculated.   In that case, the outcome would be truly uncertain between life and death.   If they can purchase the Vein Protection Elixir in this auction, even if Meng Guan fails to make a breakthrough, he can at least stay alive.    Please, my two friends, help me.   After sitting for a while, Meng Guan stood up and deeply bowed to his two friends in front of him.   He did have a considerable amount of spirit stones on him.   However, knowing the price of the Vein Protection Elixir, he also knew that he didnt have enough spirit stones.   Therefore, asking for help from his two friends might increase the chances of him obtaining the Vein Protection Elixir.   With the Vein Protection Elixir in hand, even if his breakthrough fails, he can still recover within ten years and avoid dying.   Although he had made preparations to risk his life, and had always been implementing them,   who would want to die if they could live?   Even if the road forward had already come to an end, at least he had also tried his best to fight and struggle in the past. Living without regrets can still be a way to live.   With Meng Guans words, the loft filled with the fragrance of tea became as silent as a pin drop.   After a brief quiet,   He Song and Wei Fan exchanged glances, and immediately stood up together and helped Meng Guan up.   Where is Lao Mengs language? Since we have informed you of this news, we will naturally do our best to help.   When they received the news, He Song and Wei Fan had already discussed the matter.   Although they couldnt guarantee that they could help Meng Guan get the Vein Protection Elixir, they would still try their best.   Therefore,   when Meng Guan asked for help, He Song and Wei Fan didnt hesitate at all and agreed to help.   However, He Song felt a bit annoyed in his heart at this moment.   If he had known earlier, he would have sold the spirit rice in his small cargo storage bag.   Most of the more than one thousand spirit stones he had saved up before coming to Green Wall Immortal City had already been spent.   At this moment, He Song only had a little over two hundred spirit stones left.   Although these two hundred spirit stones were He Songs entire fortune, he didnt know if it would be enough.   If it wasnt enough, then he might have to think of other ways.   After being helped up by He Song and Wei Fan, Meng Guan thanked them again with a bow. The three of them sat down once more and began discussing how they could acquire the Vein Protection Elixir.   To my knowledge, the price of a Vein Protection Elixir is usually around two thousand spirit stones,   Meng Guan said the first sentence after sitting down, raising an eyebrow in He Songs heart.   The Vein Protection Elixir is it that cheap?    This was a life-saving pill for a Qi-refining late stage cultivator after failed attempts at Foundation Establishment.   Although it was not as potent as the Foundation Establishment Elixir that could increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment and completely recover within two years, it was able to recover completely within ten years after taking the Vein Protection Elixir even if the Foundation Establishment failed.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m   This was a life-saving pill for a cultivator in the Qi-refining late stage.   Two thousand spirit stones?   Wasnt it too cheap?   It seemed Meng Guan had noticed the surprise in He Songs eyes and paused before explaining.   Although the Vein Protection Elixir can save lives, it is not that precious. It just takes a bit longer to gather all the necessary spirit medicine for a single furnace.    In this auction, there will definitely be more than one Vein Protection Elixir.   With the rarity of items making them valuable, a furnace of Vein Protection Elixirs generally yields five to ten pills. Even if it takes three to five years to produce one furnace, cultivators who need them can still buy them.   After all, cultivators like me who dont have time to wait for the Foundation Establishment Elixir are not common. If they still have time to wait, other cultivators would naturally choose to wait for the Foundation Establishment Elixir.   Upon hearing Meng Guans explanation, He Song suddenly understood.   So thats how it was.   Cultivators like Meng Guan, who had just practiced to the point of Qi Refining great perfection and were already nearing sixty years old, were rare.   For most Qi Refining great perfection cultivators, there was still plenty of time before they reached sixty years old.   With time, they naturally had the opportunity to wait for the appearance of the Foundation Establishment Elixir.   After all, the Foundation Establishment Elixir could increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment.   However, if they took the Vein Protection Elixir first and failed in their Foundation Establishment, they would inevitably miss the peak period of their breakthrough before the age of sixty after the complete recovery of their injuries in ten years.   It took a full ten years for the Vein Protection Elixir to recover ones strength!   Missing the peak period for attempting Foundation Establishment before sixty years old, their success rate would drop significantly even if they tried to break through using the Foundation Establishment Elixir.   so,   it was better to wait for the Foundation Establishment Elixir from the start, then try to fight for it.   When there was really no more time to wait, they could try using the Vein Protection Elixir as a last resort.   With that, He Song finally understood the reason why the price of the Vein   Protection Elixir was so cheap.   Two thousand spirit stones, which He Song could buy with his current income in a year.   With a glimmer in his eye, He Song gazes thoughtfully into the distance, it seems that he can use the Vein Protection Elixir.   Due to the reward from slaying the Evil Cultivator, I still have over a thousand spirit stones on me. If my two friends could lend me some spirit stones, I would be extremely grateful,   Seeing that He Songs doubts were resolved, Meng Guan asked for spirit stones on the side.   He knew the price of the Vein Protection Elixir was only around two thousand spirit stones..

Chapter 117: Chapter 116 Meng Guan s Request   Translator: 549690339   The issue was that when Vein Protection Elixir was available in the past, he was still striving to improve his cultivation, unsure if he could reach the realm of Qi Refining Great Perfection before turning 60.   If he were to use his spirit stones to purchase Vein Protection Elixir back then, it might have slowed down the speed of his cultivation advancement.   Therefore, he had not made preparations in advance.   Otherwise, he wouldnt be stuck in a situation where he just reached the zenith of Qi Refining and had no Vein Protection Elixir at his disposal.   I only left with over two hundred spirit stones. I used up the spirit stones Ive saved before coming here to replace my artifacts and spirit amulets   Upon Meng Guans ask for spirit stones, He Song, after a moment of thought, told the truth.   Though he had more than 60,000 catties of spirit rice on him, he definitely couldnt touch them when in dire need of spirit stones.   If he revealed his identity by selling spirit rice, the consequences would be unpredictable.   Moreover, this is the Green Wall Immortal City, where the control of the Thick Earth Sect is far stronger than that of the Immortal Pavilion.   However, he ruminated on another thought towards the end.   If its not enough, I can sell an artifact. It should be enough to gather the necessary spirit stones.   Even if it meant selling an artifact, spirit rice must remain untapped.   That was a decision made by He Song after careful consideration.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m   Any hasty sell of spirit rice might raise suspicions, leading to severe consequences.   However, if he urgently needed spirit stones and decided to sell an artifact, no one could say anything against it.   Anyway, he traveled to Green Wall Immortal City with Wei Fan and would naturally return to Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion together.   They faced no danger upon their journey here.   He figured there wouldnt be any danger upon their return either.   Worst case, he had two life-saving spirit amulets on himself. If danger arose, he could immediately flee.   After escaping to a distance, he could employ the Earth Tunneling Skill and retreat to Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion while concealing his energy, which wasnt a difficult task.   With this in mind.   Having one more or one less artifact wouldnt affect his safety at all.   This was why He Song preferred to sell artifacts rather than peddle spirit rice in Green Wall Immortal City.   As long as it didnt impact him, there was no harm in helping out a close friend.   At the same time.   Meng Guan, as a guide of his past life, was incredibly important to He Song.   Had it not been for the copy of Spiritual Plant Cultivation Skill that Meng    Guan gave him, He Song would still be struggling through the mortal world.   Perhaps a helpless He Song without the protection of the Pavilion would have perished at the hands of some loose or evil cultivator.   How could he be as comfortable and content as he is now, his cultivation advancing to the Qi-refining late stage in such a short period of time?   With such deep gratitude, He Song naturally needed to reciprocate.   If Meng Guan died because of this incident, He Song might develop a mental demon on his cultivation path in the future, hindering his cultivation.   Rather than being possessed by the mental demon, he might as well use all his capacity to help Meng Guan at this moment.   No matter what, exhausting all resources to help one time could at least pay off some of this immense favor.   Moreover, if Meng Guan successfully established his foundation this time, He Songs assistance would certainly not be forgotten. That way, he might be able to lean on a Master of the Foundation Establishment Realm in the future.   If that time comes, no matter how many spirit stones are needed, it would all be worth it!   Even if Meng Guan failed in his breakthrough.   With the Vein Protection Elixir, he would still be able to survive.   Considering the recompense a Qi Refining perfection cultivator could give for these spirit stones, it was a drop in the ocean.   In that sense, He Song would never be at a loss.   Although he had said so, its unlikely he would have to resort to selling artifacts.   Knowing that the Vein Protection Elixir costs two thousand spirit stones, and Meng Guan already had twelve hundred of them, He Song may not need to provide spirit stones. Wei Fan might be able to cover the remaining spirit stones.   Nevertheless, He Song still had to make his offer.   Without doing so, how could Meng Guan be cognizant of his kind intention?   Only by providing help in a crucial moment can one engrave a deep impression on the others mind.   At this moment, He Song was like adding fuel in snowy weather.   My friend, you worry too much. Over the years, I have saved enough spirit stones, a thousand or so, and theres no need to further discuss the sale of artifacts.    Seeing He Song even willing to discuss selling his artifacts, a flicker of warmth appeared in Wei Fans eyes.   He quickly spoke up about his own savings.   Even though he had a good understanding of He Songs character, hearing that He Song would rather sell his artifacts to help Meng Guan purchase the Vein Protection Elixir made him have an even better impression of He Song.   He Song is so willing to help Meng Guan today.   Who will say he would not do the same for him, Wei Fan, in the future?   As these thoughts crossed his mind, Wei Fan waved his hand casually. A large number of spirit stones were instantly laid out on the table in front of him.   With my thousand spirit stones, plus more than two hundred from Brother He, and the twelve hundred or so on Lao Meng, we should have more than enough to buy a Vein Protection Elixir.   As soon as the words came out, He Song waved his hand from the side, and the remaining two hundred or so spirit stones from his storage bag piled up on the table.   He no longer mentioned selling artifacts.   As he expected, Wei Fan was not lacking spirit stones.    At this moment,   The tea table was filled with spirit stones.   The glowing spirit stones shone, emitting a mesmerizing light.   This scene made Meng Guan, standing by the side, filled with emotion, his face changed.   He looked at He Song and then at Wei Fan.   It was as if he wanted to engrave their faces deeply in his heart.   After a long silence.   He let out a sigh.   He stood up and respectfully saluted He Song and Wei Fan.   It is my good fortune to have friends like you. I will not say much anymore. If I can reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, I will definitely remember your kindness.   The price of a Vein Protection Elixir is usually around two thousand spirit stones.   At this moment, the combined spirit stones of the three were already around two thousand five hundred.   An extra five hundred spirit stones, purchasing a Vein Protection Elixir was now a small matter.   With the strong support from He Song and Wei Fan, Meng Guan naturally felt deeply moved and remembered this moment in his heart.   Seeing this, He Song and Wei Fan quickly helped Meng Guan up and told him not to overthink it.   Right now,   It was still important to buy Vein Protection Elixir at the auction and choose a day to hit the Foundation Establishment Realm. The small auction is to be held in three days time.   Counting the time,   They could still make it.   Thus, after packing up the spirit stones, Meng Guan did not go back to his training room but pleasantly toured the Green Wall Immortal City with He Song and Wei Fan.   For three days, the three of them went around the entire Green Wall Immortal City.   Three late-stage Qi Refining cultivators were touring together, thus naturally, not many people dared to provoke them.   Of course, in these three days, the three of them did not encounter any mishap and everything went well.   Just like that,   Three days later,bender   He Song, Wei Fan, and Meng Guan came to the venue of the small auction together.   As it was a small auction, there werent that many people.   Looking around, He Song saw only dozens of cultivators, with high and low cultivation levels, but not a single Foundation Establishment Master.   However, each participant of this small auction was clad in a black robe and concurrently using the Breath Concealment Formulas, concealing themselves completely.   Even the three of them, did the same.   Meng Guan may have some fame in the Green Wall Immortal City, but the auction prohibited killing and intimidation, with death as punishment for infringement. Naturally, he would not reveal his identity and bring potential troubles upon himself..

Chapter 118: Chapter 117: Protecting the Law   Translator: 549690339   He Song and Wei Fan didnt have their roots in Green Wall Immortal City, so naturally, they followed Meng Guans lead and dressed accordingly.   With that,   Under the condition that no one knew the identity of others, the three of them participated in this small-scale auction together.   However, since the three of them only needed to bid for one Vein Protection Elixir and they had enough spirit stones, there were no major ups and downs during the event.   He Song barely had time to observe the auction scene, listen to Meng Guans bidding, see the auction items come and go on stage, and then the auction ended.   Fast!   Too fast!   While accompanying Meng Guan to pick up the Vein Protection Elixir, He Song felt somewhat dazed.   How is this auctiondifferent from what he had imagined before?   Wasnt it all about threats, provocations, and mentioning who is the son of some Foundation Establishment Clan or the disciple of some Golden Core Sect, and then ending with one party admitting defeat?   Everyone was simply bidding in a peaceful manner and giving up if the price went beyond their expectations.   So quiet.   So harmonious.   It was not like the cruel Cultivation World at all.   A thought flashed through He Songs mind and he couldnt help but look at Meng Guan.   Meng Guans guess was not wrong. This time there were as many as seven Vein Protection Elixirs available.   With a bid of two thousand spirit stones, no one competed with him, and he easily won the elixir.   Perhaps it was for this reason that the small-scale auction ended so hastily.   With this thought in mind, He Song suddenly realized it.   Maybe it was just because there were too many Vein Protection Elixirs available at this small-scale auction that there was no competition for them.   If there were fewer Vein Protection Elixirs, the situation would probably be different.   After paying the spirit stones and taking away the Vein Protection Elixir, the three of them quickly left the auction site.   As three late-stage Qi Refining cultivators traveling together, protecting just one Vein Protection Elixir wouldnt draw others envy.   Even a single late-stage Qi Refining cultivator should be enough to protect one Vein Protection Elixir.   Its just two thousand spirit stones.   A late-stage Qi Refining cultivator can save enough in a few years.   It is unwise to kill a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator just for this handful of spirit stones.   Not to mention, there are three late-stage Qi Refining cultivators.    Therefore,   The three of them quickly returned to Meng Guans home.   Meng Guan bowed to He Song and Wei Fan once more.   Thank you both for your help. I will now retreat to my meditation chamber for seclusion. Please help me guard the place.   After saying that and seeing He Song and Wei Fan nod, Meng Guan finally relaxed and stepped into the meditation chamber.   As the chamber door closed,   He Song and Wei Fan, who were standing outside, exchanged glances, and then went to a spot not too far from the chamber.   They sat down near a table.   As the fragrance of tea began to permeate, Wei Fan spoke on time.   Fellow Daoist, this time Lao Mengs attempt to break through the Foundation Establishment is an opportunity for both of us. If he succeeds, the benefits are obvious, but even if he fails, it can also bring invaluable breakthrough experience for both of us.   In the coming days, both of us need to be vigilant and guard Lao Meng.   Meng Guans attempt to break through the Foundation Establishment was not widely publicized.   According to Meng Guans earlier conversation with the two of them, he had only informed He Song and Wei Fan about it.   Over the past decade or so, he hadnt made any more friends in the vast Green Wall Immortal City.   Although his title as Master Duan Hun had some fame here, he had also offended many people.   To prevent some people from approaching him on purpose, Meng Guan barely had any friends he could talk to in this city, let alone close ones.   He was mostly acquainted with loose cultivators who were equally desperate or cultivators from the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team.   These people,   Naturally, they were not as trustworthy as He Song and Wei Fan.   Dont worry. This is within the Immortal City, and we are in the west side of the city. You should know that there are two Foundation Establishment   Masters stationed in the western part of the city. We just need to be cautious.,   If someone dares to come, all we need to do is make some noise, and help will surely come.    With a casual wave of his hand, a red-glowing mana sword appeared beside He Song.   A mid-grade Artifact.   The Red Gold Sword!   At the same time, an earth-yellow shield began to rotate around He Songs body.   A mid-grade Artifact.   The Thick Earth Shield!   On the side,   Seeing He Song saying that they only needed to be cautious, while already pulling out his artifacts, Wei Fan was left speechless by his friends caution that was apparent in everything he did.   He had forgotten that his own friends cautious nature was ingrained deep into his bones.bender    In such matters, there was no need for him to say anything, as He Song would do it on his own initiative.   After a moment of silence, two mid-grade artifacts appeared beside Wei Fan as well.   With that,   Under the control of He Song and Wei Fan, the four mid-grade artifacts guarded the surroundings vigilantly.   Time passed little by little.   In the blink of an eye, several days had passed.   He Song and Wei Fan remained alert, controlling their own artifacts and staying constantly vigilant.   Inside the meditation chamber,   Meng Guan opened his eyes at this moment.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels   After several days of preparation, he had adjusted himself to his peak state.   His vitality was abundant, his spirit power was full, his mind was refreshed, and his gaze was sharp.   At this moment, Meng Guan, apart from his white hair and eyebrows, had reached the pinnacle in every aspect.   Now, it was time to take the Vein Protection Elixir and start the breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm. With a gentle wave of his hand,   A small jade vial appeared in Meng Guans hand.   He poured out an elixir from it.   Soon, a rich fragrance filled the entire chamber.   Meng Guan felt invigorated upon smelling the aroma.   this elixir was the Vein Protection Elixir that Meng Guan had acquired from the small-scale auction a few days ago.   Now that it has been taken out,   It was time to take it and then begin the breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Determination flashed in his eyes,   Then, he immediately activated his whole bodys spirit power and began his breakthrough attempt into the Foundation Establishment Realm. The key to the breakthrough of the Foundation Establishment Realm, Lies in the compression of spirit power within the body.   Compressing the spirit power, compress after compress, until it reaches its extreme point, forming the first wisp of mana within the body.   Once the Foundation Establishment is achieved!   The mana of the Foundation Establishment Realm is not the same thing as the spirit power of the Qi Refining Realm.   Having mana means that one is a true cultivator.   Whereas the Qi Refining Realm, even experts at the ninth-tier Qi Refining and Qi Refining great perfection, are actually still in between ordinary humans and cultivators, as they only possess spirit power.   Only when one cultivates mana do they begin the path of a true cultivator.   Thats why only those who have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm are called Master (True Person).   In the Qi Refining Realm, even if ones strength is formidable, they can only be called Daoist.   Master is an exclusive title for those in the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Without reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, no one dares to use the title of Master..

Chapter 119: Chapter 118: Foundation Establishment Success   Translator: 549690339   At this moment, outside, He Song and Wei Fan were still being vigilant, but they didnt find anything, and no one came here. Everything was as usual, extremely peaceful.   However, this calm was normal.   Just trying to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, without any heavenly tribulations, the sky would not turn pitch black with thunderclouds.   Before reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, one would not absorb a large amount of the surrounding spirit Qi.   They would only compress the spirit power within their bodies.   Naturally, there would be no commotion.   Only when the breakthrough to Foundation Establishment is successful, and the surrounding spirit Qi begins to be transformed into mana, would some major disturbances occur.   Of course, if there is enough spirit Qi around to absorb, it will not cause a   significant reaction, as long as the spirit Qi can be supplied, it will not generate too much commotion.   It is only when the surrounding spirit Qi is not enough that a vortex will form in mid-air, absorbing all the surrounding spirit Qi. Only then would it create a huge disturbance.   Time passed bit by bit.   In the blink of an eye,   Several days quietly slipped away.   In Meng Guans courtyard, He Song and Wei Fan were still on guard.   Meng Guan was breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in his meditation chamber, and no slack could be allowed.   Therefore, even though many days had passed, they remained vigilant and protected the law as long as Meng Guan didnt leave the meditation chamber.   But one day,   He Song, who was as usual vigilant, suddenly felt the surrounding spirit Qi becoming richer.   After noticing this sudden change, He Songs expression remained unchanged, but his gaze had already turned to the meditation chamber where Meng Guan was in seclusion.   Wei Fan, on the other hand, was also attracted by this sudden change.   Seeing He Songs gaze directed towards the meditation chamber, he couldnt help but look over as well.   It is said that after successfully establishing the foundation, a Foundation Establishment Master will absorb the surrounding spirit Qi to consolidate their cultivation. During this process, if there is enough spirit Qi around, it wont cause too much disturbance.   At this moment, Wei Fans eyes filled with shock, and he softly muttered the news he had once learned.   But if there isnt enough spirit Qi around, a spirit Qi vortex will appear, drawing all the surrounding spirit Qi into the vortex to be absorbed by the Foundation Establishment Master to consolidate their cultivation   As his words fell,            He Song suddenly felt the surrounding spirit Qi becoming even denser.   Being in the room of the small courtyard, with the windows and doors closed, He Song unexpectedly felt a wind blow through.   But He Song knew that it wasnt actual wind.   It was the dense spirit Qi pouring in rapidly from the outside world, creating this illusion for him.   The spirit Qi surged from all directions, causing the spirit Qi in the courtyard to increase sharply. In no time, He Song felt as if he was soaked in a spiritual liquid, and with every breath, he could feel massive amounts of spirit Qi entering his lungs.   However, as the concentration of the surrounding spirit Qi increased rapidly, He Songs face changed and he rushed out of the house, standing directly on the roof.   At the same time, Wei Fans figure also appeared, joining He song, and they stood firmly on the rooftop.   They scanned the surroundings with their eyes, ready to fight at any moment.   Protecting Meng Guan during his breakthrough to the Foundation   Establishment Realm was the current mission of He Song and Wei Fan.   Now, this rich spirit Qi fluctuation would definitely attract many peoples attention.   When else would they go out if not now?   Outside the small courtyard,   A small spirit Qi vortex formed.   Located in Green Wall Immortal City, and situated in the west where spirit Qi was the most abundant, the concentration of spirit Qi in this place was already high.   However, it was still not enough at this moment.   In mid-air, a vortex that wasnt too big appeared, constantly drawing the already dense spirit Qi from the surroundings into Meng Guans courtyard.   The spirit Qi vortex was neither too big nor too small.   Additionally, with the crazy influx of the spirit Qi, the attention of many cultivators was quickly drawn.   Some observed from afar, curious about what happened here.   Others had their faces full of astonishment, hastily distancing themselves from the area.   And there were bolder ones, who quietly approached.   Faced with this situation, He Song and Wei Fan exchanged a glance, immediately bringing out four middle-grade Artifacts to deter their surroundings.   At this moment, besides joy in their eyes, there was still joy.   The appearance of the spirit Qi vortex,   Confirmed to them that Meng Guan had successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage, becoming a true Foundation Establishment Master.bender   As long as he absorbed the spirit Qi to consolidate his cultivation, he would be able to be legitimately called a Foundation Establishment Master.            As Meng Guans good friends, they would naturally receive great benefits in the future.   At this moment, they didnt even mind the malicious individuals who kept approaching.   A Foundation Establishment Master,   Even a newly advanced one,   Wouldnt need their protection.   They only needed to defend Meng Guan before his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment, and help fend off attacks when he absorbed spirit Qi to consolidate his cultivation. That would fulfill their mission.   When Meng Guan had consolidated his cultivation, he would naturally take care of the individuals harboring ill intentions himself.   He Song had witnessed the power of a Foundation Establishment Master once.   Although it was only for a single time,   Core-shifting stage cultivators were slaughtered like cutting melon and chopping vegetables.   Moreover, with the two Qi-refining late stage cultivators, He Song and Wei Fan, blocking the way, delaying the battle would be easy, and members of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team would soon arrive.   By then   Far away,   Some people with nefarious intents, seeing two Qi-refining late-stage cultivators suddenly appear at Meng Guans roof, involuntarily halted their steps.   After pondering for a moment, many retreated and disappeared.   Those opportunists who remained, also vanished upon seeing this situation.   Those who remained glanced around, realizing the situation wasnt feasible, withdrew quickly as well.   With two late-stage Qi-refining cultivators standing guard, the sounds of battle would quickly spread out, and the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team would soon be on their way.   Maybe some Foundation Establishment Masters would take notice of this place as well.   To take action again would be tantamount to suicide.   They sneaked closer, clearly to take advantage of the situation, but they didnt have the intention to commit suicide.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com   Now that they saw the situation wasnt feasible, naturally, they wouldnt stubbornly continue to charge forward.   Thus, a potential great battle disappeared into thin air. He Song and Wei Fan, relieved upon seeing the situation, remained vigilant without letting their guard down, constantly scanning their surroundings to prevent sneak attacks.   However, while He Song and Wei Fan were being cautious,   A group of cultivators suddenly appeared in the distance.   From their clothing, He Song could tell that these people were from the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team.   The group of cultivators came near Meng Guans small courtyard and bowed from a distance before speaking loudly,   Fellow Daoists ahead, we are here under the orders of Master Qingy Yue, to assist you in protecting the law for the Master.   After saying this, the leader of the group waved his hand, and the Law Enforcement Team cultivators that followed stopped, remaining vigilantly at a distance..            

Chapter 120: Chapter 119: Master Duan Hun   Translator: 549690339   Seeing this, He Song slightly raised his eyebrows, but he did not let his guard down.   But in his heart, he was a little shocked.   Master Qing Yue?   Which master is this?   This Master Qing Yue was actually able to mobilize the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team to help protect the law.   Moreover, the news was so well-informed, just as the spirit Qi vortex here had formed, people from the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team had already been sent to help protect the law.   Thank you, fellow daoist, and Master Qing Yue for your help. When my good friend is finished, I will definitely let him know.   He Song, cupping his hands towards the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team in the distance, thanked them and said he will inform his friend about this matter.   As a result, the people of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team in the distance nodded their heads and continued to help guard the surroundings.   With He Songs words, they were at ease.   Master Qing Yue sent them here for a purpose, of course, to show goodwill. With He Songs words, their purpose was naturally achieved.   As time passed.   The spiritual Qi vortex in midair gradually became smaller and smaller.   This meant that Meng Guan had already consolidated his cultivation and completely stabilized it in the Foundation Establishment Early Stage.   Finally, after several days, when the spirit power vortex completely disappeared, a figure appeared beside He Song and Wei Fan.   By then, Meng Guan, who had successfully broken through from the Qi Refining great perfection to the Foundation Establishment Early Stage, no longer looked like an old man, but reverted to a young man.   Breaking through into the Foundation Establishment was a new beginning, so naturally, one should present a new look to others.   Thank you both for protecting the law, and thank you Master Qing Yue, and the Law Enforcement Team members. I have just broken through, and have many worldly matters to attend to. In the future, I will definitely visit you.   Please feel free to leave.   The young Meng Guan first thanked He Song and Wei Fan and then cupped his hands slightly towards the distant Law Enforcement Team members, asking them to leave.   Presumably, he had heard the conversation between those people and He Song beforehand.   After the Law Enforcement Team members and the few onlookers had all left. Meng Guan then pulled He Song and Wei Fans hands together, and they descended from the roof.   Returning to the house inside the courtyard.   Inside the room.   Wei Fan and He Song sat side by side.   Meng Guan was in the upper seat.   For a moment, none of the three spoke, their emotions in turmoil.    Meng Guan need not say, originally he did not hold much hope for his ability to establish a foundation, but now he had stepped into the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was naturally overjoyed.   Wei Fans emotions were equally turbulent. Meng Guans breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm was not just about having an additional powerful support in the form of a Foundation Establishment Master, it could also have a huge impact on his future path towards the Foundation Establishment.   If he could listen to Meng Guans insights about his breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment stage, perhaps his chances of breaking through would soar.   This was the foundation of becoming a Daoist master!   He Songs emotions were no better than those of his two friends.   Although he was different from others and considered the Foundation Establishment to be just a minor obstacle in his life.   However, when his good friend achieves the Foundation Establishment and a living, breathing Foundation Establishment Master sits in front of him.   The oppressive feeling that came from facing a higher order being made him have a deeper understanding of what a Foundation Establishment Master was.   It turns out.   Those who dont step into the Foundation Establishment are ordinary people!   Only by achieving the Foundation Establishment can they truly be called cultivators.   The Qi Refining stage is just a phase that ordinary people must go through to become cultivators.   The three of them looked at each other and were quiet for a long time.   In the end, it was He Song who first calmed down, picking up his teacup and raising it slightly towards Meng Guan.   Congratulations, Lao Meng, on successfully establishing your foundation. From now on, the Immortal Path is within reach!   As He Song spoke.   Beside him, Wei Fan also quickly sobered up, raising his teacup just like He Song.   Congratulations, Lao Meng, on successfully establishing your foundation.   From now on, the Immortal Path is within reach!   As two cups of hot tea appeared in front of Meng Guan, he heard the congratulations of his two friends and slowly breathed a sigh of relief, seemingly coming back to life.   Similarly, holding up his teacup, Meng Guan looked at his two friends in front of him, beaming.   Congratulations to both of you as well. May you both achieve Foundation Establishment in the future.   With that, the three of them picked up their tea cups and drained them in one gulp.   Even after successfully establishing his Foundation, Meng Guan didnt forget the friendship he shared with the three of them.   On the contrary, after breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Stage, a wave of heroism rose in Meng Guans heart when he looked at the two friends with lower cultivation than himself.   Since these two friends had helped him with everything they had to establish his Foundation.   After establishing his Foundation, he must repay their kindness properly. It should be noted that Wei Fans cultivation had alreadv reached the ninth-tier   Qi Refining at this moment, only a few years away from Qi Refining Great Perfection.   Meanwhile, He Song had also broken through to the Qi-refining late stage from being a first-tier Qi Refining cultivator.    These two friends would face the bottleneck of Foundation Establishment in the coming time.   Previously, he didnt have the ability to help them.   Now that he had established his Foundation, he had the ability to help them. Naturally, helping his two and only good friends was just common human decency.   If one or even two more Foundation Establishment cultivators could emerge among these two, he wouldnt be an isolated loner in the future.   Having one or two Foundation Establishment friends by his side, he could face any situation more calmly.   For instance, when Meng Guan was breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Stage, had it not been for his two Qi-refining late stage friends, He Song and Wei Fan, he might have died in the process.   Without He Song and Wei Fan, he probably wouldnt have been able to afford the Vein Protection Elixir.   If he failed the breakthrough, he might have faced certain death.   Having received help from He Song and Wei Fan, Meng Guan naturally understood the benefits of having one or two good friends of the same cultivation realm by his side.   Thus, if he could help raise He Song or Wei Fans cultivation to the Foundation Establishment stage, he wouldnt be alone during his time in the Foundation Establishment Realm.   This was the real reason Meng Guan wanted to help his friends at this moment.   However, as Meng Guan pondered how to help his two friends, Wei Fans voice suddenly rang in his ear.   Lao Meng, have you thought about what dharma title to use? Foundation Establishment masters usually have a dharma title, like Master Cheng Shan of the Immortal Pavilion and Master Qingy Yue who helped us before.   After Meng Guans breakthrough to Foundation Establishment, Wei Fans mind was filled with wild thoughts in addition to his joy.   Suddenly, he remembered the matter of the dharma title and asked Meng Guan if he had decided on one.   Dharma title? When I was in the Qi Refining stage, they called me Taoist Duan Hun. Now that Ive broken through to Foundation Establishment, Ill be known as Master Duan Hun.   Hearing Wei Fans inquiry, Meng Guan thought briefly before deciding to directly inherit the Daoist title from his Qi Refining stage and use it as his dharma title.   Master Duan Hun.bender   This title sounded quite intimidating.   Meng Guan was quite satisfied with this name.   Thus, using Taoist Duan Hun during the Qi Refining stage and Master Duan Hun during the Foundation Establishment stage seemed quite fitting.   Seeing that Meng Guan had decided on his dharma title, He Song quickly nodded after brief consideration.   Indeed, this title was suitable.   However, dharma titles were just trivial matters.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com   The most important thing now was to spread the news so that the newly promoted Foundation Establishment master, Meng Guan, would be brought to the attention of the Thick Earth Sect.   As He Song thought about this, Meng Guans gaze had already turned to the distance.   He sensed a powerful presence approaching and, judging by its trajectory, it seemed to be headed towards him.   Daoist friend Meng, I am Qingy Yue. I apologize for this sudden visit.   Soon, a clear female voice rang outside the courtyard, followed by the appearance of a Qi presence characteristic of someone at the Foundation   Establishment stage..

Chapter 121: Chapter 120: Master   Translator: 549690339   Feeling the cultivation level of the person outside the courtyard entrance, the three people sitting and enjoying tea in the room immediately stood up. Under Meng Guans leadership, they quickly left the room and opened the courtyard gate.   Outside the courtyard gate, a beautiful-looking woman stood quietly.   Behind her, there were two female Qi Refining cultivators, standing on her left and right.   It seemed like she was their leader.   Meng Guan took the lead in paying respects, followed closely by He Song and Wei Fan.   In the face of a Foundation Establishment Master, the necessary respect had to be given.   Although He Song and Wei Fan had Meng Guan, a Foundation Establishment   Master, as their supporter, their own cultivation level was still at the Qi Refining stage.   So naturally, they didnt dare neglect the presence of a Foundation Establishment Master.   However.   When He Song finished paying respects and raised his head, his eyes inadvertently swept over the surroundings, and he was immediately shocked.   Pinger?   Looking at one of the female cultivators behind Master Qingyue, a trace of astonishment flashed across He Songs face.   However, He Song quickly recalled the conversation he had had with Pinger before.   Over a decade ago, after the great calamity at the Immortal Pavilion, he had met with Pinger, who told him that she had escaped the disaster with the help of a benefactor.   It seemed that she had established a connection with a Qi-refining late stage cultivator at that time.   Later, when evil cultivators wreaked havoc outside the Immortal Pavilion and fought the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team, she left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and came to Green Wall Immortal City.   From then on, Pinger often mentioned in her conversations that she had a master.   Even the matter of an Array Tao Genius being directly accepted as an inner disciple of the Thick Earth Sect was something Pinger had heard from her master and then informed He Song.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com   With all this information gathered together and Pinger now standing behind Master Qingyue, He Song almost instantly understood everything.   so.   The so-called master from Pingers mouth was Master Qingyue.   A Foundation Establishment stage female cultivator.   Quickly.   The astonishment in He Songs eves receded.   His expression returned to its usual calmness, as if he hadnt noticed Pinger at all.   On the other side.    As Meng Guan, He Song, and Wei Fan paid their respects, Master Qingyue naturally reciprocated.   Her two female Qi Refining cultivators did the same, as well.   Similar to He Song.   After Pinger finished paying respects and raised her head to look around, she saw He Song standing behind Meng Guan.   For a moment, a look of surprise appeared in Pingers eyes.   He Song?   Why was he here?   And, standing behind a newly ascended Foundation Establishment Master?   Wasnt he supposed to still be at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion? How did he suddenly appear in Green Wall Immortal City?   With surprise in her eyes, Pinger stared at He Song unblinkingly, as if in a trance.bender   It wasnt until her master, Master Qingyue, was invited into Meng Guans small courtyard that she came to her senses and followed.   In the small courtyard.   After everyone was seated, Master Qingyue spoke.   Junior Brother Meng, will you return to the Thick Earth Sect after breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage? As someone who grew up in Thick Earth Mansion, you are part of our Thick Earth Sect. If you decide to return, the sect will naturally treat you as an elder.   In public, she addressed him as a fellow daoist.   In private, she changed her address and called him junior brother.   Without beating around the bush, Master Qingyue was a member of the Thick Earth Sect; a fact that everyone present, except for He Song and Wei Fan, knew very well.   Master Qingyue was one of the Foundation Establishment level masters sent by the Thick Earth Sect to guard the Green Wall Immortal City.   She was a Thick Earth Sect elder and was once a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   Thats precisely why she could directly command the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team to protect Meng Guan.   However, upon hearing her words, He Song and Wei Fan naturally understood her identity as well.   At the same time, addressing Meng Guan as junior brother was her way of trying to close the distance, increasing the probability that Meng Guan would join the Thick Earth Sect.   Master Qingyue, I had already left the Thick Earth Mansion and was sent to   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion. Now, I have become a loose cultivator. How can I bear the title of junior brother from a Master like you?   Seeing this, Meng Guan immediately drew a line between them without hesitation.   Although he indeed came from the Thick Earth Mansion, as Master Qingyue said, his innate talent was too low, and he was soon sent to Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   If it werent for the Red Spirit Gold Mines recruitment of loose cultivators later, he might still be stuck in the sixth-tier Qi Refining stage, unable to progress.   How could he possibly have achieved his current status as a Foundation Establishment cultivator like he is today?   Now, having succeeded in the Foundation Establishment, he had planned to join the Thick Earth Sect.    However.   The conditions he needed had to be fought for.   Otherwise, it would make him seem weak and easily bullied.   As such, a fierce confrontation erupted between Master Qingyue and Meng Guan.   One wanted to gain more benefits.   The other wanted Meng Guan to join the Thick Earth Sect as soon as possible, to prevent other forces from pulling him away.   For a while, neither person stopped arguing, each trying to convince the other.   On one side,   Meng Guan and Master Qingyue were haggling intensely over whether or not to return to the Thick Earth Sect.   Meanwhile, while they haggled, He Song and Pinger faced each other, eyes locked together.   How did you end up here?   Taking advantage of the break in conversation between Master Qingyue and Meng Guan, Pinger lowered her voice and asked He Song.   Just visiting a friends house. Is this the master you mentioned before? He Song, maintaining his composure, asked in a lowered voice as well.   Yes, master said she wanted to take me and my senior sister to expand our horizons, and then we saw you. Is this newly ascended Foundation Establishment cultivator your friend?   Pinger glanced at Master Qingyue, who was still debating with Meng Guan, and couldnt bear to watch.   Was this her usual mature and composed master?   Could it be that she was possessed by something?   Yes, my other friend and I came here to help him establish his foundation. Its truly a joyous event that he has broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage.   Looking at Meng Guan, who was still arguing vehemently, He Song felt that his image of Foundation Establishment Masters collapsed in his mind.   It turned out that when the distance was not so great, Foundation Establishment Masters were not as lofty as he had imagined.   The two Foundation Establishment Masters in front of him, who were passionately engaged in the debate, didnt seem as detached from worldly affairs as he had thought.   Congratulations! With a Foundation Establishment friend, youre bound to establish your own foundation in the future.   At her side, Pingers eyes flashed a hint of surprise, and she immediately congratulated him.   From her perspective, it seemed as if having a Foundation Establishment friend meant He Song would definitely achieve his own Foundation Establishment.   I also congratulate you on becoming a Foundation Establishment cultivators disciple. Youll definitely establish your own foundation in the future as well.   Faced with Pingers congratulations, He Song congratulated her in return without a second thought.   It takes many hands to lift a sedan.   Since Pinger had already congratulated him,   Reciprocating with congratulations was something He Song wouldnt be stingy about.   However, after hearing He Songs congratulations, a look of as it should be appeared on Pingers face..

Chapter 122: Chapter 121: One Person Gains Enlightenment   Translator: 549690339   “Of course, having a Master or a close friend who is a Foundation Establishment Master increases the probability of building the foundation later on compared to regular cultivators.”   This matter-of-fact statement from Ping’er left He Song stunned. What?   Having a Master or close friend who is a Foundation Establishment Master greatly increases the chances of building one’s foundation compared to that of regular cultivators?   Why?   Although He Song, an everlasting being, had never considered foundation-building as his ultimate goal.   For He Song,   Foundation-building had always only been the starting point on his Immortal Path.   However, when Ping’er mentioned it, He Song couldn’t quite believe it.   According to the information He Song had obtained from the Spirit Skill   Pavilion, isn’t it very difficult to become a Foundation Establishment Master?   How come according to Ping’er, as long as one is associated with a Foundation Establishment Master, their chances of building a foundation are much higher than regular cultivators?   If that’s the case, wouldn’t Foundation Establishment Masters be everywhere?   “What do you mean? Is there any secret behind this? Why are Foundation Establishment Masters still so rare?”   Without much thought, He Song directly asked.   Since Ping’er had already mentioned it, it means there is a high probability that this is true.   He just didn’t Imow the reason behind it.   As he spoke, He Song’s gaze swept over Meng Guan and Master Qingy Yue, who were still arguing, a flash of doubt passing through his eyes.   Could it be… the breakthrough experience of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators significantly increases the probability of breaking through the Foundation Establishment Realm?   Or… with the help of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, obtaining the Foundation Establishment Elixir would be much easier?   Or… are there other secrets he’s not aware of?   “You don’t know? Well, it makes sense since your friend only just broke through the Foundation Establishment stage. It’s normal that you don’t know.   Let me tell you, but you must not reveal it.”   Seeing He Song’s confusion, Ping’er quickly reacted after some pondering.   After warning He Song not to reveal it, she quickly retold the story. “Although this information is not disclosed, you’re not an outsider, so I’ll tell you.”    “During the Qi Refining stage, the chances of getting a Foundation Establishment Elixir are very rare. Do you know why? You should know that although the materials for the Foundation Establishment Elixir are precious and difficult to refine, there is still some production within the Golden Elixir Great Sect.”   “However, most of the Foundation Establishment Elixirs are consumed internally. Foundation Establishment Masters who want to train their successors will intercept the Foundation Establishment Elixirs and give them to the younger generation.”   “With the Foundation Establishment Elixir, Qi Refining great perfection cultivators’ chances of building a foundation naturally become much higher than ordinary cultivators.”   “The occasional appearance of Foundation Establishment Elixirs in the city is merely a ploy by the sect to give Loose cultivators a glimmer of hope; the real bulk is in the hands of various Foundation Establishment Masters, used to train the younger generation.”   “Moreover, when training their successors, the Foundation Establishment   Masters usually share their breakthrough experiences with them. With the Foundation Establishment Elixir and the breakthrough experience, their chances of building a foundation are naturally greatly increased.”   “As for why there are so few Foundation Establishment Masters… even with all these, the success rate of cultivators in building foundations has only increased, but it’s still not a guaranteed success.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com  “Those who can truly break through the Foundation Establishment Realm are still very rare.”   “However, compared to loose cultivators, having a Master or a close friend who’s a Foundation Establishment Master makes building a foundation much more likely.”   After listening to Ping’er’s explanation, He Song finally understood.   With the Foundation Establishment Elixir and the breakthrough insights, even cultivators with average talent will have a much higher chance of breaking through compared to ordinary loose cultivators.   Under such circumstances,   It’s quite normal for Ping’er to feel that there’s hope for her foundation-building.   However… isn’t Ping’er a bit too overconfident? According to what she said, He Song thought her breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment stage would be as simple as eating and drinking every day.   “Thank you, Fellow Daoist Ping’er, for clearing up my confusion. I am deeply grateful.”   He Song gave a slight bow to Ping’er, not thinking too much about it. However, a weight was lifted off his heart after learning this piece of information.   If it is true as Ping’er said, the chances of him and Wei Fan breaking through the Foundation Establishment stage will be greatly increased in the future. He himself doesn’t care since building a foundation wouldn’t be able to stop him anyway.   Even without a Foundation Establishment Elixir, all he needs to do is get a Vein Protection Elixir, and he will be able to grind to build his foundation over time using multiple attempts.   A failure means recuperating for ten years.   After ten years, he could attempt to break through again.   He Song doesn’t believe that after dozens, if not hundreds, of attempts, he still won’t be able to break through the Foundation Establishment Realm.   However, Wei Fan is different. He’s a cultivator from the Immortal Pavilion, and his chances of building a foundation are extremely low.   Without a Foundation Establishment Elixir and breakthrough insights, Wei Fan’s chances of breaking through the Foundation Establishment Realm are almost non-existent.   Of course, the same applies to Meng Guan.   However, Meng Guan managed to break through against the odds and successfully entered the Foundation Establishment Realm.   In regards to this, He Song could only attribute it to a stroke of luck.    As for whether Wei Fan would have the same luck, He Song couldn’t be sure.   Therefore, after learning about this, He Song was relieved.   At least, Wei Fan now had a glimmer of hope in building a foundation.   He Song’s gaze subconsciously glanced at Wei Fan, only to see him looking at He Song in astonishment.   At this, He Song gave a smile, then turned to look at Ping’er.   “No worries, if your friend who established a foundation joins the Thick Earth   Sect, you might even have to call me Senior Sister.”   With a wave of her hand, a smile appeared in Ping’er’s eyes as she looked at He Song, her eyes narrowing into crescent shapes, seemingly looking forward to the day when He Song would call her Senior Sister.   However, after hearing Ping’er’s words, He Song was completely puzzled.   Senior Sister?   What Senior Sister?   Ping’er is currently a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   Furthermore, she is a disciple of Master Qingy Yue.   How could He Song, a mere cultivator from the Immortal Pavilion, call her Senior Sister?   Unless…   He Song thought of something and immediately looked at Ping’er in surprise.   “It seems you’ve guessed it. Loose cultivators who establish their foundation and choose to join the Thick Earth Sect can bring others with them.”   “However, one must start as an outer disciple and have at least the cultivation level of Qi-refining late stage, but no more than three people can join.”   “This is what is called ‘when one man achieves enlightenment, all his family and friends are lifted up with him’.”   “As for whether he’s willing to take you two with him into the sect, I don’t know. But since you’re close friends, it shouldn’t be a problem.”   In the face of He Song’s astonishment, Ping’er spoke faintly.   This was the reason she considered He Song not as an outsider and shared this information with him.   Based on her guess, there was a high likelihood that He Song and Wei Fan would be recruited into the Thick Earth Sect.   By that time, He Song would become a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, naturally becoming an insider.   Telling him about these things in advance wouldn’t hurt, as there was no fear of this spreading.   After all, it was easy to imagine how much trust Meng Guan had in He Song and Wei Fan, considering that he asked them to safeguard his breakthrough when he was about to build his foundation.   Now that Meng Guan had become a Foundation Establishment Master, Imowing that he could take others with him into the Thick Earth Sect, he would naturally not abandon He Song and Wei Fan.   With such a connection, the chances of them not being recruited into the Thick Earth Sect are minimal.   It could be said that,   As long as Meng Guan agreed to join the Thick Earth Sect, it would be a done deal for He Song and Wei Fan to become disciples of the Thick Earth Sect..

Chapter 123: Chapter 122: Chickens and Dogs Ascend to Heaven   Translator: 549690339   Only if He Song or Wei Fan refused this opportunity.   But.   Who could refuse the opportunity to join the Houtu Sect within its sphere of influence?   He Song previously hesitated to join the Houtu Sect simply because it would be too eye-catching.   If he could truly join the Houtu Sect without attracting attention and become a disciple, He Song would not refuse.   After all, as long as no one is watching He Song after joining the sect, his secret would not be discovered.   Naturally, he need not worry about everything that would happen after his secret is discovered.   If there is a newly established Foundation-building cultivator who joins the Houtu Sect and incidentally brings two Qi refining late stage cultivators into the sect, all eyes will focus on the new Foundation-building cultivator.   As for those two Qi-refining late stage cultivators?   The Houtu Sect never lacked Qi-refining late stage cultivators.   It is not until they reach Foundation Establishment, that He Song and Wei Fan would even catch anyone’s eye.   Just like Master Qing Yue who was currently discussing with Meng Guan, she never laid her eyes on He Song and Wei Fan from beginning to end.   “Thank you Daoist Ping’er for resolving my doubts, I am deeply grateful. However, joining Houtu Sect cannot be forced upon one; it should be left to fate. ”   He Song thanked Ping’er with a bow.   He had not known all this before.   Originally, he planned to return to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion with Wei Fan after Meng Guan agreed to join the Houtu Sect and left with Master Qing Yue. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com  But now it seemed that he couldn’t go back.   Knowing Meng Guan, he would be more than willing to take He Song and Wei Fan along to join the Houtu Sect.   Thus, his original idea would be completely overturned.   Perhaps when the negotiations between the two are almost settled, and Meng Guan agrees to join the Houtu Sect, it would be time for He Song and Wei Fan to be brought in by Meng Guan too.   Fortunately, most of his belongings were on him, so there was no need to make a special trip back to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion   On one side, He Song and Ping’er were chatting happily because they haven’t seen each other for a long time.   On the other side, the negotiation between Meng Guan and Master Qing Yue was also coming to an end.   “As long as Junior Brother Meng joins, all the conditions I mentioned before will be met, and you can also bring three Qi refining late stage cultivators to join Houtu Sect as outer disciples. I wonder what Junior Brother Meng thinks.” Master Qing Yue looked at He Song and Wei Fan for the first time and spoke.   The conversation between He Song and Ping’er, although not loud, was clearly heard by everyone present.   Although they were surprised that He Song and Ping’er had already known each other, Ping’er had already spoken, and all Master Qing Yue could do was glare at her before putting the matter on the table.   Obviously, this matter could have been used as a bargaining chip.    She deliberately didn’t look at He Song and Wei Fan earlier because she wanted to use this as a last resort.   She didn’t believe He Song and Wei Fan could resist the story of one person achieving success that would elevate everyone close to them.   It was an opportunity to join the Houtu Sect, after all.   In her mind, He Song and Wei Fan would definitely try to persuade her for the sake of their future path.   As such, Meng Guan’s joining the Houtu Sect and taking He Song and Wei Fan with him would have been a foregone conclusion.   However, she didn’t expect her own disciple to blurt out the matter, leaving her no chance to use it as a bargaining chip.   With matters having come to this point, all she could do was glance at her discinlp hefnre IISin? this matter as a condition   It seemed that Ping’er was quite favored, at least she was not punished.   It could also be because Ping’er knew this all along and specially informed He Song.   On the side.   Meng Guan and Wei Fan also heard the conversation between He Song and Pinger very clearly.   At first, they were surprised by He Song’s acquaintance with Ping’er, but when Pinger started talking about some secrets, their attention was instantly drawn away.   Not until just now when Ping’er mentioned the saying that one person’s success could elevate everyone close to them.   Suddenly, their hearts were set ablaze.   One person’s success could elevate everyone close to them.   This sentence struck right into the hearts of both Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   Meng Guan had been thinking about how he could help his two friends and increase their chances of reaching Foundation Establishment.   But he hadn’t expected that a pillow would be provided to him just as he was sleepy.   What could be a better help than bringing his two good friends into the Thick Earth Sect and making them disciples of the Sect?   After becoming disciples of the Thick Earth Sect, they would basically not need to worry about cultivation resources and safety issues.   Moreover, with his assistance as a Foundation Establishment Master, the chances of He Song and Wei Fan reaching Foundation Establishment would likely soar.   If both of them broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, or if one of them did, his life would also be much better in the future. Having a friend at the Foundation Establishment realm by his side would be extremely advantageous.   As for Wei Fan.   Upon hearing this news, he could hardly conceal his excitement.   He was not like He Song, who, upon hearing that he might join the Thick Earth Sect, would definitely consider safety issues first.   Only after ensuring that his safety would not be compromised, would he choose to join the Thick Earth Sect.   But Wei Fan was different.   Like Meng Guan, he had also come from the Thick Earth Mansion.   Where was the Thick Earth Mansion? It was where the Thick Earth Sect trained their outer disciples.   It could be said that from a young age, Wei Fan had always been devoted to the Thick Earth Sect.    Not being able to join the Thick Earth Sect and become an outer disciple was a regret in Wei Fan’s heart.   But now?   The opportunity to join the Thick Earth Sect was right in front of him, so it was no wonder that he was so excited.   However, even so, Wei Fan did not say anything to persuade; instead, he sat quietly in his original spot waiting for Meng Guan’s decision.   Master Qing Yue considered this matter as her final trump card, thinking she had everything figured out.   But she didn’t know that although He Song and the others were good friends, they wouldn’t interfere in each other’s decisions, especially in matters that would affect one another. They would allow the person concerned to make his own decision.   Whether the decision was good or bad, they wouldn’t hold grudges on anything.   As for He Song.   He didn’t really care whether Meng Guan would bring him and Wei Fan into the Thick Earth Sect.   Among the three people present, only he was the most calm.   It was not for any other reason but because he was confident about reaching Foundation Establishment even if he was in the outside world.   Although it might be decades or even centuries before he reached Foundation Establishment, as an everlasting being, he could afford to wait for this period of time.   At present, He Song had no shortage of cultivation resources, and he was fully confident in breaking through to Foundation Establishment.   Besides not being able to continue studying array tao, he didn’t really care whether or not he joined the Thick Earth Sect.   If joining the Thick Earth Sect this time would still attract the attention of countless people, He Song would definitely not join.   Just like he had previously abandoned joining the Thick Earth Sect as an Array Tao Genius.   His secret couldn’t bear to live under the scrutiny of countless people.   Once the secret was discovered, it would be a fatal situation.   However, Pinger had made it clear.   After Meng Guan reached Foundation Establishment, he could bring them both into the Thick Earth Sect. With such conditions, everyone’s attention would naturally be focused on Meng Guan, the newly promoted Foundation Establishment disciple.   The attention directed at He Song and Wei Fan could be said to be very minimal.   In this way, being able to enter the Thick Earth Sect without anyone noticing, He Song would naturally not refuse.   After all, staying within the Thick Earth Sect would always be safer than staying in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Being able to stay in a safer place, He Song would naturally not go to a place full of danger.   At most, he could conceal his Array Tao talent while in the Thick Earth Sect, and as for the rest, revealing a little bit would not matter.   Revealing some secrets was not a big deal; as long as the core secret was not exposed, he would not attract people’s attention.   Without attracting attention, He Song’s secret would naturally not need to be worried about being discovered.   Being in the Thick Earth Sect.   Being an invisible person seemed to be somewhat safer.   At least, it was safer than joining the Thick Earth Sect as an Array Tao Genius, drawing the attention of countless people.   At the same time, revealing some of his trump cards that were not his ultimate moves could also intimidate others, preventing others from taking He Song as weak and easy to bully.   In this way.   Even if he joined the Thick Earth Sect, it would be more advantageous than disadvantageous for He Song..

Chapter 124 - 124: 123: Senior Sister Qingyue Translator: 549690339   As Master Qing Yue’s words fell, Meng Guan meditated for a moment then stood up and bowed slightly to her.   “I am Meng Guan, and I greet my Senior Sister Qing Yue.”   After bargaining with Master Qing Yue earlier, Meng Guan had already managed to secure enough benefits.   Originally, he had been prepared to accept her offer.   But unexpectedly, there was a surprise at the last moment.   Being able to take Wei Fan and He Song into the Thick Earth Sect was something he had never thought of before.   When one man achieves success, his friends and family are lifted up with him.   As it turns out, this saying is indeed true.   As long as they achieve Foundation Establishment, they can bring their close ones into the Thick Earth Sect as well.   Joining the Thick Earth Sect and becoming its disciple is a step to the heaven, isn’t it?   Many loose cultivators and Immortal Pavilion monks in the outside world would be jealous with their eyes turning red, wishing to take their place.   The temptation to join the Thick Earth Sect within its sphere of influence is not something everyone can resist.   A Golden Elixir Great Sect, after all.   Even if they just idled around inside, they could still live leisurely.   “Very well, it’s nice that Junior Brother Meng agrees.”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎   Upon hearing Meng Guan’s address, Master Qing Yue was overjoyed and said ‘yes’ three times.   As Meng Guan agreed to her words, the happiest person was naturally Master Qing Yue herself.   Being able to invite a Loose Cultivation Foundation Establishment into the Thick Earth Sect also had its benefits.   This time, she caught up with Meng Guan, such a loose cultivator, who successfully broke through to Foundation Establishment Realm without any signs beforehand.   Since she lived nearby and was close to the place, she was able to detect the emergence of the spirit Qi whirlpool first, then sent a member of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team to show goodwill.   At the same time, she found out various situations before Meng Guan’s Foundation Establishment and had some understanding of his preferences.   Furthermore, she invited Meng Guan as soon as he successfully exited his closed-door cultivation.   Thus, Meng Guan was finally successfully invited into the Thick Earth Sect.   Once Meng Guan was taken into the Thick Earth Sect, the rewards would be incredibly generous.    Thick Earth Sect.   Although it was a Golden Elixir Great Sect, the Foundation Establishment Masters within its gates were still limited in number.   Adding one more Foundation Establishment Master might not greatly increase their strength, but it would add a bit more depth to their foundation.   “There’s no need to delay, Junior Brother Meng. If you have nothing else to do, let’s set off immediately for the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate, so you can officially join the sect. What do you think?”   In order to avoid slip-ups, Master Qing Yue hurriedly spoke after saying ‘yes’ three times.   She wasn’t worried about anything else; she just didn’t want the credit that she had already secured to be snatched away by someone else.   In Green Wall Immortal City, there were other Foundation Establishment Masters sent by the Thick Earth Sect, not just her alone but also another one.   Meanwhile, there were several other Foundation Establishment Masters in Green Wall Immortal City, but they all came from cultivating immortal families. They might also try to snatch people away.   A newly promoted Foundation Establishment Master was indeed a tempting   target.   If they couldn’t leave quickly, there might be complications.   “That’s fine, but I need to bring my two good friends. The three of us are inseparable, and their contributions to my successful Foundation Establishment can’t be underestimated.”   “Please, Senior Sister Qing Yue, also bring my two good friends into the Thick Earth Sect.”   Master Qing Yue wanted to leave as soon as possible, but Meng Guan nodded and then looked at Wei Fan and He Song.   The friendship between the three of them was still strong.   Before this, they had always supported each other.   Now, with the strong support of He Song and the others, he successfully broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage.   Since they had the opportunity to soar, Meng Guan would naturally not leave them behind.   Moreover, when Master Qing Yue mentioned earlier that he could bring three Qi-refining late-stage cultivators to join the Thick Earth Sect together, Meng Guan had already prepared to bring his two friends along.   Now that he spoke, it was a well-thought-out decision.   On the side.   Hearing Meng Guan’s words, a touch of emotion flashed in Wei Fan’s eyes.   Indeed, he had never misjudged a person.   Whether it was He Song or Meng Guan, they would always help each other as much as they could when faced with situations that could assist the others without harming their own interests.   The mutual support among the three of them enabled them to walk further on the path of immortality.   Perhaps this was the reason they were able to form their small circle in the first place?   With that thought flashing through his mind, Wei Fan’s eyes filled with excitement.    The Thick Earth Sect.   He never thought that one day he would actually join the Thick Earth Sect and become its disciple!   On the other side.   After hearing Meng Guan’s words, He Song was also touched.   Although joining or not joining the Thick Earth Sect didn’t make much difference to him,   he couldn’t put into words the feeling when he found out Meng Guan truly cared for him and Wei Fan.   However, He Song’s emotions quickly calmed down.   As for the reason.   He felt that if one day he himself broke through to Foundation Establishment Realm and faced the choice of bringing three people into the Thick Earth Sect, he would also choose to bring Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   He would make the same choice as Meng Guan did now.   Therefore, knowing that he would make the same choice, his mindset was naturally different.   Helping each other without affecting themselves was the original intention behind the formation of the small circle among the three of them.   “What’s so difficult? I have a low-grade spirit boat that can accommodate more than a dozen people, and we can return to the Thick Earth Sect together.”   “When we get there, the three of you can join the Thick Earth Sect together, making it a delightful event.”   Then,   Master Qing Yue glanced at Meng Guan and his friends, Wei Fan and He Song, with a touch of envy in her eyes.   Such friendship was indeed rare in the cruel world of cultivating immortality.   However, as her gaze swept over He Song, she looked again at Ping’er, who was standing next to her.   Ping’er and He Song knew each other, and their relationship seemed quite good.   Perhaps this was a good thing.   With a thoughtful expression on her face, Master Qing Yue waved her hand.   A small spirit boat flew out of the room, and when it landed in Meng Guan’s courtyard, the spirit boat grew larger in size.   Finally, the originally small spirit boat turned into a small spirit boat that could accommodate more than a dozen people.   “Everyone, get on the spirit boat. We’re heading to the Thick Earth Sect.”   Seeing this, He Song and the others nodded one after another. Following Master Qing Yue’s lead, they jumped onto the spirit boat.   With everyone on board, the spirit boat was lifted into the air under Master Qing Yue’s control and flew quickly towards the northwest direction of Green Wall Immortal City.   The Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate was located in the northwest direction of Green Wall Immortal City.   He Song had seen a map in the Spirit Skill Pavilion, and the Green Wall Immortal City was tens of thousands of miles away from the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   Although they didn’t know how fast the spirit boat was,   He Song calculated that it would take several days to reach their destination..

Chapter 125 - 125: 124: Thick Earth Sect Translator: 549690339   A few days passed in the blink of an eye.   On the spirit boat, He Song became acquainted with Master Qingyue’s other disciple during these few days.   Master Qingyue’s senior disciple was named Chu Shuangshuang.   Chu Shuangshuang was quite beautiful with a petite figure, but for some reason, she always emitted a very clever aura.   As a cultivator, she always exuded a weak and lovable demeanor.   However, while she might seem like an easy target, her actual strength was anything but weak. At this moment, she was at the great perfection stage of Qi Refining, only waiting for the Foundation Establishment Elixir to break through.   When it came to strength, He Song didn’t think he was necessarily her match.   Ping’er’s previous mention of a benefactor helping her was none other than Chu Shuangshuang.   Before the Immortal Pavilion catastrophe, Chu Shuangshuang had been ordered by Master Qingyue to go to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to assist the Immortal Pavilion Law Enforcement Team in blocking evil cultivators and ensuring the safety of the Immortal Pavilion.   At the same time, it also served as a chance for her to gain experience.   Thus, by sheer coincidence, she met Ping’er and helped her avoid the disaster.   After that, Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang became very close.   And Chu Shuangshuang’s status as a disciple of a master made it easy for her good friend Pinger to be directly assigned as the steward of the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   Generally speaking, the steward of the Spirit Skill Pavilion required a cultivator at the late stage of Qi Refining.   However, as a disciple of a master, Chu Shuangshuang only needed a word to allow Ping’er to bypass the cultivation requirements and become the steward of the Spirit Skill Pavilion directly.   In the days that followed,   The battles between the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team and the evil cultivators became more frequent.   Concerned for her friend’s safety, Chu Shuangshuang soon brought Ping’er to Green Wall Immortal City.   Over time, Ping’er was also noticed by Master Qingyue and taken in as a disciple.   Now,   The two, once only acquaintances by coincidence, had become fellow disciples in the same sect.   When He Song first learned of all this, he couldn’t help but be somewhat surprised.   However, after getting to know Chu Shuangshuang through Pinger’s introduction, He Song soon reconciled.    Chu Shuangshuang had a fiery temperament and liked to draw her artifacts at the slightest disagreement.   Although she had a clever-looking aura and a frail figure that could be easily toppled by the wind, her temperament was completely different from her appearance.   As for Ping’er, due to spending most of her time cultivating in quiet places like the Spirit Skill Pavilion, she had an ethereal and serene aura.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com   She would always think thrice before acting on anything.   Being friends with Chu Shuangshuang also meant she could advise her at crucial moments.   It was quite normal for these two people with completely opposite personalities to be friends since they could cover each other’s weaknesses and not cause any trouble when working together.   “The Thick Earth Sect is just ahead,” said the voice on the spirit boat.   On the spirit boat, Master Qingyue opened her eyes and gazed forward, speaking indifferently.   As Master Qingyue’s words fell, everyone on the spirit boat quieted down.   Whether it was Meng Guan, who had just reached Foundation Establishment, or He Song, who was a Qi-refining cultivator, they all looked ahead at this moment.   When the spirit boat flew over a high mountain,   He Song’s eyes were met with towering peaks that pierced the sky, shrouded in wisps of mist, giving them the appearance of a celestial realm.   These peaks were angular and sharp as if carved by a knife, yet at the summit, palace-like buildings were nestled among them.   In addition, below these peaks were smaller ones, where countless buildings were also arranged.   At the foot of the mountains, streams flowed with significant spirit fields embedded in the flat areas.   Crane birds flew through the mountains and valleys; from time to time, cultivators with elegant figures were seen walking along the mountain paths.   He Song looked around and even saw a golden tunneling light streak across the sky.   The golden light came closer and closer.   No, it seemed like it was heading straight for the spirit boat.   He Song became tense, but when he saw Master Qingyue showing no signs of panic, he relaxed and continued to observe the Thick Earth Sect’s scenery.   “Ah, it’s Master Qingyue. I could tell it was you by the spirit boat. Did something haDDen at Green Wall Immortal Citv? Whv did vou suddenlv return   to the sect, Junior Sister?”   Soon, the golden light landed on the spirit boat.   When the light dissipated, a young man appeared.   As soon as he stood firm, He Song heard him ask.   “Greetings, Brother Yuan Shan. Junior Sister returned this time to send Junior    Brother Meng Guan to join the sect. She will return to Green Wall Immortal   City soon, so there is no need to worry.”   Standing up, Master Qingyue slightly bowed to Master Yuan Shan in front of her.   It seemed that the relationship between the two was not very good.   Even in Master Qingyue’s words, there was an implicit hint of seeing someone off.   However, it was unclear whether Master Yuan Shan didn’t understand, or if he understood, but didn’t care.   After hearing these words, his gaze fell on Meng Guan on the spirit boat.   “Oh, are you the new Foundation Establishment cultivator in Green Wall Immortal City?”   Having sized up Meng Guan with a glance, Master Yuan Shan asked despite already knowing the answer.   It was impossible for Thick Earth Sect to be unaware of the sudden emergence of a Foundation Establishment cultivator in Green Wall Immortal City.   However, upon learning that Master Qingyue was bringing the cultivator to the Thick Earth Sect, they didn’t pay much more attention.   It’s just that Master Yuan Shan’s appearance now seemed to indicate that things weren’t that simple.   “I am Meng Guan. If there are no other new Foundation Establishment cultivators in Green Wall Immortal City, then it must be me, ” Meng Guan politely replied to Master Yuan Shan, his face showing no emotion and his words watertight.   But,   Master Qingyue, standing at the side, moved beside Meng Guan at this moment.   “Brother Yuan Shan, junior sister still needs to take Junior Brother Meng to meet the Sect Leader, so I must excuse ourselves. Farewell.”   As she spoke,   Master Qingyue’s fingertips surged with mana, and the spirit boat instantly soared away with everyone on board.   Only Master Yuan Shan’s lonely figure remained in the sky.   Seeing this,   Master Yuan Shan was not angry; instead, he looked profoundly at the departing spirit boat, then turned herself into tunneling light and flew away into the distance.   On the spirit boat,   The atmosphere suddenly became a bit delicate.   Any of the six present who were not blind could see the strangeness of the situation.   However, since Master Qingyue was nearby, it was not a good time to discuss anything in detail, so the atmosphere remained subtle.   But the delicate atmosphere was soon broken by a clear female voice.   “Everyone, try not to think too much. There is just some disconnection between Master Qingyue and Master Yuan Shan. Today, our priority is to have the three of you join the sect as disciples.”   Master Qingyue’s gaze remained fixed on the front, and after briefly explaining, she stopped talking, focusing on controlling the spirit boat’s flight.   Meanwhile, He Song and the others stood behind her with various thoughts. However, since Master Qingyue was just ahead, none of them dared to speak up..

Chapter 126 - 126: 125: Sect Leader Master Translator: 549690339RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com   Silence.   Silence.   He Song stared at his nose with his eyes, and his heart already had some guesses.   It seemed that Master Qingyue and the previous Master Yuan Shan really didn’t get along.   Otherwise, there was no way that Master Qingyue would have directly left with the spirit boat without even finishing his sentences.   However, there was too little information right now, and He Song couldn’t speculate any further.   It was just unexpected.   Just as he stepped into the Thick Earth Sect, there were already small incidents.   “It seems that the Thick Earth Sect is not a paradise on earth either. Now that I have joined it, I should be cautious and careful.”   “As for this matter, I can inquire about it later. The grudges between the Foundation Establishment Masters should have little to do with a Qi-refining cultivator like me.”   He Song took a thoughtful glance at Master Qingyue then lowered his head and stopped thinking about it.   After a long silence.   The spirit boat finally landed outside the gate of the Thick Earth Sect after another tea-time worth of flying.   Inside the gate of the Thick Earth Sect, flying was not allowed. Only outside the gate, one could use tunneling light and spirit boats to fly.   As the spirit boat landed, He Song and the other five people disembarked one by one.   “Ping’er, Shuang’er, take my token and go to the outer Elder. Explain the situation and have these two junior brothers join the Thick Earth Sect. I will go with Meng junior brother to find the Sect Leader first.”   After handing over a token to Chu Shuangshuang, Master Qingyue took the lead and walked ahead.   Before leaving, Meng Guan gave He Song and Wei Fan a reassuring look, then followed.   As a Foundation Establishment Master joining the Thick Earth Sect, it was natural to meet the Sect Leader.   However, it wasn’t that easy for Qi-refining cultivators like He Song and Wei   Fan to meet the Sect Leader.   To join the Thick Earth Sect and become an outer disciple, they only needed to go through a process.   A token of a Foundation Establishment Master, when the reason is given, could be quickly processed.   “Junior Brother He, Junior Brother Wei, please follow us.”   After Master Qingyue and Meng Guan left, Ping’er looked at He Song with a smile on her face, her beautiful eyes sparkling, and she spoke with a chuckle.   It made her quite happy to call He Song a junior brother.   It also made her quite happy to meet an acquaintance in the Thick Earth Sect from the very beginning.   With such combined happiness, it was no wonder that the smile on her face was constant.   “Thank you, both.”   He Song clasped his hands at Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang, not responding to anything else, just expressing his gratitude.   In the past few days, they had become very familiar with each other, and Ping’er had already become close to He Song. Now, He Song knew why Ping’er was so happy.    However, appellations like elder sister and younger brother couldn’t be called casually.   Before becoming a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, he couldn’t call her as she wished.   Seeing this, Pinger didn’t ask for anything else, but continued to smile and led the way, guiding He Song and Wei Fan to meet the outer Elder. With the help of Master Qingyue’s token, He Song and Wei Fan’s names successfully appeared among the Thick Earth Sect’s outer disciples.   With their identities established.   He Song and Wei Fan naturally received the things that every Thick Earth Sect outer disciple has.   An inferior storage bag.   A Sound Transmission Amulet.   Five hundred spirit stones.   Three elixirs.   Twelve packs of Crumbled Jade Powder.   A set of middle-grade mana robes.   A token to activate the Array of a small courtyard.   After receiving everything, the four of them chatted while walking towards the assigned small courtyard.   During the chat, He Song also learned about various information about these items.   The storage bag was a large one, with an inner space at least ten times larger than the small storage bags worth a hundred spirit stones.   However, in the Thick Earth Sect, a large storage bag was not called a large storage bag, just a storage bag.   The storage bag worth a hundred spirit stones was called an inferior storage bag here, with a small inner space and almost no one using it.   Sound Transmission Amulet.   This was a jade piece the size of a cellphone.   The jade piece was covered in patterns, hollow in the middle, and could be opened from within.   After coming into contact with other Sound Transmission Amulets, both parties can communicate through the amulets.   By placing a piece of paper or other items inside the jade block and activating it with a thought, one can send them to another person’s Sound Transmission Amulet.   When the other party opens their amulet and takes out the contents, they can see the writing on the paper or the other items.   However, the Sound Transmission Amulet is small and can only transmit small items.   Moreover, it requires spirit stones to power its usage.   In the outside world, the price of Sound Transmission Amulets is high, mostly used only by Foundation Establishment cultivators.   Qi Refining stage cultivators like He Song in the past could only use the Sound Transmission Skill for communication.   Meanwhile, those five hundred spirit stones, represent the annual salary for an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   The three elixirs are also part of the annual salary.   They are all Qi Condensing Elixirs, high-quality elixirs to be used for   improving one’s cultivation in the Qi Refining late stage.   Twelve packets of Crumbled Jade Powder are also included in the annual salary. It is essential for cultivators practicing the Thick Earth Formulas in the Qi-refining late stage and is required every month.   It can speed up the Qi-refining cultivation rate in the late stage.    Its price is high.   In the outside world, one packet of Crumbled Jade Powder costs a hundred spirit stones and lasts only one month.   It is a product developed by the Thick Earth Sect specifically to earn spirit stones.   As for the mid-grade mana robes, they are standard-issue for Thick Earth Sect outer disciples. Besides indicating one’s identity, they also possess defensive capabilities, making them quite profound.   The small courtyard Array control token is given to every outer disciple.   Using this token, one can activate the Arrays in their courtyard.   Each outer disciple’s courtyard has three Arrays.   The Five Phases Array offers both offense and defense.   The Illusion Array prevents others from peeking in.   The Spirit-Gathering Array gathers spirit Qi for cultivation.   These three arrays are recorded in the introductory part of Array Tao.   He Song had already learned them, but he didn’t expect that learning these three Arrays would be a standard feature in the courtyards of the Thick Earth Sect’s outer disciples.   Upon learning this, He Song fell silent.   Indeed.   Those who aren’t sect disciples can never imagine just how good the treatment of sect disciples is.   Five hundred spirit stones per year.   Three Qi Condensing Elixirs per year.   Twelve packets of Crumbled Jade Powder per year.   Combined, these items amount to an annual expenditure of nearly two thousand spirit stones.   Although the actual cost of the Crumbled Jade Powder and Qi Condensing Elixirs might not be that high, if one were in the outside world, they would still need to purchase them with real spirit stones.   Even considering just the cost price, these items would amount to at least a thousand spirit stones.   Besides this, upon joining, one receives a mid-grade mana robe, Sound Transmission Amulet, and storage bag.   The small courtyard they can casually live in is also equipped with three Arrays.   Only the Thick Earth Sect of the Golden Elixir Great Sect can provide such luxurious cultivation treatment.   Other Foundation Establishment Clans, or minor sects, probably can’t afford to provide such treatment.   However, despite this, although He Song felt amazed, he didn’t feel too much emotional turmoil. These things,   As long as he wanted,   He could have them all.   As an Array Path Master, the speed at which he could earn spirit stones wouldn’t be slower than the Thick Earth Sect disciples, if not even faster.   But now, he was not only in the Thick Earth Sect but also an outer disciple of the Sect.   He was qualified to learn the sect’s skills and Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   By learning more advanced skills and cultivation techniques, the speed at which he could earn resources would be even more terrifying.   Maybe, he could not only enjoy the generous annual salary of a Thick Earth Sect disciple but also use his Array Tao to earn more cultivation resources.   With these combined,   He Song didn’t even know just how horrifying the level of his future cultivation speed would be.   Perhaps, it would be even more horrifying than those outer disciples who lived their lives in the Thick Earth Sect and only needed to cultivate daily, right?

Chapter 127 - 127: 126: Punishing the Evil and Removing the Wicked Translator: 549690339   To earn more spirit stones with the identity of an Array Path Master.   And to receive a generous annual salary with the identity of a Thick Earth Sect outer disciple.   With these steps.   He Song’s spirit stones will definitely keep increasing, and eventually, he might not even need to worry about the price of what he wants to buy.   However, this is just a thought.   In the Cultivation World, many truly good things are priceless.   Either you have to barter.   Or to snatch them by force.   It is not very likely to use spirit stones to buy truly precious items.   Moreover, most of the people who can become outer disciples of the Thick Earth Sect are cultivators with three spirit roots.   The cultivation speed of those with three spirit roots is much faster than that of He Song, who has four spirit roots, and they even have a greater chance of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage.   Although the Thick Earth Sect occupies a vast expanse of land, there are actually not many disciples in the sect when it comes down to it.   Those with three spirit roots are not common.   As for those with even better talent, like Earth Spirit Root and Heavenly Spirit Root, they are even rarer.   Furthermore, if an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect does not break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm by the age of sixty, they will be sent out of the sect.   From then on, their annual salary will change.   This has led to the constant shortage of outer disciples in the Thick Earth Sect.   He Song and the other three walked out from the residence of the outer Elder, and they didn’t see many people as they went all the way to He Song’s courtyard.   In the courtyards they passed by, there were also very few mars with activated arrays.   The small courtyards of the outer disciples of the Thick Earth Sect.   They are filled with an extremely rich spirit Qi, which is much stronger compared to the courtyard that He Song had just obtained in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   After inviting the others into his courtyard for a chat, Wei Fan, Ping’er, and Chu Shuangshuang stayed for a while before each of them went back to their own places.    Their residences were not far from He Song’s place, but not close either.   Occasionally visiting each other was still possible.   After sending away the other three, He Song turned back into his courtyard and activated the array.   In an instant, a mist enveloped He Song’s courtyard.   At the same time, He Song felt an invisible force protecting the entire courtyard.   The Illusion Array and the Five Phases Array had been activated.   Seeing this, He Song finally felt relieved, and he casually found a chair in the courtyard to sit down.   Then, He Song took out his small cargo storage bag and the original inferior storage bag from his body, transferring all the items from these two storage bags into the new one.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com   After doing all of this, He Song thought for a moment and decided to keep the small cargo storage bag and the original inferior storage bag in his sleeves.   These items might come in handy in the future.   Having played with the Sound Transmission Amulet issued by the Thick Earth Sect for a while, He Song finally let out a soft breath.   Various ideas flashed through his mind.   “After becoming an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, I can choose one of the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth for free, along with two skills and a cultivation skill.”   “For the cultivation skill, my earth attribute spirit root is the best among my four spirit roots, so I don’t need to replace the Thick Earth Formulas.”   “For the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth… I’ll see tomorrow, and if there’s an Array Tao Primary Introduction, I’ll choose that and the Array Tao Introductory Insights.”   “At worst, after I’ve completely learned them, I’ll just say that I’ve been studying for many years and still haven’t made a breakthrough.”   “By then, I might even be able to exchange for an Amulet Tao Introductory Insight. ”   “For the two skills, I’ll choose a powerful Sword Formulas and a fast Light Body Skill.”   “The twenty-acre spirit field near Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion needs to be harvested every year. With a fast Light Body Skill, I can save a lot of time traveling more than ten thousand miles between the two places.”   “Moreover, now that my cultivation base has reached the Qi-refining late stage, I have no shortage of artifacts and spirit amulets, and I am even a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, so I don’t need to use the Earth Tunneling Skill when traveling outside and don’t have to worry about encountering danger.” “If I can’t win a fight, I can at least run away.”   “The Sword Formulas and other skills learned by the disciples of the Thick Earth Sect should be more powerful than those used by ordinary Loose cultivators, right?”   He Song sat in his chair, playing with the Sound Transmission Amulet in his hand, already planning in his heart.   Having just joined the Thick Earth Sect, he was not yet familiar with everything in the sect.   Naturally, he could only rely on the information he had obtained to make plans.    He couldn’t give up on the twenty-acre spirit field near Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   This was He Song’s biggest source of income now.   So, going to harvest once a year became the first thing He Song needed to consider.   A Light Body Skill that was specifically for traveling and extremely fast became He Song’s top choice.   Besides, a powerful Sword Formulas would allow He Song not to worry about his lack of strength while using the Light Body Skill on the ground and being chased down by Evil Cultivators.   With a powerful Sword Formulas at hand, He Song’s combat power, combined with his numerous artifacts, spirit amulets, and mana robes, is now incomparable to before.   If he really encounters Evil Cultivators, it might not be He Song being chased down, but He Song punishing the evil-doers instead.   These two skills are essential.   Array Tao Primary Introduction is also necessary.   However, just as He Song was calculating all of this in his heart and was just beginning to think about how to cultivate so that his cultivation base could grow quickly,   He suddenly noticed that the array covering his courtyard was touched by someone.   Subconsciously, two high-quality Thick Earth Amulets appeared in He Song’s hand, and even the Thick Earth Shield had already appeared beside He Song.   It wasn’t until He Song realized he was in the Thick Earth Sect that the solemnity on his face disappeared.   As an Array Path Master, for a moment, he had forgotten where he was.   He thought he was in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and someone had triggered his array.   As the solemnity on his face disappeared, He Song also put away the high-quality Thick Earth Amulets and Thick Earth Shield in his hands.   After straightening his clothes, He Song then took out his token and waved it casually.   Soon.   The Illusion Array and Five Phases Array enveloping the courtyard dissipated, revealing the scene outside the courtyard.   Outside the courtyard, Meng Guan and Wei Fan were marveling at the scene of the array disappearing before their eyes.   Seeing He Song coming to greet them, the two of them entered the courtyard with He Song.   After seating the two of them in the courtyard, He Song waved his hand and the Illusion Array and Five Phases Array were instantly reactivated, enveloping the entire courtyard once again.   “Mr. He, your ability to manipulate arrays is really fast. When I went back to my courtyard, I didn’t even have time to learn before Lao Meng had already rushed back.”   As he said this, Wei Fan looked at Meng Guan beside him and then shook his head.   Meng Guan went to see the Sect Leader with Master Qingyue, while He Song went with Wei Fan, Ping’er, and Chu Shuangshuang to see the outer Elder.   Although they were handling different matters, the timing was about the same.   So, when Wei Fan sat at He Song’s place for a while and then found his own courtyard, Meng Guan had already found him as well.   Then, the two of them came together to He Song’s place to meet up..

Chapter 128 - 128: 127: The Hidden Secret of the Thick Earth Sect Translator: 549690339   “This isn’t difficult. As long as you have the token, you can manipulate it however you want.”   Hearing Wei Fan’s slightly envious voice, He Song waved his hands repeatedly, attributing everything to the token.   At the same time, he was secretly vigilant in his heart.   In the future, he would probably need to be even more cautious.   Like now, just getting the token and being able to manipulate the Array Skills skillfully is something that must not happen again.   Although it is indeed easy to control the array after obtaining the token, one mustn’t let others find any flaws in it.   This time, it was just Wei Fan casually mentioning it.   But if he didn’t pay attention to these details, one day he would expose himself.   “Alright, now that the three of us have joined the Thick Earth Sect, we’ll take our time to figure things out.”   “However, when I met the Sect Leader Master before, he also gave me some guidance. Now that I’m here, I might as well share some matters with you.”   He shook his head, making He Song and Wei Fan focus their attention on him, and Meng Guan began to speak.   “After becoming an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, if you can’t break through to the Foundation Establishment Stage within sixty years, you’ll be sent to the Immortal City and your annual salary will be reduced. Please remember, my friends.”   “Besides, when selecting cultivation skills, skills, and the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, consult with the elder in charge. You may gain some guidance.”   “The skills and knowledge in the Thick Earth Sect are more complete and powerful than those in the outside world, and even come with annotations from predecessors, making them easier to practice.”   “At the same time, the Thick Earth Sect does not prohibit disciples from going out for training. Even if you haven’t received your annual salary, you can make it up when you return to the mountain.”   “In the Thick Earth Sect, the only thing that matters is cultivation progress, so both of you need to hurry.”   As Meng Guan spoke, he picked up a cup of tea from the table and drank it down.   Seeing that He Song and Wei Fan seemed thoughtful, Meng Guan stopped talking and waited quietly instead.   Before long.   He Song and Wei Fan finally digested the information they had learned from Meng Guan.   Then, the two quickly bowed their hands towards Meng Guan and thanked him.   However, Meng Guan just waved his hand slightly, indicating that he didn’t care.   But just as he was about to speak again, he seemed to suddenly remember something and gave a reminder.   “By the way, if you encounter any Foundation Establishment Masters with the word ‘mountain’ in their dharma title, it’s better to avoid them. It involves some secrets, so I won’t go into details.”            At this, He Song and Wei Fan nodded, even though they didn’t know why.   “Now, let me share with you various insights on breaking through the   Foundation Establishment Realm.”   “If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. After I finish explaining, I need to change my cultivation skills and choose a few Foundation Establishment skills to cultivate. I might have to go into seclusive cultivation for a while.”   As Meng Guan began to speak, He Song and Wei Fan immediately sat upright and began to listen carefully.   Insights from Qi Refining all the way to Foundation Establishment.   For a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator like He Song, it was extremely precious.   If it were in Green Wall Immortal City, a Foundation Establishment Master willing to sell insights on breaking through the Foundation Establishment realm would be immediately sought after by countless people.   Thousands, or even tens of thousands of spirit stones, might not be enough to buy it.   Keep in mind.   The insights on breaking through the Foundation Establishment realm aren’t something that only one person can learn.   This kind of insight can be used as a foundation and heritage, passed down from generation to generation.   How could thousands or tens of thousands of spirit stones compare to such a foundation?   Unfortunately, almost no Foundation Establishment Masters would sell such insights. Even with spirit stones in hand, there was simply no way to find a   buyer.   Insights like these were usually passed down orally, contributing to the rarity of Foundation Establishment Masters.   According to Meng Guan’s description.   To break through from Qi Refining great perfection to the Foundation Establishment Realm, one needs to undergo multiple compressions of spirit power.   One time after another, gradually compressing the originally loose spirit power within the body.   Finally, when the spirit power in the body is compressed to its limit and a trace of mana is successfully born, Foundation Establishment is achieved.   There is also a technique for compressing spirit power in the body.   According to Meng Guan, before compressing spirit power, he would accumulate strength for a while, and when he felt the timing was right, he would give it his all and exert all his pressure.   In this way, the degree of spirit power compression would increase rapidly.   After exerting full pressure, he would stabilize his position while accumulating strength again.   Over and over again, the cycle went on.   After accumulating strength time and time again, he eventually managed to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm by a stroke of luck.   At the same time, he couldn’t help but exclaim.            Without the Foundation Establishment Elixir and insights on breaking through the Foundation Establishment realm, the chances of success were infuriatingly low.   His successful Foundation Establishment was merely a stroke of luck. Had he been careless, he felt he would have failed.   But fortunately, fate favored him. His successful Foundation Establishment changed his and Wei Fan’s destiny as well.   After Meng Guan finished talking about the Foundation Establishment insights, He Song and Wei Fan asked some questions, finally understanding everything.   He had informed them of the insights on breaking through Foundation Establishment.   Next, Meng Guan casually wiped the table in front of him, and two small jade bottles appeared on it.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com   Seeing this, He Song and Wei Fan looked at each other, seeming to guess something.   But they also felt it was unlikely.   While hesitating.   Meng Guan chuckled and spoke up.   “Take these. Thanks to Master Qingy Yue speaking up, the Sect Leader Master was deeply moved by our friendship and granted us two Foundation Establishment Elixirs. One for each of you.”   With that, Meng Guan looked at He Song, a mysterious glint in his eyes.   “Mr. He, if you meet Master Qingy Yue or her two disciples in the future, you must thank them properly.”   The sudden appearance of the Foundation Establishment Elixirs caught He Song off guard.   Foundation Establishment Elixir?   Although he had a hunch when Meng Guan took out the two jade bottles, once Meng Guan admitted that each bottle contained a Foundation Establishment Elixir, He Song couldn’t help but feel a sense of unreality.   Wasn’t it said that…the Foundation Establishment Elixirs were extremely precious?   Wasn’t it said that…for loose cultivators, obtaining a Foundation Establishment Elixir was as difficult as climbing to heaven?   But then again…’   Right! Foundation Establishment Elixirs were indeed precious to loose cultivators, and trying to obtain one was as difficult as climbing to heaven.   But now, both he and his companions were no longer loose cultivators.   Whether it was He Song or Wei Fan, they were now disciples of the Thick Earth Sect.   In the eyes of those in the Thick Earth Sect, the three of them were now considered insiders.   As Meng Guan said, the two Foundation Establishment Elixirs he received were bestowed by the Sect Leader Master.   Sect Leader Master.   Master.   Those who could be called a master were certainly Golden Elixir cultivators.   Moreover, they were Golden Elixir cultivators who controlled the entire Thick Earth Sect.   For such an existence, the two Foundation Establishment Elixirs were not really that valuable.   At the same time, there was also Master Qingy Yue speaking for them..        

Chapter 129 - 129: 128: Foundation Establishment Elixir Translator: 549690339   Upon learning that the three of them had started from humble beginnings and had been helping each other along the way until now, still maintaining a deep friendship, it was not difficult to accept that they were granted two Foundation Establishment Elixirs as a token of appreciation.   What could the thoughts of a Golden Elixir Master be, so that anyone could easily guess?   Moreover, the two of them are already disciples of the Thick Earth Sect right now.   Meng Guan is even an elder of the Thick Earth Sect.   Granting two Foundation Establishment Elixirs would not only benefit sect disciples but would also make Meng Guan, a newly established Foundation, have a strong sense of belonging to the sect. It was simply a win-win deal.   If there were another Foundation Establishment Master among the three… The new Foundation Establishment Master would naturally be wholeheartedly loyal to the Thick Earth Sect.   Thick Earth Sect.   As a Golden Elixir Great Sect, it naturally has its unique aspects.   Otherwise, it would not have been standing tall and growing stronger within the sect.   “Alright, if I encounter Master Qingyue or her two disciples in the future, I will surely express my gratitude to them.”   Nodding his head in agreement, He Song didn’t mind why Meng Guan entrusted this matter to him.   However, he immediately raised a teacup, stood up, and bowed deeply to Meng Guan.   “But before that, I have to thank you first. ”   “That’s right, the greatest credit goes to you.” At once, Wei Fan also stood up with He Song and bowed to Meng Guan in gratitude.   Facing this situation, Meng Guan’s body stiffened slightly, and then a look of helplessness appeared on his face.   Waving his hand, a surge of mana emerged, immediately lifting the two bowing men back to their feet.   Then, Meng Guan pretended to be displeased and said,   “The three of us need not be so formal with each other; without the help of my two friends, how could I, Lao Meng, have come this far in my journey?   “Besides, these two Foundation Establishment Elixirs were granted by the Sect Leader, so the person you should be thanking is him.”   “After you two friends have successfully reached Foundation Establishment and met the Sect Leader, you can thank him in person.”   Saying this, Meng Guan forcefully shoved a jade bottle into the hands of He Song and Wei Fan.   After completing this, a smile finally appeared on Meng Guan’s face.   He then withdrew his mana.   Seeing things develop to this point, He Song and Wei Fan could only accept the elixirs.   “By the way, this Foundation Establishment Elixir can only enhance the probability of Foundation Establishment. If you want a higher success rate, you still need to find more Foundation Establishment Elixirs.”   “You can take up to six Foundation Establishment Elixirs at a time, and the success rate would be greatly increased.”    “You may go ahead and search for them. If you find them, that’s great. If you can’t… after I finish my seclusive cultivation, I can help you out. However, it will depend on your age at that time.”   “If you can’t find any, there’s no harm. With the breakthrough insight I mentioned earlier and this Foundation Establishment Elixir in hand, your chances of successfully breaking through to Foundation Establishment will be much higher.”   Seeing that He Song and Wei Fan had accepted the Foundation Establishment Elixirs, Meng Guan immediately began to give them advice.   He had just learned this information himself.   It was Master Qingyue who had informed him, which allowed him to tell He Song and Wei Fan about it.   When Meng Guan first learned this news, he felt extremely fortunate.   His success in breaking through to Foundation Establishment seemed to be due to sheer luck.   For others attempting to break through to Foundation Establishment, there were numerous difficulties, with countless failures caused by both the   rounaatlon EstaDnsnment Elixirs ana tnelr DreaKtnrougn Insignts.   But what about him? He had nothing. With nothing but passion, he had directly broken through to Foundation Establishment.   However, unlike Meng Guan, there was not much change in He Song’s and Wei Fan’s expressions upon hearing the news.   With a Foundation Establishment Elixir and Meng Guan’s insight into breaking through to Foundation Establishment, their success rate was already many times higher than ordinary loose cultivators.   If they failed, they could only blame it on fate.   Of course, if possible, the two would still try their best to find more Foundation Establishment Elixirs to increase their chances of breaking through.   Afterward, the three of them chatted for a long time in He Song’s small courtyard before they each went their separate ways.   Meng Guan returned to his seclusive cultivation.   Wei Fan went back to his cultivation as well, striving to reach the Qi Refining   Great Perfection and begin his Foundation Establishment as soon as possible.   After Meng Guan and Wei Fan left, He Song once again activated the array inside the small courtyard, enveloping it within.   Only at this moment,   He Song took out the jade bottle containing the Foundation Establishment Elixir.   Upon opening the bottle cap and looking at the Foundation Establishment   Elixir inside the jade bottle, He Song’s eyes filled with deep contemplation. “So this is the Foundation Establishment Elixir…obtained without any effort.”   Putting the jade bottle in his storage bag, He Song sighed inwardly, but no emotionally excited expression appeared on his face.   According to his original plan,   If he could get a Foundation Establishment Elixir, of course, he could use it.   But if he couldn’t get it,   he could still eventually reach Foundation Establishment using only Vein Protection Elixirs and through the passage of time.    Although the process would be time-consuming and exhausting, after all, he was completely different from other cultivators. Even without a Foundation Establishment Elixir, he would definitely be able to achieve Foundation Establishment.   It would only take a longer time.   However, now,   Since the Foundation Establishment Elixir was already in his possession, He Song naturally overturned his original plan.   “Just now, Lao Meng said that you can take up to six Foundation Establishment Elixirs at a time. I have one now, and if I can get a few more, my chances of success will greatly increase,”   “My talent is only in the four spirits rootS. I may not be as good as other outer disciples, so if possible, I need to find some more Foundation Establishment Elixirs and increase the odds of Foundation Establishment to the highest point before proceeding.”   “In this case, if I can establish a foundation in one attempt, it would save a lot of time and avoid arousing the suspicion of others.”   “However… It’s hard to find such Elixirs. I still have time anyway, so I’ll take it slow.”   After safely storing the Foundation Establishment Elixir, He Song pondered for a while and soon began to sit and cultivate.   Unknowingly,   A day and night had quietly passed.   The next morning,   He Song woke up from his meditation, glanced around, and realized that the sun had already risen high above the horizon.   Seeinz this, He Sonz immediatelv zot up, performed a cleansinq technique on himself, and then strode out of the small courtyard, heading straight towards the distance.   He had decided yesterday that today he would seek the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth and learn new skills. As the time had come,   He Song naturally went out to seek them.   Yesterday, He Song had already learned the locations of various places within the Thick Earth Sect from Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang.   Thick Earth Sect,   A Golden Elixir Great Sect.   Within the sect, there were various buildings and mountains for cultivation, book collection, and artifact, and elixirs refining and so on.   What He Song was looking for this time was the Book Collection Pavilion inside the Thick Earth Sect.   The Book Collection Pavilion was divided into three levels.   The first level could be entered by outer disciples.   The second level required Foundation Establishment Masters to enter.   The third level could only be entered with the permission of the Sect Leader.   The books it contained were extensive and varied, countless times more than those in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion’s Spirit Skill Pavilion.   Yesterday, when Chu Shuangshuang mentioned this place, she specially reminded He Song to spend a few more days in the Book Collection Pavilion so he could learn more about the common knowledge of the Cultivation World and so on.   He Song naturally agreed gladly.   “New outer disciple? Go in. One of the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, two skills, and one cultivation skill. You can’t take more than that.”   When He Song arrived at the Book Collection Pavilion, a young man appeared beside him and casually said these words.   However, Meng Guan had mentioned yesterday that when they came to the Book Collection Pavilion to choose cultivation skills and skills, they could inquire more about the guards, and perhaps they could get some pointers..nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Chapter 130: Chapter 129: Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill   Translator: 549690339   Therefore, upon seeing the other party, He Song bowed his hand in salute and then spoke.   “Sir, I am new to this place, and I am not sure how to choose cultivation skills and spells. Could you give me some guidance?”   Being the caretaker of the Book Collection Pavilion.   And being able to appear silently beside him without any detection before speaking.   This person’s cultivation must be higher than his own.   It is not likely to be in the Foundation Establishment Realm, but might be in the Qi Refining great perfection stage.   Thus, calling him a senior is the most normal thing to do.   As He Song spoke, there was a flash of light in his eyes.   He immediately determined the other party’s cultivation level.   This was a cultivator at the Oi Refining great Derfection stage.   However, perhaps he had practiced a skill unique to the Thick Earth Sect which allowed him to move unnoticed.   “Don’t call me sir, I am Song Zhen, merely responsible for external matters, just guarding the first floor of the Book Collection Pavilion. You are a newcomer to the sect, just call me Song Brother.”   Seeing He Song bow to him and referred to him as Sir, Song Zhen’s face stiffened, and he quickly jumped aside to dodge and expound a little.   In the Thick Earth Sect, disciples only need to address each other as brothers and juniors. Even if they meet a Foundation Establishment Master, they only need to call them elders.   He Song’s sudden address as a senior made him feel at a loss.   However, he also noticed He Song’s unfamiliarity with the sect, and so he explained it to him.   After the explanation, he also bowed his hand to He Song.   “Come with me, junior brother. You can tell me what kind of cultivation skills and spells you want to choose. I am very familiar with the Book Collection Pavilion, just tell me what you want, and I can get it for you right away.”   Seeing this, He Song quickly followed along.   Then, he began to discuss his requirements with Song Zhen.   A Light Body Skill with extremely fast speed.   A Sword Formula with great power.   If there is a cultivation skill better than Thick Earth Formulas, then it might be worth trying. If not, never mind.    As for the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, He Song casually said that he has long admired array tao and wants to study it.   Thus.   In a short while, Song Zhen brought back several jade slips.   “This is Mountain Wind Riding Skill. When cast, you can ride the wind at an extremely fast speed. It is one of the top traveling skills for Qi Refining stage. The Light Body Skill you knew before is nothing in comparison.”   Song Zhen handed a jade slip to He Song and explained.   However, noticing the surprise on He Song’s face, he added an explanation.   “This Mountain Wind Riding Skill is a common skill used by outer disciples of our Thick Earth Sect. Some like the Light Body Skill can’t compare with the Wind Riding Skill. The difference between the two is huge, and so is their speed.”   Only after He Song nodded in realization, did Song Zhen pick up another jade slip.   “This is Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill. Its power is immense when cast, and ordinary cultivators have no resistance against it. It is much more powerful than the average Sword Formula.”   “Generally speaking, when using the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill against cultivators who use ordinary Sword Formulas, it only takes a few moves to slay them.”   As if afraid He Song might not believe it, Song Zhen gave a specific example.   As for the ordinary cultivators he mentioned, they were probably loose cultivators or those from the Immortal Pavilion.   Apart from disciples of the Thick Earth Sect, other cultivators could only learn things like Sword Formulas.   Even before today, He Song’s learning had been limited to just one Sword Formula.   “There’s nothing to replace Thick Earth Formulas. Your earth-attribute spirit root is ideal, so just continue cultivating it.”   “This is Array Tao Primary Introduction, you take it and study it as well. However, if you do not have any comprehension after a long time, you can come back and replace it with other Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.”   As he spoke, several jade slips were placed into He Song’s hand by Song Zhen.   Seeing this, He Song thanked Song Zhen first, and then took the jade slips to a quiet room.   Close the door.   Lock it.   Put the jade slips in front of him.   After scanning the jade slips one by one, He Song’s eyes flashed with amazement.   “The Thick Earth Sect, truly worthy of being the Thick Earth Sect, a Golden Core Sect, this is terrifying!”   “I originally thought that Qi Refining stage cultivators were all similar, but I didn’t expect that as soon as I entered the sect, I discovered the huge difference between them.”   “Mountain Pressing Sword Formula? Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill.”   “Mountain Light Body Skill? Mountain Wind Riding Skill.”    “Array Tao Introduction? Array Tao Primary Introduction.”   “Every single one of these is something that one cannot come into contact within the outside world.”   “Some people have said before that Mountain Light Body Skill is the commonly used skill of Thick Earth Sect disciples, but I didn’t expect that although the prefix is the same, the real commonly used skill of Thick Earth Sect disciples is Mountain Wind Riding Skill.”   “Is this the gap between sect disciples and loose cultivators?”   Various thoughts flashed through He Song’s mind, feeling a chill down his spine.   If it weren’t for joining the Thick Earth Sect and having access to these things, he would never have known how great the gap between sect disciples and loose cultivators had become.   Whether it is skills, Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, or cultivation resources.   There is a huge difference between sect disciples and loose cultivators in these aspects.   If he had accidentally offended a sect disciple before…   His fate would have been very miserable.   Because even if a loose cultivator or an Immortal Pavilion cultivator reached the great perfection of Qi Refining and all their skills, artifacts, and spirit amulets were the best choices… ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com  When facing a sect disciple of the same cultivation level, the sect disciple could still have a huge advantage.   Just in terms of skill power…   The Mountain Pressing Sword Formula and the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill have incomparable power.   According to Song Zhen, using the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill against ordinary loose cultivators would place them in a deadly situation within a few moves.   Such a terrifying gap…   And that’s just the difference between a Sword Formula and a Sword Riding Skill.   If other skills were added, the gap might become even wider.   If a conflict does occur between a loose cultivator and a sect disciple, even with the same cultivation level, the one who dies is most likely the loose cultivator. “Fortunately, I am no longer a loose cultivator.”   Holding the jade slip to his forehead, and before receiving the information within it, He Song felt thankful in his heart.   Soon…   Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill.   Array Tao Primary Introduction.   He was able to engrave them all into He Song’s memory, and he could summon them whenever he wanted.   After doing all this, He Song got up and left the quiet room, returned the jade slip, and bid farewell to Song Zhen before quickly returning to his own courtyard.   During the following days…   He Song continuously practiced the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill and the Mountain Wind Riding Skill.   It’s worth mentioning that in both of these skills, there were numerous annotations and they were extremely detailed.   As a result, He Song’s progress in practicing them was rapid..

Chapter 131: Chapter 130: 3 Years   Translator: 549690339   According to He Song’s estimation,   If he was to study these two skills without any annotations, it would take two years for him to master just one skill to the point where he could use it at will without losing any of its power.   However,   It was precisely because of the large number of annotations in the skills that He Song saved a considerable amount of time.   Therefore, he estimated that he would need only two years to fully master both skills to the point where he could use them at will without losing any power.   One year’s time would be enough to master one skill to the point where it could be used at will without losing any power.   After some consideration, He Song still decided to learn the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill first.   It wasn’t because he didn’t want to learn the Mountain Wind Riding Skill first,   It was because,   Every year, He Song had to leave the Thick Earth Sect and travel tens of thousands of miles to the vicinity of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to harvest the twenty acres of spirit fields there.   He Song had to improve his combat power to deal with unknown dangers during this long journey.   And the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill was the best means to improve He Song’s combat power.   As for the Mountain Wind Riding Skill,   Although it could save a lot of travel time, it could be learned later on.   After all, only when you have strong strength can you walk unconfined in the outside world.   If one’s power is weak, and you have to run away from even encountering a loose cultivator, going out is no different than seeking death.   Time flew by,   Years passed like a shuttle.   In no time, He Song had spent nearly three years in the Thick Earth Sect.   During this nearly three-year period, He Song not only mastered the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill to the point where he could use it at will without losing any power,   But he also mastered the Mountain Wind Riding Skill to the point where it could be used at will without losing any power.   As a result, although He Song’s cultivation was still at the seventh-tier of Qi Refining, his combat power had already become incomparable to before.   Now, He Song could even hold his own against an evil cultivator.   The formidable power of the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill greatly boosted He Song’s confidence.   However, He Song was still cautious in his actions.   Thus, during the nearly three years, He Song did not encounter any crises.    At the same time, his understanding of the Array Tao Primary Introduction had also been elevated.   Although he had not yet learned any new array skills, by He Song’s estimation, he would be able to master a new array skill in a few years.   The array skills in the Array Tao Primary Introduction were much more difficult than those in the Array Tao Introduction.   Even with He Song’s diligent research, it would still take a lot of time to master them.   During this nearly three -year period,   He Song traveled annually to the vicinity of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, tens of thousands of miles away, to harvest spirit rice.   He had harvested twice, gaining more than 44,000 catties of spirit rice on his body.   Adding to the original 66,000 catties of spirit rice he already had, there were a total of 110,000 catties of spirit rice on He Song.   With such a large amount of spirit rice, He Song had no choice but to start using the small cargo storage bag again.   The storage bag provided by the Thick Earth Sect did not have enough space.   Fortunately, when He Song had switched storage bags, he did not discard the small cargo storage bag, but kept it.   If not, he would probably have to spend more spirit stones on a new storage bag from the sect.   During these nearly three years,   He Song’s cultivation progress was extremely rapid.   Being in the Thick Earth Sect, which was rich in spiritual energy, and with the sect issuing elixirs, Crumbled Jade Powder, and other resources, He Song would occasionally buy other things that could help him improve his cultivation.   Naturally, during this nearly three-year period, He Song’s cultivation increased at an extremely fast pace,   He had taken a big step forward on the path from the seventh-tier to the eighth-tier of Qi Refining.   Compared with the time when he had just broken through to the seventh tier of Qi Refining, He Song’s body now had a significantly greater amount of spirit power.   As for Wei Fan and Meng Guan,   They spent most of these three years in seclusive cultivation, and He Song only saw them once a year when they took their annual salary, not catching sight of them the rest of the time. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels  As for Master Qing Yue, Ping’er, and Chu Shuangshuang, they had already left the sect three years ago and went to guard the Green Wall Immortal City again.   Master Qing Yue was originally the guardian of Green Wall Immortal City, and when he returned to the sect this time, it was just to bring Meng Guan.   After receiving the reward, they naturally left.   He Song did not even have the chance to express his gratitude in person,   He could only wait to thank them face to face when they meet again by chance in the future.   During these three years,   He Song spent most of his time immersed in learning skills and seclusive cultivation.   He did not pay too much attention to outside matters.    Until today.   “Judging by the time, it’s time to harvest the spirit rice again. This time when I go out, I’ll have to sell all of my spirit rice.”   Glancing his cargo storage bag, He Song thought to himself.   Although he was already a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect,   To avoid revealing that he already had entered the realm of Array Tao, He Song had not yet sold any spirit rice.   As a result, even with 110,000 catties of spirit rice on him, He Song was not yet ready to sell it.   But, times have changed.   Now, the amount of spirit rice on him was getting bigger and bigger.   Having so much spirit rice on hand, it would be better to sell it to exchange for spirit stones.   Perhaps, these spirit stones could be put to other uses.   Glancing at his storage bag, He Song thought of the Foundation Establishment Elixir in it.   If there were Foundation Establishment Elixirs available on the market and he had enough spirit stones on him, it would not be impossible to buy one.   Although it might seem excessive for him, a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, to snatch a chance to establish his foundation from a loose cultivator,   But,   He was spending his own spirit stones on it.   How could this be considered excessive?   Having thought about this, He Song immediately got up, prepared everything for going out, and stepped out of the courtyard.   At the entrance of the Thick Earth Sect,   He Song left the words about leaving the sect for training, and then immediately took to the sky, heading to the far distance.   The Mountain Wind Riding Skill,   Was neither a conventional Light Body Skill nor a Tunneling Skill.   It was a Wind Riding Skill.   With the ability to manipulate wind power, the user could travel swiftly in mid-air.   Just by lightly stepping on the ground, the user could take to the skies, travel a long distance in mid-air, and upon landing, lightly step on the ground again to continue soaring and traveling far.   This process repeated.   This kind of skill that required only a slight force to take hundreds of meters per step in mid-air, while also being able to manipulate wind power to accelerate or turn, was called a Wind Riding Skill. The Mountain Wind Riding Skill was incredibly fast,   Much faster than the Earth Tunneling Skill.   To reach the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion tens of thousands of miles away, the Earth Tunneling Skill would take more than half a month,   However, when using the Mountain Wind Riding Skill, it would only take about seven or eight days.   In this way, a lot of time was saved for traveling.   Now that He Song had strong capabilities and a deep background, he would generally use the Mountain Wind Riding Skill to travel instead of the Earth Tunneling Skill unless he sensed danger ahead..

Chapter 132 - 132: 131: Sudden Change Translator: 549690339   However, even though He Song now had a solid background, his personal strength was not weak either.   But when he used the Mountain Wind Riding Skill, he always kept himself close to the treeline, or sprinted across flat ground.   He hovered above the ground, always no more than a few meters high.   He didn’t move flamboyantly through mid-air.   In this way, he could reduce the chance of being discovered, while also making his advance more covert.   So, in case of any sudden situations, he would have more reaction time.   His form threaded through the treeline, He Song’s gaze swept over the forests that constantly receded around him. As he felt the strong wind that faced him, there was a sense of thrill in his heart.   The Wind Riding Skill.   Outdoes the Light Body Skill.   It’s far more practical.   The Light Body Skill, only makes the body lighter, allowing rapid dashes on the ground.   But the Wind Riding Skill? Manipulating the wind, it allows one to hover in mid-air for a long time.   Take a step, and you are hundreds of meters away.   And the speed is extremely fast.   Most importantly, you can fly!   Although not like a Foundation Establishment Master, who can use tunneling skills to travel thousands of miles, or ride a spirit boat in high flight.   However, when his body left the ground, and he was advancing forward at a high speed, this feeling still gave He Song a moment of intoxication.   But, since he was on his way, He Song quickly pulled himself together and continued to rush forward.   A few days later.   After a long, arduous journey, He Song finally appeared near the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   However, when he arrived at the valley where he had opened the spirit field, the scene before him made him frown.   A few hundred miles from the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   In the valley where He Song’s twenty-mu spirit field is located, all the arrays have failed. Due to the exhaustion of the spirit stones, they had become effectless.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com   Only the Illusion Array was barely maintaining the illusions of the place.   He Song, who had concealed his aura and tunneled underground to this place from far away, watched as the scene before him turn grim.   The Spirit-Gathering Arrays had all failed due to the exhaustion of spirit stones.    The Spirit-Gathering Arrays, which used to gather the spirit Qi from around, now looked like empty shells, devoid of any spirit gathering effects.   The Five Phases Array, which served both attack and defense, also seemed to have suffered some damage. He Song even saw a crack appearing in the base of the array.   The arrays set up here, at this moment, only the Illusion Array was left, maintaining a faint illusion, preventing this place from being discovered by other cultivators.   However, although the scene in front of him made He Song instantly realize that this place seemed to have been invaded by cultivators.   But, as there was no one around, and his own strength was enough, moreover he was a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   If attacked, even if he couldn’t win, he could quickly rush to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion for help.   Therefore, He Song didn’t rush to leave this place, instead, a light flashed in his eyes, and he looked towards the center of the valley.   At first glance.   He Song’s eyes immediately saw a scene different from before.   This place, where spirit Qi had dispersed and the spirit Qi gathered by the Spirit-Gathering Arrays had completely disappeared, leaving only a bit of sparse spirit Qi still lingering around.   However, in this place where the spirit Qi was sparse, He Song saw a scene of spirit Qi soaring in a certain place.   This anomaly almost instantly caught He Song’s attention.   After pondering.   He Song wielded his Red Gold Sword and Thick Earth Shield, and a few high-grade Thick Earth Amulets also appeared in his hand.   Only then did he cautiously leave the valley and came to a high mountain not far from the valley.   Atop the high mountain.   He Song hid his body under the ground, revealing only one eye,looking towards the place where the spirit Qi soared.   This glance, immediately made He Song’s eyes fill with utter astonishment.   In the valley.   Through the illusion of the Illusion Array, He Song quickly spotted the remains of a monk.   The bones were severely damaged, as if slashed by blades and axes or burned by fierce flames, making them look extremely battered.   Judging from the state of his death, it seemed as if he was killed by the Five Elements Array.   When He Song had just used his Spirit Vision Skill, the location of the surge of spirit Qi was exactly where the remains lay.   Seeing this, He Song examined the surroundings once more. After confirming there were no ambushes, he moved fully armed into the valley.   The moment he entered the valley, He Song cast several Array Foundations to completely repair the Five Elements Array.   After the Five Elements Array was fully repaired, he cast several more Array Foundations to reestablish the Illusion Array.   After completing these steps, and operating the two Arrays to envelop the entire valley, he detected no presence and finally let out a sigh of relief. His gaze then turned to the location of the remains.   Remaining vigilant, He Song soon arrived at the site of the remains.   A monk’s remains.    They contained a substantial amount of spirit Qi.   After a monk’s death, the spirit Qi in their bones gradually dissipates, returning to the heavens and the earth.   This is what causes the surge of spirit Qi.   However, if the person was killed and their body burned on the spot, the contained spirit Qi would quicky dissipate and there would be no surge of spirit   The remains before He Song were indeed those which had not been damaged after death.   “This person… I clearly set up the Illusion Array outside the Five Elements   Array. How could someone forcefully break in and get killed by the Five Elements Array?”   Staring at the remains before him, He Song was utterly perplexed.   Looking back at the twenty acres of spirit field full of dried up spirit rice, He Song let out a sigh.   If you’re going to die, just die.   And yet he ruined my twenty acres of spirit rice.   That’s over two thousand spirit stones!   If this person hadn’t forcefully intruded, the Five Elements Array wouldn’t have been activated.   It wouldn’t have been trying to kill this person, draining its own spirit stones, then forcefully drawing the spirit Qi from the Spirit-Gathering Array.   When the spirit stones in the Spirit-Gathering Array are exhausted and it becomes ineffective, the spirit rice naturally dies as well.   However, thankfully the Five Elements Array forcefully killed this person and didn’t allow him to escape. Otherwise, what He Song would have come upon would probably have been a completely empty valley. Though it didn’t differ much from that now.   But at least… he could loot the body.   To recoup some losses.   With a simple summon, the storage bag next to the remains fell into He Song’s hands.   After a brief sense-check, an array of items appeared before He Song.   Spirit stones.   Books.   Clothes.   Artifacts.   He Song was dazzled by the variety.   But upon a thorough search, he found that these items were only worth a little over five hundred spirit stones.   The wealth of a Qi-refining mid stage cultivator probably amounted to this.   Seeing this, He Song silently cursed his bad luck.   Then, with a spit of spirit Qi from his fingertips, a huge fireball suddenly appeared before him.   The next moment, the fireball fell, and the monk’s remains were instantly burned to ashes. Without hesitating, he gathered the ashes into the storage bag, and let out a sigh.   “Alas, I wonder if I can still use this spirit field… and if this person has any friends who might come here.”   His gaze sweeping over the twenty acres of spirit field behind him, a struggle flashed through He Song’s eyes..

Chapter 133 - 133: 132: The Killing Intent Arises Translator: 549690339   Everything that happened in the mountain valley.   He had already thought about such a day.   Years ago, when he came to open the spirit field here, he had thought about cultivators breaking into the valley.   However, precisely because of this, He Song chose to expand the range of the Illusion Array’s cover, hiding the Five Phases Array within it.   In this way, even if someone wanted to break through the arrays, they would be trapped in the Illusion Array.   Once they entered the Illusion Array, most cultivators would subconsciously leave under the influence of the array’s effect.   Only if the Illusion Array could not stop the opponent, or if they had a way to move forward and come into contact with the Five Phases Array, would it trigger the attack of the Five Phases Array.   But he had not expected that.   Even after making such preparations, there were still cultivators who perished under the Five Phases Array set up by himself.   And just when He Song hesitated whether he could still use this place.   The appearance of a sound -transmitting paper crane suddenly made him more cautious.   In the sky.   A sound-transmitting paper crane fell quietly and soon stopped outside the Illusion Array.   Without recalling the Artifacts on his body, He Song’s eyes flashed with spirit power as he looked around.   After confirming that there were no cultivators around, he went to the paper crane’s location, reaching out to release his own breath.   However.   When He Song’s breath touched the paper crane, the spirit Qi shining on the paper crane did not turn into a piece of paper; instead, its spirit Qi remained unchanged, causing He Song’s vigilance to reach its peak.   Subconsciously, He Song retreated quickly, instantly returning to the protection range of the Five Phases Array.   At the same time, a number of high-quality Thick Earth Amulets were ready to be activated. All they needed was for He Song’s thoughts to move, and they would thoroughly protect him.   Retreating into the Five Phases Array.   Glancing around and finding no other cultivators or attacks appearing, He Song looks at the paper crane with a sudden sense of danger in his heart.    “I can’t stay here. This sound- transmitting paper crane should be looking for the cultivator who died. I just don’t know if anyone will follow the direction of the paper crane and come here.”   Glancing at the withered spirit rice in the valley and the still shining paper crane outside the Illusion Array, He Song immediately decided to destroy this place and completely abandon the spirit field.   The sound-transmitting paper crane remained unresponsive for a long time, and the friends and family of the person who died under the Five Phases Array might eventually trace their way here.   Instead of continuing to plant spirit rice here and living in fear every day, it would be better to give up this place altogether and find another mountain valley to grow spirit rice.   In this way, he could both disassociate himself from the man’s death and ensure that the spirit field’s Array Skills would not be discovered by others.   Having thought this far, He Song no longer paid attention to the sound -transmitting paper crane. Instead, he started using Object Controlling Skills to uproot all the withered spirit rice in the spirit field.   Let the paper crane stay there.   If someone came afterward and found the sound-transmitting paper crane destroyed, they might immediately sense something wrong. It would be better not to deal with it and not expose his own existence.   Outside the Illusion Array.   There, the sound-transmitting paper crane was still shining.   In the Illusion Array.   He Song used Object Controlling Skills to uproot all the withered spirit rice in the twenty-acre spirit field, and then ignited a fire, reducing all the withered spirit rice into ashes.   He collected the ashes into a storage bag, planning to deal with them after leaving this place.   After doing all this, He Song was using Object Controlling Skills to level the ground, trying to restore the spirit field’s appearance back to that of an ordinary mountain valley.   But just as he was cleaning up the traces of the spirit field, another sound -transmitting paper crane descended from the sky and landed outside the Illusion Array.   Seeing this situation, He Song’s expression changed, and he immediately sped up the process of clearing the traces of the spirit field.   He manipulated spirit power through Object Controlling Skills to turn over and compress the twenty acres of land that had originally been turned into a spirit field in the valley.   In addition, He Song also manipulated his spirit power to scatter seeds of weeds over the turned-over land.   In this way, he only had to wait for ten days or half a month for the weeds to grow and cover the newly turned land, and his mountain valley would return to its original state, making it impossible to tell that there had ever been a twenty-acre spirit field here.   As for the spirit Qi contained in the spirit field.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates   In fact, as soon as the spirit rice withered and the Spirit-Gathering Array lost its effect, the spirit Qi in the spirit field had already gradually dissipated.   At this point, the twenty-acre spirit field had already degraded into ordinary farmland.   After being turned over by He Song, it only remained for the weeds to grow back for the area to return to its original state.   He Song was wrapping up the area.    After turning over the land and sowing the weed seeds, he collected all the Array Foundations of the now ineffective Spirit-Gathering Arrays.   But just at this moment.   The third sound-transmitting paper crane fell from the sky and landed outside the Illusion Array.   Seeing this situation, He Song’s expression slightly stiffened.   It was hard for the appearance of one paper crane after another not to make He Song think of something.   Perhaps, the person who died in the Five Phases Array, his friends, and family were looking for him this way.   Based on the timing of the paper cranes falling.   The other party should be getting closer and closer to this place.   However, if he left now and removed the Illusion Array and the Five Phases Array, the freshly turned land would completely expose his identity as an Array Path Master.   The freshly turned land might make the incoming person think that he was hiding something.   Following this line of thought, they might detect the twenty-acre spirit field that He Song had originally created here.   And the person who died in the Five Phases Array, his body was within this range.   Such a coincidence would surely make the incoming person suspicious.   If they couldn’t find He Song, they might publicize this matter on a large scale, and that was very likely.   By then…   Thinking of the scene where he would be surrounded and blocked by countless people, He Song couldn’t help but pale.   After some consideration, He Song accelerated the movements in his hands and did not remove the Illusion Array and Five Phases Array.   Only after a while, when all traces of the spirit field’s existence had been completely erased, did 1–1e Song finally breathe a sigh of relief and dive into the ground, making his way in the distance.   Underground, he also activated the Breath Concealment Formulas.   At this moment, He Song didn’t need to worry about others discovering him.   However, even so, he had to tunnel a few miles away from the valley before revealing one eye from the soil in a concealed spot, looking in the direction of the valley.   Finding a good hiding spot here, He Song sighed softly in his heart.   “It’s just bad luck that you arrived too early. If you had come ten days or half a month later, when the valley was restored to its original state, this wouldn’t have happened…”   With the intent to kill rising in his heart.   Several plans suddenly flashed through He Song’s mind.   If the person who came was extremely powerful, and they discovered that he had set up arrays and planted spirit rice in the valley, he would have to leave immediately.   At worst, he could sell off all the 110,000 pounds of spirit rice on his body before the news spread..

Chapter 134: Chapter 133: Three Kneels and Nine Bows   Translator: 549690339   He got the spirit stone.   Now he can go and cultivate a new spirit field.   However, since hes been exposed, He Song will not be able to sell spirit rice within the sphere of influence of the Thick Earth Sect anymore.   He must go to other Golden Elixir Great Sects in the surrounding area to sell the spirit rice in order to ensure his own safety.   If the strength of the person coming is neither too strong nor too weak, he would simply wait here for the person to step into the Five Phases Array and then take decisive action.   Under the double attack of the Five Phases Array and his own strength   Even if the person is a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator, He Song would have great confidence in dragging the person to their death here.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com   Here is He Songs home ground, and under the blessing of two Array Skills, he would only need to use the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill to launch a sneak attack from a distance.   Taking advantage of the enemys absence of mind and the distraction of dealing with the Five Phases Array   Its not unlikely that he can deliver a fatal or heavy blow to a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator in one strike.   At the same time, while the enemy has entered the Five Phases Array and is within the scope of the Illusion Array, there would be no chance for the enemy to escape once he makes his move.   With the death of this person   Not only would He Song not expose his identity, but also everything related to the spirit field in this valley would be completely concealed by the passage of time.   Just wait for ten days or half a month, and when the weeds in the valley begin to sprout and thrive, all traces here would disappear with them.   By that time, even if someone manages to track their way here, they would have no idea that there were once twenty acres of spirit fields.   People who come afterwards would only see a picturesque valley of green mountains and clear waters.   They would never suspect that there were once twenty acres of spirit fields here.   Besides   If the strength of the enemy is weak   Such as the Qi-refining mid stage or even lower   He Song would still wait for the person to enter the Five Phases Arrays coverage area before making a move.   With He Songs current seventh-tier Qi Refining cultivation, dealing with a cultivator at the Qi-refining mid stage or even Qi Refining Early Stage could be considered effortless.   However, to prevent escape, He Song decided to play it safe.   If he doesnt make a move, and when he does, it would be a thunderous strike.   A few miles away from the valley, He Song only had one eye showing as he looked towards the valley.   Soon   The fourth sound-transmitting paper crane descended from the sky and landed outside the Illusion Array. Then came the fifth, the sixth    A moment later   A sneaky figure suddenly emerged from the woods, holding a sound -transmitting paper crane that soared into the sky, heading straight towards the valley in front of him.   Upon seeing this scene, the figure immediately looked up at the sound-transmitting paper crane.   However, when he saw the paper crane quickly stopping outside the valley in front of him, a glimmer of delight flashed through his eyes.   Following that, the person rushed towards the valley without hesitation.bender   A few miles away   He Song had already seen the person as soon as they appeared.   His eyes flickered with divine light.   He Song let out a sigh of relief.   The person approaching was in the sixth-tier Qi Refining stage.   Qi-refining mid stage.   After learning the persons cultivation level, a weight was immediately lifted from He Songs heart.   He had long been prepared for the worst, but now it seemed that he might not need to turn and leave as soon as he saw the person, like he had thought before.   Only at sixth-tier Qi Refining   For He Song, even a head-on confrontation is considered easy to defeat.   Perhaps, without He Songs actions, the Five Phases Array could directly send this person to their demise.   Not to mention that a cultivator at the Qi-refining mid stage had previously died under the Five Phases Array.   Furthermore, he had already made plans.   Now, just waiting for the person to step into the Five Phases Array, he can wash his hands of this person and completely erase this places abnormalities, and his own secrets would naturally not be discovered by others.   He Song is waiting.   However, the person approaching from afar has already arrived outside the valley at this moment.   After seeing the few sound-transmitting paper cranes flashing with spirit light outside the valley, the excitement in the persons eyes vanished in a flash.   Ive been searching for a long time, but luckily I knew Mr. Li disappeared in this area. Otherwise, it would be hard to follow the paper crane with its fast speed.   Mr. Lis breath disappeared here. Could this valley be the inherited token left behind by a senior he mentioned before leaving?   Its been half a year since I last saw Mr. Li, and he might have already perished. I, Chen Zhong, will gladly accept this seniors inheritance.   As he spoke, Chen Zhong took the paper cranes in his hand and carefully stowed them away, before bowing three times and kowtowing nine times toward the valley.   I, Chen Zhong, if I receive the inheritance of a senior today, I will definitely carry on the legacy and never forget the kindness of the senior!   Looking at his appearance, he seems to think that there is some seniors inheritance in this place.   And he even bowed three times and kowtowed nine times, as if trying to move the senior with sincerity.    Seeing this scene, He Songs face looked strange.   He never expected that the spirit field he cultivated would be mistaken for a cultivators burial ground by someone else.   Although in the Cultivation World, its common for cultivators to obtain a seniors inheritance in the wild, this valley doesnt look like a cultivators tomb at all, does it?   This Chen Zhong even kowtowed here for some kind of seniors inheritance.   This   Is simply absurd.   However, just when He Song was feeling strange in his heart and thought it was absurd, Chen Zhong suddenly disappeared from the spot.   He Song looked carefully.   It turns out that Chen Zhong directly stepped into the Illusion Array.   The Illusion Array is only a beginners Array Skill, which can hide the breath, obscure the sight, and also has a slight confusing effect.   At most, it can make cultivators and mortals subconsciously avoid the place.   For this kind of cultivator who actively seeks it out and is determined to break in, it doesnt have much use.   Therefore   As soon as the person stepped into the Illusion Arrays coverage, the illusions created by the array swallowed him up.   To the outside world, it looked as if this person suddenly vanished from the spot, which was quite strange.   Seeing this   He Songs eyes remained focused on Chen Zhong.   He Song could see through the Illusion Array he had laid out himself.   Thus, he could keep his eyes locked on Chen Zhong.   Until Chen Zhong stepped a few steps into the Illusion Array and entered the Five Phases Array very quickly.   In an instant   The murderous aura in the Five Phases Array suddenly rose.   Under the surge of the Five Phases power, a series of attacks came down from the sky, directly aiming for Chen Zhong.   Golden sword light, burning vines, large falling stones as tall as a person   Under the operation of the Five Phases Array, a series of attacks followed one after another, directly attacking Chen Zhong, who had just entered the array.   However, even though he was suddenly attacked, Chen Zhong didnt panic; instead, a hint of excitement appeared on his face.   Good, good! I knew Mr. Li came here to find a seniors inheritance and didnt return for half a year. It turns out theres an Array Skill guarding it.   Luckily, Im prepared for this. Once I break through this Array Skill, Im sure Ill gain a lot.   As he spoke, Chen Zhong suddenly produced a shield in his hand.   With a thought, the shield in his hand immediately blocked the incoming attacks and firmly protected him..

Chapter 135: Chapter 134: Killing with One Strike   Translator: 549690339   Seeing this, Chen Zhong threw his head back and laughed. He quickly sat cross-legged and started to recoup his spirit power by absorbing spirit stones.   He knew nothing about breaking the array with agility.   But as for breaking it with brute force, he was an expert.   As a loose cultivator, he had seen such array skills in various places.   With such an array, all you need to do is drain the spirit stones within the array and it will be completely ineffective.   He had Artifact protection and brought enough elixirs and spirit stones to last a long time within the array.bender   In this way, as long as he could exhaust the spirit stones in the array, the array would naturally dissipate.   Once that happened, it would be his time to harvest the legacy of the senior cultivator.   Chen Zhong had such an idea in his mind and a big smile appeared on his face.   He seemed to see the so-called legacy already.   However.   Just as he was sitting and absorbing spirit Qi to restore his spirit power, He Song, originally several miles away, had already returned to the valley through earth tunneling.   He presented the Red Gold Sword.   The Thick Earth Shield was also presented.   In his hand, were several high-quality Thick Earth Amulets.   He Song calmly watched Chen Zhong, who was in the midst of the Five Phases Array, and immediately without hesitation, employed Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill.   With a flash of red-gold light.   Inside the Five Phases Array.   Chen Zhong, who had been eagerly contemplating the future, thought he would obtain the legacy of the senior cultivators and from this point forward, he staggered and fell on the ground.   Until the moment his head was cut off by the Red Gold Sword, he couldnt understand.   Why did the attack from the Five Phases Array suddenly become so terrifying?   Everything was originally going well.   His Artifact shield could block all attacks, and he only had to sustain his spirit power output to hold out for a long time.   But, why did a red-gold flash pass by, and the headless body in front of him emerged?   This headless body, he recognized.   It was his own body.   It wasnt until his decapitated head, which had already fallen to the ground, suddenly noticed that the Five Phases Arrays attack had entirely disappeared, and the figure of He Song had appeared, that he realized.   It turns out, someone got here first.   As such a thought flashed across his mind, the last scene Chen Zhong saw was a massive fireball swallowing him whole as He Song casually pointed.   He did not know that what he and Mr. Li were looking for was not really a legacy of a senior cultivator.   But a spirit field that produced more than 20,000 catties of spirit rice annually.   Within just a year, over 2,000 spirit stones could be harvested.    If they really took control of this spirit field, their path in life would undoubtedly change drastically.   In the future, there might even be a chance for Foundation Establishment.   Unfortunately.   He came at an inconvenient time.   If he had come ten days or half a month later, He Song would have already left and the valley would have returned to its original state, untraceable.   If He Song hadnt worried about revealing his identity.   He might not have ended up dying in this way.   After burning Chen Zhongs dead body into ashes and storing them in a storage bag for later use, He Song finally picked up his storage bag.   It was an inferior storage bag.   The standard storage bag used by the vast majority of Qi-refining mid-stage, or even Qi-refining late-stage, loose cultivators.   After casually flipping through it, He Songs eyes flashed with surprise.   Inside the storage bag, besides spirit stones and Artifacts, there were entirely restorative elixirs for restoring spirit power.   So many elixirs were naturally expensive.   He Song calculated it all, and the items in the storage bag were worth over 700 spirit stones, making him a relatively wealthy Qi-refining mid-stage loose cultivator.   This man indeed sensed something and prepared quite thoroughly.   He put away the storage bag, sighed, and then sat down to meditate and cultivate.   He had just killed a man.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com   He Song planned to wait here for a while until the weeds in the valley started to grow back and gradually return to their original state unnoticed, then he would leave.   With the Five Phases Array and the Illusion Array there, he didnt have to worry about his safety.   Even if someone discovered this place within the short span of half a month, He Song had set up the Illusion Array and Five Phases Array. Even if he couldnt win in a fight, he could still manage to escape.   Since it wouldnt pose a threat to his own safety.   Why not wait here until the valley returns to its previous state before leaving.   After all, if someone stumbled upon the valley after he left and noticed the abnormalities, it would cause more trouble.   With this in mind.   Half a month had quickly passed by.   Durinz this time, He Sonz had erased all traces of himself, the spirit fields, and   Array Skills from the valley.   Today, He Song had even dismantled the Five Phases Array and the Illusion Array.   The valley, once home to twenty acres of spirit field, was now overrun with wild plants. It was impossible to tell that twenty acres of spirit fields had ever existed here.   Plants in the Cultivation World grow rapidly with the nourishment of sparse spirit Qi.   Once all traces had been completely erased.   He Song disappeared into the ground and quickly set off towards the distance.   However, along his way, he began to look for a place to set up a new spirit field. The valley near the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion could no longer be used.   He Song couldnt guarantee that no one would trace back to the valley in the future.    Therefore.   It would be better to find a new secluded place to establish a spirit field.   After distancing himself from the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, He Song emerged from underground, activated the Mountain Wind Riding Skill, and while heading back to the Thick Earth Sect, he started looking for a new hiding place.   Unconsciously, He Song deviated from his original straight path and took a detour.   Quickly, several days passed.   Ideal locations for establishing spirit fields were indeed scarce.   In the past few days, He Song had yet to find a suitable place.   He Song continued to walk forward, but the place he was in had slightly deviated from his original path.   As He Song carried on, an unexpected glance made his eyes light up.   At an unknown time, he had arrived at the top of a valley.   Beneath his feet, the valley was shrouded in mist, had a huge inner space, and was surrounded by high mountains.   Such a scene immediately made He Songs eyes light up with surprise. This place seems fit to set up a spirit field.   As this idea flashed through his mind, a fiery excitement lit up in He Songs eyes as he looked at the valley.   This valley seemed to be even larger than the first valley where he set up his spirit field.   With a rough estimate, if he established a spirit field in this valley, he would be able to create a field that spanned thirty acres!   Thirty acres of spirit fields!   This would produce over thirty thousand catties of spirit rice every year.   After selling it, he would earn over three thousand spirit stones.   With this in mind, He Song promptly stopped and quickly descended into the valley engulfed in clouds and fog.   He looked around.   The valley was shrouded in cloud and fog above, and below flowed gentle streams, snaking like a jade dragon in the valley.   The valley was rich in fertile soil, and without dense spirit Qi, there was no need to worry about attracting other cultivators.   The more He Song looked, the more satisfied he became.   This was indeed a good place to establish a spirit field.   Moreover, it was only several thousand miles away from the Thick Earth Sect, which was less than half the distance from the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Comparatively, establishing a spirit field here would be more convenient than continuing towards the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   However, to set up a spirit field here, he needed to first set up an Illusion Array, a Five Phases Array, and a Spirit-Gathering Array that could cover thirty acres of spirit field.   Thinking and acting.   After several days of preparations, the Array Skills completely covered the valley.   After all this was done, He Song looked at the storage bags on him and planned to sell some goods.   The fields in this valley will take two years to fully transform into a spirit field, and it will take another year before they can produce spirit rice.   First sell off the spirit rice in my possession, then sell off the other things I carry and find an Immortal Pavilion.   A map flashed in He Songs mind.   He quickly figured out his current general location and immediately located the position of the nearest Immortal Pavilion.   The Flowers Immortal Pavilion?

Chapter 136 - 136: 135: 10,000 Spirit Stones Translator: 549690339   “Flowers Immortal Pavilion?”   “Why does this name sound a bit off?”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎   After finding the location of the closest Flowers Immortal Pavilion to him, a thought flashed through He Song’s mind.   But then he shook his head and cast the thought aside.   He was here to sell goods.   Not to look for flowers.   Whether it’s called Flowers Immortal Pavilion or whatever, it didn’t matter.   It didn’t affect his selling spirit rice and disposing of stolen goods.   After one last glance at the valley that had been completely shrouded by Array Skills, He Song’s figure soared up into the air, swiftly heading towards the location of the Flowers Immortal Pavilion.   Soon.   In just one day, He Song appeared at the entrance of the Flowers Immortal Pavilion.   At this time, He Song was completely covered in a black robe, constantly using the Breath Concealment Formulas to hide all his breath.   With such attire, He Song seemed incredibly mysterious.   However, there were similarly dressed people passing by from time to time, so He Song’s appearance wasn’t very conspicuous.   Scanning the surroundings, He Song’s figure halted slightly.   Flowers Immortal Pavilion.   Named after the variety of spirit flowers planted within the pavilion.   Unlike other pavilions, the Flowers Immortal Pavilion did not have spirit rice planted on the periphery.   Instead, it was covered in enchanting spirit flowers.   These spirit flowers were used for making incense, adding flavor to spirit alcohol, bathing cultivators, and more.   In short, spirit flowers were of great value.   Immediately, he was enveloped by a fragrant aroma.   It was the season of blooming flowers, and as He Song looked around, he felt as if both he and the entire Flowers Immortal Pavilion were immersed in a sea of flowers.   Countless spirit flowers were competing for attention in the flower field, bringing an intense visual impact.   But He Song merely paused for a moment before his gaze shifted to the map of the Flowers Immortal Pavilion placed at the entrance.   The map showed various areas of the Flowers Immortal Pavilion and the location of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion that He Song was looking for.   Flowers Immortal Pavilion.    They also had a Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Although this place was full of spirit flowers, cultivators also needed spirit rice for their daily cultivation.   The Spiritual Medicine Pavilion in the Flowers Immortal Pavilion bought and sold spirit flowers as well as spirit rice.   After a glance at the map.   He Song remembered the different areas of the Flowers Immortal Pavilion and strode in.   This time.   He Song’s cultivation had reached the Qi-refining late stage, and his mood when selling spirit rice and disposing of stolen goods was quite different from before.   When he first sold spirit rice, he was cautious, fearing that he might be watched.   Now, with his Qi-refining late stage cultivation level, although he was still careful, his mind was much calmer than before.   At least, with his strength guaranteed, he was no longer afraid of those insignificant people.   Even if he couldn’t win a fight, he could still run away.   With this mindset, He Song as a whole became more confident.   Even the pace at which he walked was a little swifter.   This was the benefit that strength brought to him.   Flowers Immortal Pavilion. Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   In the VIP room.   He Song took a sip of the spirit tea and a satisfied look flashed through his eyes.   Indeed, the Flowers Immortal Pavilion had excellent spirit tea, combined with a rich floral aroma that was unforgettable.   “Mr. Han, does our Flowers Immortal Pavilion spirit tea meet your standards?”   Next to He Song, a wealthy-looking young man with curved eyebrows inquired with a smile.   This man’s name was Fang He, the Steward in-charge of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion at Flowers Immortal Pavilion, who was taking care of He Song.   Facing He Song, a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator, even Spiritual Medicine Pavilion dared not to be careless.   Execution.time: 180s   As soon as He Song entered the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, the spiritual pressure of a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator immediately alarmed him.   Then, He Song was directly escorted into the VIP room.   Moreover, he was personally attended to by Fang He, the Steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   “Not bad, such spirit tea, even compared to Green Immortal Spirit Tea, has its unique charm. Good tea, good tea.”   Putting down the teacup, He Song casually complimented.   Then, he waved his hand.    Suddenly, a small cargo storage bag appeared on the table in front of He Song.   He Song had come here not to drink tea.   But to sell spirit rice.   Having a sip of tea was just a courtesy to the host. More importantly, it was about selling spirit rice.   “This is…”   Seeing this, Fang He took a look and, after getting He Song’s approval, picked up the small cargo storage bag from the table.   Then, a look of surprise appeared on his face.   “Eleven thousand catties of spirit rice, is Mr. Han from a Foundation Establishment Clan?”   When He Song came here, he used Han Feiyu as his name when introducing himself.   As for his real name, there was no way he’d reveal it.   Moreover, since the name Han Feiyu had appeared once before, using it again would serve to confuse others.   So when Fang He spoke, he addressed He Song as Mr. Han.   He Song didn’t answer Fang He’s question, just silently stared at him without saying a word.   It wasn’t until a moment later when Fang He felt uneasy and started sweating that He Song withdrew his gaze.   “Mr. Fang, how much spirit stone can I get for this spirit rice?”   Without answering Fang He’s question, He Song directly asked for the price.   According to He Song’s estimation.   When selling spirit rice in the Immortal Pavilion’s Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, generally speaking, they would take a 10% profit margin.   The eleven thousand catties of spirit rice he offered could be sold for eleven thousand spirit stones at market price.   However, deducting the 10% profit would make the selling price of these eleven thousand catties of spirit rice drop to nine thousand nine hundred spirit stones.   Such a deduction made He Song’s heart ache slightly.   But to sell these spirit rice quickly, He Song had no choice but to sell.   He simply didn’t want to get caught up in mind games and potential danger with loose cultivators over such a small amount of spirit stones.   Bothersome.   Too troublesome.   Therefore, sacrificing some profit and selling all the spirit rice in one go to the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion was what He Song needed to do.   “Eleven thousand catties of spirit rice, minus the 10% profit, is nine thousand, nine hundred spirit stones.”   Seeing that He Song didn’t answer his question, Fang He cautiously began to speak, but soon came up with another price.   “Of course, Mr. Han, this spirit rice of yours is of top quality – full and rich in spirit Qi. I can offer ten thousand spirit stones to take it all.”   “I just hope that if you have the chance in the future, you will visit our Flowers Immortal Pavilion Spiritual Medicine Pavilion again.”   As he spoke, Fang He wore a flattering smile, as though he genuinely anticipated He Song’s return.   Seeing this, He Song cautiously examined Fang He and, upon finding nothing suspicious, he nodded in agreement..

Chapter 137 - 137: 136: Black Market Translator: 549690339   “Alright, if there’s a next time, I will certainly come back and continue trading with you.”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com   As He Song spoke, he had already made up his mind.   From now on, he would never set foot in Flowers Immortal Pavilion again.   This Fang He, even offering a profit of a hundred spirit stones, wanted He Song to owe him a favor and continue trading with him here. Moreover, he didn’t even think of asking for a kickback.   This was too unusual.   He Song knew that during his first sale of spirit rice in Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion, the manager of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion casually took a kickback within their conversation.   But here, this Fang He wasn’t even asking for a kickback.   Such an abnormal thing instantly made He Song more cautious.   However, He Song didn’t show his caution on the surface, appearing calm, but in his heart, he had marked this place as forbidden.   After today,   He Song would definitely not come back to Flowers Immortal Pavilion.   At the same time, he also had to be cautious of Fang He.   After he finished fencing the goods, he must be extremely careful, so he wouldn’t have any accidents.   After fencing the goods, he must leave immediately.   With that thought, He Song’s gaze towards Fang He remained calm.   As if he was completely unaware, and didn’t show any signs of being on guard.   Seeing He Song agreeing, Fang He also showed a faint smile on his face.   The transaction that followed went very smoothly on both sides.   He Song successfully obtained ten thousand spirit stones, greatly enriching his treasury.   Meanwhile, Fang He received the one hundred and ten thousand catties of spirit rice He Song had brought and stored them in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion’s warehouse.   After personally escorting He Song out of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, The smile on Fang He’s face gradually disappeared.   Watching He Song’s retreating back, a glint flashed in Fang He’s eyes and disappeared quickly.   “One hundred and ten thousand catties of spirit rice, and not a member of the Foundation Establishment Clan, who is this person?”   Fang He speculated quietly in his mind about He Song’s actions since entering the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, but he couldn’t come to any conclusions.   “Ten thousand spirit stones…”   Finally,            Fang He sighed and vanished into the darkness, his voice fading away, leaving no trace of him in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Ten thousand spirit stones,   Is more than enough to drive a Qi-refining late stage cultivator to take enormous risks.   After leaving the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion,   He Song appeared calm but kept a low profile and watched his back, wanting to see if anyone was following him.   However, after observing for a while, He Song didn’t find anything.   Seeing this,   He Song breathed a sigh of relief.   It seemed that within the Immortal Pavilion, he didn’t need to worry about anything.   That being the case,   He could go on and fence the goods.   After fencing the goods, he would leave and go to the inn, just like he did last time in Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion.   Following the map in his memory, He Song quickly arrived at the Stall Section of Flowers Immortal Pavilion.   On his body, there were now three inferior storage bags and one small cargo storage bag.   In addition, there were four artifacts, some elixirs, and miscellaneous items.   The Stall Section was the perfect place to fence goods.   It was filled with all sorts of people.   No need to mention just these items, even if He Song had acquired the entire fortune of a Qi Refining late-stage cultivator, he would be able to sell them quickly.   Walking through the Stall Section,   He Song soon saw some booths with black cloth mats at the very bottom. Having mingled in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion for years,   He naturally understood that these booths with black cloth mats were where all kinds of stolen goods were bought.   Since they were usually black cloth mats, they were also called Black Market.   They were often active in various Immortal Pavilions and even Immortal Cities, buying and selling various stolen goods.   Those who operated these booths were cultivators who had backers behind them; they wouldn’t ask where your goods came from and wouldn’t make you worry about any risks after selling them.   Of course,   They were able to do so because of the huge profits involved.   The purchase prices here were much lower than those in regular Artifacts Pavilions.   A minor artifact, if sold in a regular Artifacts Pavilion, would usually cost around a hundred spirit stones.   But if sold here, it would fetch only around sixty spirit stones.            A 40% difference.   With such huge profits, booths like these existed in every Immortal Pavilion.   Even Immortal Cities had such places as well.   In Immortal Cities though, they normally rented shops rather than booths.   Approaching one such booth,   He Song nonchalantly took out two inferior storage bags and just flashed them in front of the booth owner before putting them away.   Seeing this,   The booth owner’s eyes immediately lit up.   Not hiding anything, he directly closed the booth and left.   He Song saw this and chuckled in response, following right behind.   Of course, it wasn’t possible to trade stolen goods openly in the Stall Section.   Outside the Stall Section,   In a small teahouse,   By the time He Song reached the teahouse, the booth owner had already taken a seat in a corner.   Seeing He Song arrive, the booth owner promptly waved him over.   He Song looked around and, upon realizing that he was in a busy area and didn’t need to worry about being ambushed, only then did he enter the teahouse and sit down in front of the booth owner. As they sat at a table, neither of them spoke.   The booth owner looked at He Song.   He Song casually waved his hand, placing the three inferior storage bags and one small cargo storage bag he held on the table.   Then, he took out the four artifacts, elixirs, and miscellaneous items he carried and placed them on the table as well.   Of the three inferior storage bags, one was obtained by Wei Fan after killing Chen Zhou and gifted to He Song later; He Song used it till he joined the Thick Earth Sect before replacing it.   As for the other two inferior storage bags, one was obtained from an unknown corpse near Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, and the other was taken after killing Chen Zhong.   The small cargo storage bag, on the other hand, was purchased by He Song in   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion. Now that the spirit rice had been sold, there was no use for it.   As for the four artifacts, elixirs, and other miscellaneous items, they were naturally obtained from the corpse of the unknown person and from the killing of Chen Zhong.   As loose cultivators, both of them were in the Qi Refining mid-stage with one offensive and one defensive minor artifact each. Now, both were dead,   And their belongings ended up in He Song’s possession.   When He Song laid out all the items he planned to fence, the booth owner’s face had changed from its initial excitement and anticipation to a solemn expression.   He couldn’t help it, the goods He Song brought out   Were a bit too much for a Qi-refining mid-stage cultivator like him.   Even in the Black Market, the bold action of eagerly showing four storage bags, plus four minor artifacts, was rarely seen.   Not to mention, He Song was also dressed in a black robe and concealed his breath.   With such a style, it was hard for him not to imagine something. Could the person in front of him be an Evil Cultivator?

Chapter 138 - 138: 137: Fat Sheep Translator: 549690339   A malevolent being who could easily kill two middle-stage Qi-refining cultivators would probably be at least a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator, wouldn’t they?   Moreover, a well-experienced late-stage Qi Refining cultivator at that.   Since He Song could easily slay two mid-stage Qi-refining cultivators.   So, killing him would similarly be a piece of cake.   Faced with such a malevolent being who could effortlessly rob him of his life, even backed by powerful support, the stall owner still felt immense pressure at that moment.   Under He Song’s gaze.   The stall owner swallowed a mouthful of saliva, then started to inspect the items with a solemn expression.   He checked the storage bag.   Picked up the Artifacts to inspect their quality.   Opened the jade bottle to examine the elixir.   Tossed assorted items around, calculating their price.   After a moment, when all prices had been calculated.   Sweating profusely, fear now added to the look he gave He Song.   These things are clearly the relics of two mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators, and moreover, represent the wealth that only powerful mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators would possess.   And now.   All were in He Song’s possession.   One can infer what exactly happened.   Facing such a malevolent person, the stall owner was afraid that if he reported a low price, it would bring about his own demise.   But He Song was already looking at him, and even though he was unwilling, he had to speak up.   “Sir, the total is eight hundred spirit stones, what do you think?”   There was a tremble in his voice, and the stall owner was prepared to increase the price at any moment.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m   All he wanted now was to save his own life.   Four storage bags could normally fetch four hundred spirit stones when sold.   Four lower quality Artifacts could also fetch four hundred spirit stones when sold.   Various elixirs and spirit amulets that Chen Zhong had prepared in advance, along with miscellaneous items, all these would amount to an value not below average.   However, since they were selling in this place, the price naturally had to be discounted.   Based on He Song’s own calculation, these items were worth seven hundred spirit stones, which was already quite good.   Unexpectedly, there was an unexpected joy.   He Song’s eyes flashed a hint of satisfaction as he got an extra one hundred spirit stones out of the blue.   Feeling the price was fair, He Song nodded in agreement to the transaction.   Seeing this, the stall owner was beside himself with joy. He quickly took care of He Song’s spirit stones.   Once the transaction was finished, He Song left the small teahouse and rapidly headed toward the inn at Flowers Immortal Pavilion.   Last time.   At Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion, He Song departed from the inn.   That time, his departure did not alert anyone, nor was he noticed by anyone.   From his departure to his return to Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, no one had shown up to intercept him.    Thus, leaving through the same method became He Song’s first choice once again.   He Song went to the inn.   However, outside the small teahouse.   The stall owner who had bought He Song’s items was now in trouble.   “Stop! What did that man who just made a transaction with you sell?”   Just as the stall owner had put away the items he received from He Song and left the small teahouse, heading towards his own base.   A man in a black robe blocked his path.   Then, the presence of a late-stage Qi-refining cultivator emerged.   Even though it only lasted for a brief moment, it still caused the stall owner’s face to turn pale.   In this little Flowers Immortal Pavilion.   A late-stage Qi-refining cultivator was not any ordinary cabbage.   Even he, a black-market stall owner was merely a sixth-tier Qi Refining person.   Despite having a supporter behind him, it was still questionable whether his supporter would step in for a minor character like him.   “Sir, everything that the other Sir sold is right here… if you would like to have it…consider it a gift from me.”   Meeting two late-stage Qi Refining cultivators in such a short period of time, the stall owner felt he just had bad luck.   In order to survive, he could only reluctantly hand over all the items to the man in the black robe in front of him, hoping to avoid disaster.   At the same time, he closely watched the man in black robe before him without raising any suspicions.   A daring idea then emerged in his mind.   Could it be…The man who sold the items to him wanted them back?   However, he quickly dismissed the idea.   The man in black robe before him did not have the same physique as He Song, who had traded with him earlier.   Although they both wore black robes, there were still differences.   At his side, the man in black robe, without showing any politeness, took the parcel from the stall owner upon hearing his words.   This person was Fang He, the steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion under the Flowers Immortal Pavilion.   After He Song left the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, Fang He had followed him all the way here.   He had just witnessed the trading process between He Song and the stall owner in front of him.   Suspicious, he stopped the stall owner, wanting to see what exactly He Song had sold.   However, when he saw what was inside the package…   Fang He’s face changed drastically.   Inside the package…   There were four storage bags.   Four Artifacts.   There were also several elixirs and spirit amulets.   And a variety of other miscellaneous items.   Such a large and messy collection of items indicated that all these things were stolen goods.   As for their origin… perhaps they were plundered from people like himself who had He Song in their sights?   For a moment, cold sweat dripped from Fang He’s forehead.   He had thought he had set his sights on a fat sheep.   But he didn’t expect that this ‘sheep’ was actually a wolf in sheep’s clothing.    Looking at the items casually thrown in by He Song, he could sense that He Song’s strength was definitely not weak.   Moreover, how would a fat sheep know about the existence of the Black Market in the Immortal Pavilion?   How could a fat sheep, as a loose cultivator, cultivate to the Qi-refining late stage?   If it really were a fat sheep…   With so many thoughts flashing through his mind, Fang He felt a chill running down his spine.   Had he not been careful and deliberately stopped this person, wanting to check what He Song had given…   Perhaps he would have followed him and tried to kill He Song by now?   By then…   With He Song’s cunning nature, he was likely to end up handing over everything to He Song.   Thinking about this scenario, Fang He felt a chill running from his head to toe, making him shudder.   In a moment, he woke up completely, the greed in his heart completely disappeared.   What replaced it was an intense feeling of regret.   A regular person would not be able to casually pull out so much spirit rice.   One that’s worth ten thousand spirit stones.   Such a large sum wasn’t something an ordinary cultivator could afford.   Could all this spirit rice have been plundered from the bodies of dead cultivators?   The more he thought about it, the more scared he became, feeling like he had seen through everything.   If he hadn’t been a little careful…   “Get lost.’   Leaving behind these words, Fang He, full of regret, turned and ran as if the wind was at his heels, disappearing from the scene in an instant.   And also, disappearing along with him…   Was the package that the stall owner had purchased from He Song for eight hundred spirit stones.   The stall owner, having spent eight hundred spirit stones for nothing, felt utterly miserable.   However, the two people who had caused him loss were both Qi-refining late-stage cultivators, even though he was gritting his teeth in anger, he could only swallow his rage due to his own lack of power.   Having looked around and not seeing anyone stopping him, the stall owner also left.   But looking at his stumbling steps…   His mood didn’t seem very pleasant.   In this business, big profits always came with big risks.   Black Market, Black Market.   Incidents of swindling were not uncommon.   But He Song, who was currently in the inn, had no idea about everything that had happened after he left.   In the room of the inn, He Song activated his Array Skills, hiding his aura.   He then burned up his black robe.   He then used his spirit power to cleanse himself and his storage bag.   Ensuring that there were no residual traces on him that could be tracked.   After doing all this, he changed into a new black robe.   Then, he burrowed underground and quickly left Flowers Immortal Pavilion.   Being underground, he moved swiftly.   Under the cover of invisibility, he quickly left the Flowers Immortal Pavilion and headed for the distance.   He Song was completely unaware that his casual act of disposing stolen goods had scared off a Qi-refining late-stage cultivator who had him in his sights. However…   After traveling hundreds of miles away from the Flowers Immortal Pavilion and seeing no pursuit, He Song made a turn. Instead of returning to the Thick Earth Sect, he headed towards the location of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal   Pavilion..

Chapter 139 - 139: 138: Visiting Relatives and Friends Translator: 549690339   Since it was the time for leaving the sect to gain experience.   Returning too early might cause unnecessary troubles.   Why not visit some friends and relatives first?   Wait until it’s about the right time, then return to the sect.   If he remembered correctly, Zhao Lin should still be in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   He Song and Wei Fan had joined the Thick Earth Sect, and among the friends in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, only Zhao Lin was left for He Song.   For this amulet Tao master who had helped him a lot, He Song had not rorgotten mm.   Soon.   After several days, He Song returned to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and met Zhao Lin.   After a long talk with Zhao Lin, the two exchanged information about their recent situation.   Zhao Lin’s cultivation level had reached the sixth-tier of Qi Refining.   When they first met more than ten years ago, Zhao Lin’s cultivation level was higher than He Song’s.   At that time, He Song was at the third-tier of Qi Refining.   Zhao Lin was at the fourth-tier.   That was the reason why Meng Guan handed the management position of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion to him.   But now, more than ten years had passed in the blink of an eye.   He Song’s cultivation had broken through to the seventh-tier of Qi Refining, and he had made great progress within this tier.   As for Zhao Lin,   Although he was an amulet Tao master and had no shortage of resources, His cultivation was still caught up and surpassed by He Song.   Since He Song set up the Spirit-Gathering Array, his cultivation speed had become faster and faster.   Together with his near-exhausting promotion afterwards, He Song’s cultivation progress could be said to be extremely fast.   As an amulet Tao master, Zhao Lin could not keep up with He Song’s progress.   However,   Zhao Lin had now become a well-known amulet Tao master in the area.   He had gone further on the path of a Taoist master than He Song and obtained more and more spirit stones.   As for Zhao Lin,   Upon learning that He Song’s cultivation had broken through to the seventh-tier of Qi Refining,   Meng Guan had successfully established his foundation and become a Foundation Establishment Master.   When He Song joined the Thick Earth Sect under Meng Guan’s guidance, Zhao Lin also sighed.   Many years ago, his relationship with Meng Guan was pretty good, although it wasn’t like He Song’s relationship with Meng Guan, where they formed a small circle of friends.    But compared to ordinary friends, they were much closer.   It can be seen by the fact that when Meng Guan left, he handed over the management position of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion to Zhao Lin.   But.   After Meng Guan left the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and went to mine Red Spirit Gold, his relationship with Meng Guan gradually faded.   Until now, they hadn’t been in contact for a long, long time.   Hearing suddenly that his good friend from the past had become a Foundation   Establishment Master ,   But the relationship between himself and this good friend had gradually drifted apart, Zhao Lin’s feelings were imaginable.   However, after a moment of loss, Zhao Lin regained his usual calmness.   Raising his teacup and toasting towards the direction of the Thick Earth Sect, Zhao Lin sighed.   “It’s time, it’s fate, I am not qualified to ask for Meng Guan’s help anymore, but his kindness in helping me, I always keep in my heart.”   After saying that, Zhao Lin drank the tea in his cup and began to talk about other interesting things.   It’s as if he wanted to leave everything behind.   Seeing this, He Song could only close his mouth without mentioning it, and continue accompanying him.   The relationship between people also needs to be cultivated.   If you haven’t been in contact for a long time, the relationship will naturally fade.   Just like Zhao Lin and Meng Guan now.   That’s it.   After reconnecting with Zhao Lin,   Several days later.   He Song was about to leave when a scene of a little girl running towards him suddenly flashed through his mind.   His steps paused.   He Song sighed and soon arrived at the outer perimeter of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion’s First District.   Years ago, the little girl who used to ask him for candy had already embarked on the path of cultivation and matured into a graceful lady.   When they met again, it was she who nudged him out of his bewilderment.   Now, they hadn’t seen each other for many years.   I wonder how she’s doing now.   While walking on the streets of the First District, He Song’s gaze scanned the surroundings, constantly searching for that familiar figure.   However, after searching for quite some time, He Song still hadn’t found her.   He searched for a while longer.   He Song stopped walking.   A thin piece of paper then appeared in his hand.    If he couldn’t find her, he could just arrange a place and wait for her to come.   Spirit power surged out, inscribing the address of a nearby teahouse on the paper, inviting Su Yan to meet him there.   Immediately afterward, He Song released a burst of spirit power from his fingertips.   Soon, the thin paper in his hand transformed into a sound-transmitting paper crane, soaring into the sky and flying into the distance.   He Song glanced at the direction the paper crane flew and turned to enter the teahouse.   In a short while.   He Song, who was already waiting in the teahouse, was eventually joined by Su   Yan.   As she entered the teahouse, her eyes scanned the area, and upon spotting He Song, her face instantly brightened. “Song. ”   After waving and calling out to He Song,   Su Yan immediately came running over.   As He Song looked over, a flash of divine light flickered in his eyes.   He was then astonished to realize that Su Yan’s cultivation had actually reached the fourth-tier of Qi Refining.   Upon seeing this, a touch of surprise flashed in He Song’s eyes, but he immediately realized something.   It had been a full eight years since he last saw Su Yan.   In eight years, advancing from the first-tier Qi Refining to the fourth-tier was not astonishing in the least.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com   Even He Song himself had broken through from the first-tier to the fourth-tier of Qi Refining in just seven years.   Nevertheless, Su Yan’s progress in cultivation still impressed He Song.   His memories of the second meeting with Su Yan flashed in his mind.   Then, he glanced at Su Yan, whose appearance hadn’t changed at all, still looking like a young maiden, and He Song felt as if they were worlds apart. Successfully meeting Su Yan, He Song chatted with her for a while.   He also gave her advice on some matters she casually mentioned.   It was like this until several days later.   He Song bid farewell to Su Yan and Zhao Lin, leaving the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   One day later.   He Song’s figure appeared in the Green Wall Immortal City.   Since he had time after meeting with Zhao Lin, He Song wanted to visit Green Wall Immortal City and personally thank Master Qingyue, Ping’er, and Chu Shuangshuang.   When he first joined the Thick Earth Sect, it wouldn’t have been possible for him and Wei Fan to have the Foundation Establishment Elixirs they held now without Master Qingyue’s kind words.   Although the Foundation Establishment Elixirs were given by the Sect Leader, they were greatly related to Master Qingyue as well.   Therefore.   Whenever he had some free time, He Song would visit Green Wall Immortal City to express his gratitude in person.   Master Qingyue had been guarding Green Wall Immortal City for a long time, so to find her, naturally, He Song had to come here.   After entering Green Wall Immortal City and selecting three valuable gifts, He Song finally paid a visit.   These three gifts cost him a total of 1,500 spirit stones.   1,000 spirit stones worth of gifts were for Master Qingyue, of course.   The remaining 500 spirit stones were split into two parts, one for Ping’er and the other for Chu Shuangshuang.   Although 1, 500 spirit stones worth of gifts could not compare to even a single Foundation Establishment Elixir, it could still be considered as a token of appreciation..

Chapter 140: Chapter 139: Qj Refining 8th Layer   Translator: 549690339   With his wealth all laid out, three years had passed, and He Song had only a few spirit stones left.   It was believed that taking out all of his assets to buy gifts to thank the three of them should not seem too stingy.   Perhaps, it could even earn him some goodwill.   He Song arrived at Master Qing Yues residence.   After revealing his identity as a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, He Song was respectfully welcomed into the residence by the servants.   Passing through various corridors, he arrived at a deeper part of the residence.   He Song met the three of them in a small pavilion in a flower garden.   Junior He Song, greets Master Qing Yue and my two senior sisters.   He Song personally thanked Master Qing Yue, Pinger, and Chu Shuangshuang for their gifts.   Master Qing Yue did not make any noticeable response.   However, after looking at He Songs gift, her gaze slightly softened, and her tone changed accordingly   Perhaps, she saw the value of the gift and had some understanding of He Songs earnings.   Therefore, she regarded He Song more highly.   Or perhaps, she approved of He Songs act of personally coming to express his gratitude.   Pinger, who stood behind her, was somewhat infatuated with He Songs gifts, constantly looking at them with a pleased expression.   On receiving her gift, Chu Shuangshuangs face showed a rare hint of uncertainty, as if she hadnt expected to receive a gift as well.   After expressing his gratitude, Master Qing Yue let He Song stay in Green Wall Immortal City for several days.   During these days, Pinger and Chu Shuangshuang would occasionally accompany He Song, leading him on random strolls through Green Wall Immortal City.   Resigning to this, He Song abandoned his original plan of heading to the North City Entertainment District for music and followed the two of them everywhere they went.   Since his enjoyable stay at the ordinary residence in the north of Green Wall Immortal City, He Song had begun to like the place.   However, as the timing wasnt right, He Song decided to give up on this tempting idea.   Fortunately, the two of them were good-looking, and it was quite enjoyable to go out with them.   Days passed quickly.    He Song managed to find his former neighbor, Lin Cong, in Green Wall Immortal City while taking a break from his busy schedule.   Lin Cong had been He Songs neighbor for many years when he first arrived in this world. During the major upheaval in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, He Song foresaw the impending crisis and advised him to leave as soon as possible.   Without hesitation, Lin Cong listened to He Songs advice and left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion right away.   Since then, Lin Cong, a loose cultivator, embarked on his journey to Green Wall Immortal City.   Time flew by, and more than a decade had passed in the blink of an eye.   The once brawny, fierce-looking Lin Cong who seemingly wasnt easy to disturb had already settled down in Green Wall Immortal City.   Moreover, his cultivation level had improved from the fourth-tier of Qi Refining when he left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to the sixth-tier Qi Refining now.   Fortunately, throughout the years, He Song and Lin Cong had kept in touch.   Now they had some free time, the two had a good chat together.   They reminisced about their days in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   However, He Song did not tell Lin Cong about his current status as a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   Although there was no need to hide it, the change in He Songs identity could make Lin Cong, a mere loose cultivator, feel immense pressure.   Therefore, He Song didnt mention it.   Instead, he reconnected with Lin Cong and continued strolling around Green Wall Immortal City with Pinger and Chu Shuangshuang.   Several more days passed, and when He Song felt that the time was right, he left Green Wall Immortal City and headed back to the Thick Earth Sect in haste.   During this month-long experience outside the sect, He Song accomplished quite a bit.   From the destruction of the spirit field, killing Chen Zhong, finding a new valley to establish a spirit field, selling spirit rice at the Flowers Immortal Pavilion and laundering stolen goods,   Immortal Pavilion and looking for Su Yan,   and finally, coming to Green Wall Immortal City to personally express gratitude to Master Qing Yue, Pinger, and Chu Shuangshuang as well as finding Lin Cong.   All of these events were accomplished within just over a month.   However, after returning to the Thick Earth Sect in just over ten days, He Song immediately started his seclusive cultivation.   At this point, He Song was already quite close to reaching the eighth-tier of Qi Refining.   Under such circumstances, it was better to focus on cultivation and reach the eighth-tier of Qi Refining before venturing out again.   By that time, his strength would naturally have significantly improved.   Time flew by.    In the blink of an eye, He Song had cultivated within the Thick Earth Sect for a full two years.   During these two years, apart from going to the valley thousands of miles away to replenish the spirit stones for the Array Skills of the newly established spirit field, He Song never stepped out of his small courtyard.   Within the Thick Earth Sect, there were specialized personnel who would deliver meals to each occupied courtyard.   The rice was spirit rice, the meat was demonic beast meat, and all the other ingredients were spiritual materials.   It could be said that even a single meal within the Thick Earth Sect would cost several or even more than a dozen spirit stones if it were to be obtained outside.   However, within the Thick Earth Sect, these things were supplied infinitely.   The outer disciples of the Thick Earth Sect only needed to focus on cultivation and had no need to worry about other matters.   After all, they were the hope of the sect, and they would be the cornerstones of the sects future.   As long as there were continuously Foundation Establishment Masters emerging, the resources spent would be considered insignificant.   Of course, the Thick Earth Sect also had external tasks available.   If disciples felt that their annual salary was insufficient, they could take up external tasks to earn spirit stones and contributions.   Sect contributions could be used to exchange for some unique items within the sect.   Spirit stones could also be used to purchase contributions, with an exchange rate of 150 spirit stones for one contribution point.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎   He Song had not taken up any external tasks since joining the sect and only had limited knowledge about them.   Today.   He Song sat on the meditation cushion in his courtyard, with the spirit power in his body rapidly circulating, gradually refining the spirit Qi from the surroundings into his spirit power.   At a certain moment, when the spirit power within his body had accumulated to a certain degree, He Song felt his body suddenly lighten, and the illusion of an intense surge in strength was felt at this moment.   Breakthrough, eighth-tier of Qi Refining!   Just after breaking through, He Song didnt rush to leave his seclusive cultivation, instead continuing to absorb the surrounding spirit Qi and transform it into his spirit power.   It wasnt until several days later, when He Songs aura had stabilized, and his cultivation had solidified at the eighth-tier of Qi Refining, that he finally opened his eyes.   In five years, Ive reached the eighth-tier of Qi Refining. With my current cultivation speed, Ill probably reach the great perfection of Qi Refining in just   over a decade, and by then   Calculating the time in his heart, He Song remembered the scene of Meng Guan successfully breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Stage.   That vortex of spirit Qi, neither large nor small.   The intense spiritual pressure that came with the breakthrough.   And the sudden changes in his identity and strength that followed the breakthrough.   All made He Song yearn for the same..bender

Chapter 141: Chapter 140: Attempting Foundation Establishment   Translator: 549690339   Foundation Establishment   Murmuring the words Foundation Establishment, He Song felt a surge of excitement as he took stock of his own strength.   At his current pace of cultivation   Foundation Establishment was only about a decade away.   It seemed   It was time for him to source more Foundation Establishment Elixirs.bender   With that thought flashing through his mind, He Song let out a sigh, his face suddenly adopting a somewhat helpless expression.   The Foundation Establishment Elixir is a hard thing to come by!   The only Foundation Establishment Elixir he had on hand was obtained entirely by chance.   Moreover, since he had arrived here from another world, he had never heard of the elixir being found anywhere.   You could say   Before he joined the Thick Earth Sect, He Song only knew of the existence of the Foundation Establishment Elixir, but he had no idea if it would ever appear.   Not to mention ordinary elixir shops   Even at auctions   He Song had never seen a Foundation Establishment Elixir.   However   Just as He Song was pondering where he could get more Foundation Establishment Elixirs   The Sound Transmission Amulet he had placed next to him was starting to glow slightly.   A Sound Transmission Amulet could not receive messages when stored in a storage bag.   Thus, most cultivators would only keep it in their storage bag if they anticipated danger or were in seclusion. Otherwise, they would keep it hanging on their waist or close by.   As He Song was cultivating in the Thick Earth Sect, he naturally kept his Sound Transmission Amulet close by.   He quickly noticed the amulets unusual activity and picked it up   He Song activated it.   Immediately, he saw a thin sheet of paper inside the amulet.   The paper was covered with writing.   Mr. He, after years of cultivation, I have finally reached the state of Qi Refining Great Perfection.   Counting the days, I am now 57 years old, leaving me little more than two years till sixty.   The breakthrough to Foundation Establishment cant be delayed.   If youre free, why not drop by my courtyard.   Wei Fan.   After reading the message, He Song stowed the paper away in his storage bag and furrowed his brows in thought. Just over two years left till sixty?   Just over?   A little more than two years?   Thats enough time for Wei Fan to have several more sons. isnt it?            Such a long period of time, why the urgency in his message?   Why?   After pondering for a bit, a light bulb went on in He Songs head.   Could it be   Understanding flashed through He Songs eyes momentarily.   He no longer had any doubts about the purpose of Wei Fans message.   Foundation Establishment Elixir.   It can increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com   At the same time, it enables cultivators who have suffered serious injuries from unsuccessful Foundation Establishment attempts to fully recover within two years and have another shot at Foundation Establishment.   Currently, Wei Fan is 57 years old. In just over two years, he will be sixty.   In other words, Wei Fan wants to attempt Foundation Establishment within this time window with the help of the Foundation Establishment Elixir.   If he succeeds   Then he succeeds.   If he fails   Then, having attempted Foundation Establishment with the help of an elixir, he will have another chance at Foundation Establishment two years later.   In two years, Wei Fan will be 59, just a little more than sixty.   However, that is enough time for him to attempt Foundation Establishment again.   This way, Wei Fan effectively gains two chances at Foundation Establishment.   Once he came to this understanding, He Song had more clarity in his heart.   It seems that Weis chance of successfully reaching Foundation Establishment is much higher than old Mengs. Even the number of attempts at Foundation Establishment is one more.   However, this method is only useful for cultivators like Wei Fan, who have Foundation Establishment Elixirs and are not too old yet.   If one reached the state of Qi Refining Great Perfection at the age exceeding fifty-eight   Or didnt have any Foundation Establishment Elixirs but only Vein Protection Elixirs, they would not have two chances at Foundation Establishment.   Even though Vein Protection Elixirs can save a cultivators life   It does take a full ten years to fully recover.   Thats way too long.   So long that most cultivators cant afford to wait that long.   Only He Song, with his endless lifespan, could think of repeatedly attempting Foundation Establishment with Vein Protection Elixirs until he eventually succeeded.   Getting up   He deactivated his array skills   He Song opened the gate of his courtyard and headed straight towards Wei Fans courtyard.   Just as he arrived outside Wei Fans courtyard, he saw the courtyard gate swing open.   Wei Fans hearty laughter echoed out.   Congratulations, congratulations, congrats on breaking through to the eighth-tier of Qi Refining.   As his laughter sounded, He Song stepped into the courtyard, waving his hands and replying as he did so.   Not at all, not at all. I should be congratulating you, Wei, on reaching the state of Qi Refining Great Perfection. Your Foundation Establishment seems likely.            Having said that, He Song moved a few steps forward and quickly took a seat next to Wei Fan.   Only when Wei Fan began to pour tea for him did He Song speak once more. Wei, are you sure about your Foundation Establishment attempt this time?   Among their circle of three, Meng Guan was the first to attempt Foundation Establishment, and he succeeded.   Wei Fan had also reached the state of Qi Refining Great Perfection, so it wouldnt be long before he started his own attempt at Foundation Establishment.   However, He Song was unsure about how confident Wei Fan was.   As of now, he had only attained the eighth-tier of Qi Refining, and Foundation Establishment was still a while away.   So, he wasnt in a rush.   Theres no certainty to these things. You make human efforts and let nature take its course.   Faced with He Songs question, Wei Fan shook his head, uncertain himself.   After all, ever since he had broken through to the seventh-tier Qi Refining, he knew that he would someday have to attempt Foundation Establishment on his own.   But man proposes, God disposes.   Just as he had been gradually inching towards Foundation Establishment   The appearance of Meng Guan gave him a great push, moving his Foundation Establishment date significantly forward.   Now, he even had the Foundation Establishment Elixir ready.   Yet   Foundation Establishment isnt an easy task.   Even with all his preparations, Wei Fan still felt unsure.   Thus, when asked about his chances by He Song, his response was to let nature take its course.   Seeing Wei Fans response, He Song decided not to probe any further.   He only let out a sigh in his heart before changing the topic of conversation.   Topics such as Meng Guan, who was still in seclusion   Various matters within the Thick Earth Sect   A visit to Green Wall Immortal City a couple years back to personally express his gratitude to Master Qingy Yue   A return to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, walking along its many streets   And so on   Faced with his friend who was about to attempt Foundation Establishment, He Song could only use such topics to soothe him and ensure he wouldnt be too anxious and mess up his efforts.   As for the rest   There were no more ways he could help.   Like this   A few days later   Wei Fan bid He Song farewell and, entering the meditation room in his own little courtyard alone, began his attempt at Foundation Establishment.   As for He Song   He continued to stand guard in Wei Fans courtyard to be safe.   Although they were in the Thick Earth Sect and didnt need to worry about any dangers   You could still never be too cautious.   Having a trustworthy friend to watch over him would surely give Wei Fan more   peace of mind..            

Chapter 142: Chapter 141: Foundation Establishment Failure   Translator: 549690339   Several days passed in the blink of an eye.   He Song, having had the experience of guarding someone else’s cultivation before, did not find it boring.   The Thick Earth Sect provided everything needed for outer disciples in their courtyards.   In these few days, besides occasionally checking the entrance to the quiet room, He Song spent most of his time immersed in studying the Array Tao Primary Introduction.   He had joined the Thick Earth Sect five years ago, becoming an outer disciple and selecting the Array Tao Primary Introduction from the Book Collection Pavilion.   Over these five years, He Song had been constantly studying the Array Tao Primary Introduction, making rapid progress.   However, even so, he still had not successfully laid out even the simplest array skill recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com  The array skills recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction are more numerous and complicated than those in the Array Tao Introduction.   The knowledge of array tao within is also more profound.   However, since there are more array skills to learn, He Song no longer needs to study every single one.   He can learn the array skills recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction according to his own interests.   Those he doesn’t want to learn, he naturally doesn’t need to study.   For example, He Song was currently studying the simplest array skill recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction, called the Small Spirit-Gathering Array.   According to the description in the Array Tao Primary Introduction, the Spirit-Gathering Array recorded in the Array Tao Introduction is just an entry-level Miniature Spirit Gathering Array.   It has a small coverage area, and the gathered spirit Qi is relatively thin.   Meanwhile, the Small Spirit-Gathering Array recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction is an advanced version of the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array.   To set up the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array, one only needs to inscribe array patterns on spirit stones, which would create the Array Foundation.   But the Small Spirit-Gathering Array is different.   The Small Spirit-Gathering Array requires refining Array Banners and an Array Disk, then using a special method to control them, placing them in specific positions, and finally activating the array with a secret skill.   Because of the different array patterns carriers, the Small Spirit-Gathering Array’s power is naturally greater than that of the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array.   At the same time, arrays set up using Array Banners and an Array Disk are naturally much more potent than entry-level arrays.   Moreover, since Array Banners and Array Disks are harder to destroy, the chances of the array being forcibly broken are greatly reduced.   It can be said that the array skills recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction are far more powerful than the entry-level arrays recorded in the Array Tao Introduction.   At the same time, the required materials and the profound knowledge involved are not comparable to entry-level array skills.   It is for these reasons that He Song has been immersed in the study of the   Array Tao Primary Introduction for the past five years.    As for setting up a real array, he must wait until he has learned the layout method of the Small Spirit-Gathering Array and the refining methods for Array Banners and Array Disks.   Then he can leave the sect to search for the materials needed to refine Array Banners and Array Disks, and begin crafting them.   It is not until that time when he can set up an array.   Just like this, several more days passed.   On one day, He Song was studying the Array Tao Primary Introduction, when out of the corner of his eye, he suddenly noticed the door to Wei Fan’s quiet room open.   Before He Song could react, a figure stumbled out and fell to the ground with a thud.   Seeing this, He Song immediately rushed over and helped the fallen Wei Fan up.   “Wei?”   After helping Wei Fan sit down, He Song’s heart sank.   This was… a Foundation Establishment failure!   There was no formation of a spirit Qi vortex, nor the intense spiritual pressure that would appear after advancing to Foundation Establishment.   When Wei Fan stepped out of the quiet room, his face was extremely pale, and the next moment he fell to the ground, barely able to stand.   If he had not seen that Wei Fan had no visible injuries, He Song would have thought that he had been attacked.   But, how could someone have bypassed him when he was clearly guarding outside?   Therefore.   He Song only thought about it for a bit, and then understood what happened.   Wei Fan, first attempt at Foundation Establishment.   Failure!   Sitting on the side, a few breaths later.   Wei Fan’s originally pale face finally seemed somewhat better.   However, seeing the worried expression on He Song’s face in front of him, Wei Fan’s lips can’t help but form a bitter smile.   “Sigh, I truly experienced how hard this Foundation Establishment bottleneck is today.”   “Difficult, difficult, difficult!”   “As difficult as climbing to the sky!”   Shaking his head, a hint of panic flashed in Wei Fan’s eyes. It seemed as if he recalled something terrifying, causing his body to tremble for a moment. Seeing this, He Song’s face changed slightly, and he felt a sudden shadow in his heart.   Is Foundation Establishment really that difficult?   Why is Wei Fan so panicked about his failed Foundation Establishment this time?   What did he experience during these days?    And what caused his Foundation Establishment to fail this time?   A doubt flashed through his mind. He Song’s gaze towards Wei Fan also carried a trace of inquiry.   Before today.   Although He Song always thought that Foundation Establishment was hard, extremely hard.   However, with Meng Guan’s successful Foundation Establishment as a precedent, He Song actually began to underestimate Foundation Establishment.   With his unlimited lifespan and immortality.   Breaking through Foundation Establishment, no matter how difficult, there would always be a day to break through.   Even if he had to wait ten years after a failure to make another breakthrough attempt.   But as long as he didn’t die, his Foundation Establishment breakthrough would be inevitable.   But now.   Seeing Wei Fan’s strong panic after his failed Foundation Establishment and even trembling,   He Song had a deeper understanding of the difficulty of Foundation Establishment.   “Wei, did you encounter something?”   Handing Wei Fan a cup of tea, He Song took the opportunity to ask while Wei raised his teacup.   Wanting to know what Wei Fan experienced.   Asking directly would be the best method.   On the side.   Wei Fan, who just picked up the teacup and was about to take a sip.   Upon hearing He Song’s inquiry, he couldn’t help but recall everything he had experienced before.   His body unconsciously shivered again.   “It’s basically the same as what Lao Meng said before, but… if one fails to condense mana, their spirit power will scatter and attack their body.”   “Without a life-saving elixir, when spirit power scatters, it’s the moment when cultivators die.’   “If I hadn’t had the Foundation Establishment Elixir to save my life this time, I’m afraid I would have already died.”   There was a flash of fear in Wei Fan’s eyes, and as he spoke, he subconsciously looked towards his Elixir Field’s location.   At this time, although he seemed uninjured on the surface, his body was already filled with hidden injuries.   During the Foundation Establishment breakthrough, spirit power was compressed in his Elixir Field, and the birth of mana occurred there as well.   The spirit Qi wreaked havoc inside the body when spirit power scattered.   If it weren’t for the Foundation Establishment Elixir’s medicinal power to rapidly heal the injuries, the consequences would have been unthinkable.   At this moment, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief internally.   At the same time, he felt great admiration for Meng Guan, who only took a Vein Protection Elixir and successfully broke through without the Foundation Establishment Elixir.   It’s important to know that.   Lao Meng initially wanted to start his Foundation Establishment breakthrough without even taking the Vein Protection Elixir..

Chapter 143: Chapter 142: Meng Guan ‘s Arrival   Translator: 549690339   If it weren’t for the small auction that took place later, where He Song and Wei Fan managed to borrow some spirit stones to buy the Vein Protection Elixir, he might not have even been able to get one.   And under these circumstances,   Meng Guan managed to achieve Foundation Establishment success.   It can simply be considered a miracle.   You need to know.   During his attempt at Foundation Establishment, he not only consumed a Foundation Establishment Elixir, which increases the rate of success, but also knew about Meng Guan’s experience with Foundation Establishment.   Even with these two factors, breaking through to Foundation Establishment was still extremely difficult for him.   Compared to Meng Guan’s successful Foundation Establishment, he felt a hint of epiphany in his heart.   In his opinion,   The reason Lao Meng was able to establish his foundation was due largely to luck.   Meanwhile,   He Song nodded thoughtfully after listening to his words. If one tried to establish their foundation without a life-saving elixir,   Failing could result in serious injuries or even death on the spot.   This is not a joke,   But the truth.   Only by taking a Vein Protection Elixir or a Foundation Establishment Elixir can one avoid such a fate and save their life.   However, even if one consumes these elixirs, it will take a long time for the injuries to heal completely.   This is why it takes two years to attempt breakthrough again after failing with the Foundation Establishment Elixir.   “It seems I am a step late.”   As the two were talking, a voice suddenly came from outside the courtyard.   The two looked over and saw Meng Guan standing at the entrance of the courtyard, his eyes fixed on Wei Fan.   Seeing it was Meng Guan, He Song waved his hand, and the array setup in the courtyard was immediately closed, and the courtyard door opened.   When Meng Guan entered the courtyard, He Song activated the Array Skills again and closed the door.   Approaching Wei Fan,   Meng Guan carefully observed Wei Fan’s condition and then sighed in relief.   “Having taken the Foundation Establishment Elixir, there should be no major issues. After two years of recuperation, you can try again.”   “I must admit, the Foundation Establishment method is too profound. Even after five years, I have barely learned one. I missed Wei’s day of Foundation Establishment, and I hope you won’t blame me.”    Meng Guan said with a salute to the two.   Even after breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, the way the three addressed each other hadn’t changed.   Although Wei Fan had mentioned it before, Meng Guan said he didn’t mind it.   Thus, even though Meng Guan had already established his foundation, he still addressed Wei as Wei.   Long-standing habits don’t change easily.   “Lao Meng, you shouldn’t blame yourself. It’s me who wasted a Foundation Establishment Elixir, and I feel ashamed.”   Seeing Meng Guan saluting him, Wei Fan’s face flashed a hint of embarrassment.   The Foundation Establishment Elixir in his hand had come from Meng Guan.   Now that his first attempt at Foundation Establishment had failed and he had used up the only Foundation Establishment Elixir he had, he felt even more ashamed when he saw Meng Guan.   Meng Guan successfully established his foundation without a Foundation Establishment Elixir.   Although he believed luck played a significant role,   When it came to his own breakthrough,   He had Meng Guan’s personal Foundation Establishment experience and the Foundation Establishment Elixir that Meng Guan had personally given him to help. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com  Moreover, he had the four Spirits Root.   But… despite all this, his first attempt to break through the Foundation Establishment stage still failed.   If he hadn’t had a Foundation Establishment Elixir to protect him, he would have been dead by now.   This disparity made it difficult for Wei Fan to accept.   Now seeing Meng Guan, he felt even more embarrassed.   “No need to worry, it’s just one Foundation Establishment Elixir. Now that I’ve reached Foundation Establishment, it’s not as difficult to obtain as it was during the Qi Refining stage. You don’t have to be like this.”   Meng Guan waved his hand, signaling Wei Fan not to worry.   However, while speaking, Meng Guan quickly started calculating in his heart.   Foundation Establishment Elixirs   Are generally stored in the sect’s treasure vault, and when they appear there, disciples with contributions or Foundation Establishment elders can exchange them at any time.   However, they are quite valuable.   To exchange for a Foundation Establishment Elixir, you need a full hundred contribution points.   Based on the exchange rate of one contribution point equaling 150 spirit stones,   Converting to spirit stones, a Foundation Establishment Elixir would cost 15,000 spirit stones.   This is just the internal price.   If sold outside, it would probably cost at least 20,000 or even higher.    An outer disciple completing tasks for a year can only earn five contribution points.   Moreover, in the sect, obtaining anything requires contributions.   Cultivation skills, elixirs, Artifacts, and so on.   If you want these, you need to exchange for them with contribution points.   Thus, for a Qi Refining disciple, it’s extremely difficult to accumulate contribution points to exchange for a Foundation Establishment Elixir.   Even though outer disciples receive an annual salary of 500 spirit stones, which can be used to exchange for contribution points,   At most, they can only earn eight contribution points a year by calculating with 150 spirit stones per point.   Plus, there are regular expenses for learning Array Skills, buying elixirs, and Artifacts, etc.   Trying to accumulate a hundred contribution points to exchange for a Foundation Establishment Elixir is quite difficult.   However, once they break through to Foundation Establishment and become a Foundation Establishment elder, it will no longer be so difficult. Foundation Establishment elders,   Can earn 20 contribution points from tasks completed in a year.   At the same time, each Foundation Establishment elder receives an annual salary of 3,000 spirit stones.   If the annual salary of 3,000 spirit stones is also used to exchange for contribution points, they can get a total of 40 contribution points a year.   In just three years, they can exchange for a Foundation Establishment Elixir from the sect’s treasure vault.   This is also why Ping’er said that with a Foundation Establishment friend or Master, the chance of reaching Foundation Establishment increases greatly.   For Foundation Establishment Masters, the Foundation Establishment Elixir is not that precious.   Of course,   It’s much easier for the Thick Earth Sect’s outer disciples to obtain a Foundation Establishment Elixir than it is for loose cultivators.   They can seek a Foundation Establishment Master as their mentor,   Or work hard to accumulate contribution points to exchange for a Foundation   Establishment Elixir,   Or even befriend a Foundation Establishment elder, which may lead to unexpected gains.   For the disciples of the Thick Earth Sect,   The chances of getting a Foundation Establishment Elixir are undoubtedly much greater than for ordinary loose cultivators.   But,   Three years to save up a Foundation Establishment Elixir,   This speed may seem fast,   But… it seems Wei Fan doesn’t have that much time.   Wei Fan is now already 57 years old, and in three years, he will be over 60. Moreover, he only needs two years to recover from his injuries,   Which means that he needs another Foundation Establishment Elixir within two years so that he can still use one for his next attempt.   After carefully calculating, Meng Guan couldn’t help but feel a bit embarrassed.   “It’s just… I used all my annual salary for daily cultivation and purchasing high-quality Artifacts, so I’m afraid I won’t be able to save enough for a Foundation Establishment Elixir in two years..”

Chapter 144 - 144: 143: Wei Fan Seeks Help Translator: 549690339   It had been five years since Meng Guan joined the Thick Earth Sect.   As a Foundation Establishment Master, Meng Guan received an annual salary of three thousand spirit stones, making a total of fifteen thousand spirit stones in five years.   Foundation Establishment Masters were unlike outer disciples.   Foundation Establishment Masters only had annual salaries and none of the other items used to increase their cultivation.   For example, elixirs, Crumbled Jade Powder, and so on were exclusive to outer disciples.   Therefore, if one wanted to obtain high-quality artifacts, skills, elixirs and so on, they could only buy them with their annual salary.   Alternatively, they could take on external affairs and exchange them with contribution points.   Meng Guan, as a Foundation Establishment Master, had spent a total of several thousand spirit stones in these five years.   He had recently bought a high-quality defensive artifact, costing more than nine thousand spirit stones.   In short, Meng Guan had spent all of his five-year annual salary.   Now, facing Wei Fan who will start his foundation building in two years and has no Foundation Establishment Elixir reserves. Menc Guan was financiallv embarrassed at this moment.   Even if he took on external affairs for two years and used all the spirit stones earned in two years to exchange for contribution points, he would only get eighty contribution points in two years, still short of twenty points.   According to the exchange rate of one contribution point per one hundred and fifty spirit stones,   There was still a shortage of about three thousand spirit stones.   On the side,   Wei Fan, who was unaware of all this, was overjoyed when he heard Meng Guan’s words.   Regardless of his serious injuries,   He hastily stood up and bowed deeply to Meng Guan and He Song.   He then requested help,   “Although I don’t have many spirit stones left on me, I still have two years left to save up.”   “I don’t know if it’s enough or not. If it’s not enough, please help me, my two friends. I don’t want to miss this last opportunity to establish my foundation.”   “If I really can establish my foundation successfully, I will never forget your great kindness.”   “Even if I fail to establish my foundation, I will do my best to return these spirit stones as soon as possible.”   Wei Fan beseeched Meng Guan and He Song with a determined look on his face.   Today,   He had already wasted a Foundation Establishment Elixir and a chance to establish his foundation.   If he could not get another Foundation Establishment Elixir in the next two years, his chances of establishing his foundation would become extremely slim.   In such a situation, asking his two good friends for help was not something too hard to accept.   After all, Meng Guan had started asking for help like this five years ago.   In their small circle of three, when someone was in trouble, the other two would help as long as it did not affect themselves.   Just like when he helped He Song and escorted Meng Guan and lent spirit stones to Meng Guan to help him buy the Vein Protection Elixir.    However,   He used to be in the position of helping others before.   Now that he was asking for help himself, he was naturally a little nervous.   “Brother Wei, there is no need to be like this; let’s first listen to how much spirit stones are missing and try to gather them. We should be able to gather enough,” He Song comforted him while Meng Guan looked at each other and helped him up together.   As for Wei Fan,   Both Meng Guan and He Song had considerable goodwill towards him.   That’s because both of them had received Wei Fan’s kindness before, and those kindnesses were not small.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎   He Song had encountered the Immortal Pavilion catastrophe during his Qi Refining Early Stage, and if not for Wei Fan’s protection, he wouldn’t have survived.   Furthermore, He had requested Wei Fan to boldly kill Chen Zhou, eliminating a major threat.   Meng Guan, when in his Qi Refining Mid Stage, had requested Wei Fan to escort him to the Green Wall Immortal City to buy Breakthrough Elixir, which helped him break through to the Qi Refining Late Stage.   Later, he personally asked Wei Fan and He Song to lend him spirit stones to buy the Vein Protection Elixir.   Under such circumstances,   Even if it’s just to return the favor, both of them would be willing to help.   Moreover, their small circle of three had a tradition of helping each other.   Now that Wei Fan had asked for help, the other two naturally wouldn’t refuse.   “You both might not know, but in the sect’s external affairs, Qi Refining disciples can get five contribution points and five hundred spirit stones in annual salary per year, while Foundation Establishment elders can get twenty contribution points and a three thousand spirit stone annual salary.”   “One hundred contribution points can be exchanged for a Foundation Establishment Elixir in the sect’s treasure house.”   “At the same time, one hundred and fifty spirit stones can be exchanged for one contribution point.”   “In this calculation, I can get eighty contribution points after two years of external affairs and two years of annual salary.”   “In this way, I still lack twenty contribution points, which is equivalent to three thousand spirit stones.”   Seeing He Song comforting Wei Fan, Meng Guan also took the opportunity to speak about this matter after both of them sat down.   The cost of exchanging for the Foundation Establishment Elixir should naturally be borne by him, the Foundation Establishment cultivator.   Even though this would slow down his cultivation progress in the Foundation Establishment Realm and he wouldn’t be able to do anything else for two years.   But since Wei Fan asked for help, he naturally wanted to give him a hand.   Wei Fan had already failed once and gained experience in building his foundation.   If he succeeded next time, it would also be of great benefit to him.   Two years’ time was worth the effort.   “Over the years, I used most of my annual salary to purchase elixirs for cultivation, and now I only have a little over three hundred spirit stones left”   “However, for the next two years, I can save my annual salary, which will amount to one thousand three hundred spirit stones.” Meanwhile, Wei Fan calculated the spirit stones he had on hand.   After finishing the calculation and informing the two of them.   Meng Guan and Wei Fan’s gazes turned to He Song.   They were short of three thousand spirit stones.   Wei Fan had already made up one thousand three hundred of them.    It was down to He Song.   He only needed to come up with one thousand seven hundred spirit stones, and this matter would be settled.   They just needed to wait two years, and Meng Guan would be able to exchange a Foundation Establishment Elixir from the sect’s treasure house for Wei Fan to try again.   Facing the gazes of the two, He Song gave a slight smile.   “If this is settled, I will use my annual salary for the next three years to buy gifts to personally thank Master Qingy Yue and her two disciples.” “For the past two years, I haven’t been using my salary.”   “Now, I still have over a thousand spirit stones.”   “There are still two years left, and in these two years, I can save another thousand spirit stones.”   “So, I have over two thousand spirit stones in hand.”   “Adding them all together, it shouldn’t be difficult to buy a Foundation Establishment Elixir.”   He Song’s words were both true and false.   The truth was that he indeed spent one thousand five hundred spirit stones to buy gifts and personally thanked Master Qingy Yue and her two disciples. The falsehood was that he currently had over ten thousand spirit stones on nana.   However, the source of so many spirit stones was indeed a problem.   That was the reason behind He Song’s half-truths.   In front of his good friends, it would be better to control his wealth to just enough to be helpful.   In this way, he could conceal his true self, help his friends, and not expose the source of the large number of spirit stones he possessed.   If Wei Fan managed to establish his foundation successfully in two years, he would probably remember the favor He Song did for him.   By just lending out a little over a thousand spirit stones and having such a great return, it was simply perfect.   On the side.   After hearing He Song’s words, the two of them visibly relaxed.   Then, the three of them looked at each other and laughed, smiles appearing on their faces.   “Alright, since it’s settled, Wei, you just focus on healing. I’ll go take on some external tasks.”   “See you in two years!”   After sitting for a while, Meng Guan took his leave first.   He Song naturally followed suit and left Wei Fan’s courtyard.   When he returned to his own courtyard,   He Song sat cross-legged on the cushion, his thoughts racing a million miles away.   “One Foundation Establishment Elixir for fifteen thousand spirit stones, huh? If I open up more spirit fields… This number of spirit stones should be achievable.”   “Even with six Foundation Establishment Elixirs, there’s still a chance.’   Recalling Meng Guan’s previous words about the price of exchanging Foundation Establishment Elixirs from the sect treasure house, He Song’s thoughts raced in his mind.   He Song currently had only one spirit field, producing three thousand spirit stones annually.   To use spirit stones to exchange for one hundred contribution points, and then use these one hundred contribution points to exchange for a Foundation   Establishment Elixir ,   He would need a total of fifteen thousand spirit stones.   That is to say, one Foundation Establishment Elixir would take five years for He Song to save up.   The time seemed a bit long.   But if He Song had multiple spirit fields….

Chapter 145 - 145: 144: High-Quality Spirit Artifacts Translator: 549690339   “It seems that I need to find more places to open spirit fields.”   With a flash of brilliance in his eyes, He Song looked outside the Thick Earth Sect.   Now.   It had been 27 years since He Song had arrived in this world.   In these 27 years.   He Song had successfully cultivated from a first-tier Qi Refining practitioner to the current eighth-tier of Qi Refining.   When he had just arrived in this world, his previous body was 18 years old.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com   Eighteen plus twenty-seven.   The current He Song.   Was already a full forty-five years old.   According to He Song’s own calculations, it would take him another ten or so years to reach the stage of Qi Refining great perfection.   At such a pace.   It should be enough to reach the stage of Qi Refining great perfection before the age of sixty.   Perhaps, with plenty of time to spare.   However.   He only had fifteen years left before reaching the age of sixty.   It would be quite difficult to get at least five more Foundation Establishment Elixirs within these fifteen years.   If he doesn’t open new spirit fields.   In these fifteen years, at most, he could only get three Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   It would be extremely difficult to give it his all and take six Foundation Establishment Elixirs to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Although He Song, as an everlasting being, would not be affected by his age even after he turned sixty.   However, He Song still had to consider the feelings of others.   A practitioner with four spirits roots who “luckily” broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm on the eve of their sixtieth birthday.   Such an event would attract some attention, but not too much.   The vast majority of practitioners would only envy it for a moment, and then put it out of their minds.   But if a practitioner with four spirits roots broke through to the Foundation Establishment in their sixties or even seventies.   Once such a thing happened, it would cause quite a stir.   At that time, countless practitioners would focus their gaze on He Song.    By then, every move He Song made would attract the attention of other practitioners.   Even when he went out in the future, others would remember his name when asked.   After all, it would be difficult not to attract attention as a practitioner who broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage in their sixties or seventies.   As for this kind of scenario.   He Song simply could not accept it.   Hiding himself, not letting others notice him, being an ordinary passerby, was the life that He Song pursued.   This was the Cultivation World.   He had also heard of techniques such as the Soul Searching Skill.   If an Ancestor Yuanying or a Golden Elixir Master became interested in him, his fate would undoubtedly be very miserable.   Therefore, breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before the age of sixty was the most important matter for He Song to consider.   Of course.   If he really couldn’t break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before the age of sixty, He Song would have no choice but to leave this place and succeed in breaking through the Foundation Establishment Realm in a strange place where no one knew his age.   In that case.   As no one would recognize him, he would be free to claim whatever age he wanted without raising any suspicions.   However, unless absolutely necessary, He Song would never do such a thing.   Under the rule of the Thick Earth Sect, his foundation had been established, his background was deep, and he even had the support of a Foundation Establishment Master, who was almost untouchable.   Abandoning such a foundation to go somewhere else.   It would be absolutely impossible unless there was no other choice.   In the small courtyard, He Song’s gaze became increasingly resolute.   To break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before the age of sixty, he needed to have enough spirit stones.   And in order to have more spirit stones, with his means, he could only quickly open new spirit fields and plant more spirit rice to gain them.   so.   “Let’s set off then, open up more spirit fields, and if the first attempt at breaking through to the Foundation Establishment fails, perhaps there will be a second chance to try again.”   After secretly making up his mind, He Song’s figure also left his small courtyard.   Stepping out of the Thick Earth Sect.   He Song looked back and sighed in his heart, then immediately used the Wind Riding Skill, turning into an arrow leaving the bowstring, shooting forward rapidly.   After experiencing Wei Fan’s first failed attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, He Song subconsciously wanted to leave himself a backup plan.   According to his thoughts.   He should be able to have a second chance at Foundation Establishment, just like Wei Fan.   Fifteen years.    From the eighth-tier of Qi Refining to the Qi Refining great perfection.   As long as he worked hard cultivating, used all kinds of things to improve his cultivation, he could definitely squeeze out two years, or even more time, to reach Qi Refining great perfection before the age of fifty-eight.   By then, he would have a second chance at Foundation Establishment.   Even if the first attempt at Foundation Establishment failed, he would still have a second chance at Foundation Establishment.   With the two added together, He Song’s chances of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before the age of sixty would greatly increase.   However, as he sped forward, He Song also remembered the Sect treasury that Ping’er had introduced to him when he had first joined.   Years ago.   When He Song had just joined, he had heard Ping’er talk about the Sect treasury.   The Sect treasury.   It was not a warehouse, nor was it a palace.   It had no elders guarding it, nor disciples watching over it.   Instead, it was a huge mountain peak.   At this moment, this huge mountain peak stood in the center of the Thick Earth Sect, serving as the main peak of the Sect.   This was a high -quality spirit artifact.   Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment practitioners used Artifacts.   Golden Elixir and Yuanying practitioners used spirit artifacts.   Artifacts could be controlled with spirit power or mana, and could be used as an extension of one’s arm, but they were ultimately just inanimate objects.   Spirit artifacts, on the other hand, could move with one’s thoughts. Under the control of one’s divine sense, all one needed to do was to think, and they could move as one wished, making them more compatible with practitioners.   This high-quality spirit artifact was refined by an Ancestor Yuanying of the Thick Earth Sect for the purpose of guarding the Sect.   Thick Earth Sect.   From the founding of the Sect, it was a Golden Core Sect. Even today, it was still a Golden Core Sect.   However, ten thousand years ago, the Thick Earth Sect once had an Ancestor Yuanying.   For a time, the Sect was promoted to the Nascent Soul Sect, and there was no one else like it.   However, later on, with the decline of its foundation, it fell from the Nascent Soul Sect and once again returned to being a Golden Core Sect.   This high-quality spirit artifact, called the Mountain Seal, was refined by that Ancestor Yuanying and left in the Sect to serve as a foundation.   This high-quality spirit artifact appeared as if it had been chopped with a knife and ax, with horizontal and vertical lines.   This was also the reason why the mountain peaks within the Thick Earth Sect had such a shape.   At the same time, due to the space within the Mountain Seal and its extraordinary sturdiness, it naturally served as both a foundation and the treasury of the Sect.   Because of its high-quality spirit artifact status, and the fact that the current Sect Leader’s cultivation had reached the Golden Elixir Stage, he was naturally capable of controlling the spirit artifact.   With this quality and spirit, it was treated as the treasury of the Sect.   Outer disciples, or Foundation Establishment Masters, only needed to go to the main peak, communicate with the Mountain Seal through their thoughts, and they could exchange spirit stones for contributions, or use contributions to exchange for the items they wanted.   Although the spirit artifact had spirit, it was ultimately just a spirit artifact, and its spiritual intelligence was not high.   Even if He Song were to exchange all the Foundation Establishment Elixirs in it, it wouldn’t attract the attention of the Mountain Seal..

Chapter 146 - 146: 145: Hundred Acres of Spirit Field Translator: 549690339   Only after others subsequently came to exchange for the Foundation Establishment Elixir and discovered that they were all taken, would the news be spread.   However, even if the news gets out, it probably won’t alarm the Sect Leader.   Sect Leader oversees the Mountain Seal, but he does not involve himself in everything. The Mountain Seal’s spiritual wisdom is not high and is only responsible for exchange matters. Even if the Sect Leader is alarmed, he wouldn’t be able to find out that it was He Song.   Consequently, earning spirit stones to exchange for Foundation Establishment Elixirs carries no risk at all.   It is just unknown whether the Foundation Establishment Elixirs in the Mountain Seal would be enough for He Song.   However.   When he thought of the Mountain Seal.   He Song remembered a conversation he had with Meng Guan after he broke through to Foundation Establishment and joined the Thick Earth Sect.   At that time, Meng Guan had said.   “If you ever come across a Foundation Establishment Master whose dharma title contains the word mountain, it is better to avoid as much as possible. This involves some secret, I won’t explain in detail.”   Recalling Meng Guan’s expression when he said this, He Song gradually developed a tinge of doubt on his face.   Foundation Establishment Masters whose dharma title contains the word mountain.   Master Cheng Shan of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion counts as one.   Master Yuan Shan, whom he had met when he first entered the Thick Earth Sect, also counted as one.   Looking at this way, there should be quite a number of Foundation Establishment Masters whose dharma title contains the word mountain.   Master Cheng Shan’s artifact is called Green Mountain Seal.   And the high-quality spirit artifact bearing the fundament of the Thick Earth Sect is called Mountain Seal.   Such similar names almost made He Song associate them together instantly.   However.   Are there any secrets in this that he did not know?   Due to insufficient information, He Song pondered for a while but could not make any sense of it.   After thinking for a while, He Song stopped pondering about it and began to seriously search for a suitable place to open a spirit field.   This time, He Song left the Thick Earth Sect.   In order to find a suitable place to open a spirit field.   The more spirit fields he opens, the faster he will acquire spirit stones.   With spirit stones, he will have the Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   His chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment will also greatly increase.   So, He Song was extremely dedicated to finding the spirit field.   However.   The places that could be used to open a spirit field were too few.            He Song kept searching, but even after a long search, he still found nothing>.   Either it was too close to a heavily trafficked area by cultivators.   Or the environment was not suitable.   Or it was too close to a mortal city.   Or…   Time flew by.   And it was already two years later.   In these two years, He Song had been continuously searching for places that could be used to open a spirit field.   Surrounding his newly opened spirit field, He Song kept searching.   Finally, due to his relentless effort, after two years, he finally found several places that could be used to open a spirit field.   Previously when he was in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   He Song had also searched for places that could be opened into spirit fields.   But at that time, his cultivation level was too low and his speed was too slow, so after half a year of searching, he did not find a single place that could be used to open a spirit field.   Now.   He Song’s cultivation level had reached the eighth-tier of Qi Refining. After using the Mountain Wind Riding Skill, his speed was incredibly fast.   Under such circumstances, it took him two years to find several places that could be opened into spirit fields.   These spirit fields varied in size, but all in all, they represented He Song’s painstaking efforts.   Counting the new spirit fields and the previously opened thirty-acre spirit field, there was a total of about a hundred acres.   In this way.   In one year, He Song could harvest a hundred thousand pounds of spirit rice, which equated to ten thousand spirit stones, from these hundred acres of spirit fields.   In one year, he could have ten thousand spirit stones.   Now there were still thirteen years left until He Song turned sixty.   If you were to add it all up, He Song should be able to obtain about one hundred and thirty thousand spirit stones in these thirteen years.   However, because some of these spirit fields were still in the process of being converted into actual fields, the actual yields of spirit stones should be somewhat less.   But not too much less; there might only be a few thousand less spirit stones.   Add on the over ten thousand spirit stones he currently had, and the sixty thousand pounds of spirit rice he harvested from the thirty-acre spirit field in the past two years.   As well as his annual salary from the Thick Earth Sect.   In total, if he no longer opens new spirit fields in these thirteen years, he should be able to gain around a hundred and fifty thousand spirit stones.   These one hundred and fifty thousand spirit stones, if used entirely to exchange for Foundation Establishment Elixirs, should be able to be exchanged for ten of them.   Adding to the one he already had.   It would amount to eleven Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   Even if He Song failed the first Foundation Establishment attempt and wasted six Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   By the time he attempted Foundation Establishment the second time, there would still be at least five Foundation Establishment Elixirs available.            Considering this.   He Song let out a sigh of relief, feeling like a weight had been lifted off his heart.   However, all the surrounding areas that could be turned into spirit fields were already developed into spirit fields by him. If he wanted to open more spirit fields next, it would be extremely difficult.   That means, each year, at most he could get ten thousand spirit stones from the spirit fields he has opened.   Want more?   It’s not impossible, but that would purely depend on luck.   Perhaps… could he reactivate the twenty- acre spirit field he abandoned in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion?   Such a thought flashed through He Song’s mind.   But it was immediately dismissed.   That place was no longer safe.   If he went back to reactivate that twenty- acre spirit field and someone came knocking on his door, losing some spirit rice would be the least of his concerns.   He feared that they might publicize everything about that place.   By then, it’s possible that even the hundred-acre spirit field he had newly developed would also be implicated.   For this kind of risky business where the cons outweighed the pros, He Song, after some thoughts, immediately vetoed the idea.   As for the final missing Foundation Establishment Elixir.   After some consideration, He Song didn’t worry about it anymore.   Getting more Foundation Establishment Elixirs was just to leave a safety net for himself.   If he consumed six Foundation Establishment Elixirs, his chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment would be high.   If he is successful in breaking through the Foundation Establishment at once, the safety net he left himself obviously isn’t needed.   If he really fails at Foundation Establishment.   Prior to the second attempt at Foundation Establishment, finding another Foundation Establishment Elixir shouldn’t be a problem.   After all.   In ten or so years time, Meng Guan’s strength would definitely have stabilized in the Foundation Establishment Stage.   As long as He Song opened his mouth to ask, supporting a Foundation Establishment Elixir should be nothing to them.   Two years ago, when Wei Fan failed in making his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Stage, Meng Guan, without hesitation, helped prepare another Foundation Establishment Elixir.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m   Although it was hurried and he had to ask for He Song’s help.   Meng Guan, who would be in ten or so years, in comparison with the current   Meng Guan, in terms of strength and fortune, would simply be incomparable.   However.   Two years have passed now.   Wei Fan’s injuries should have fully healed by now.   It was time he attempted to break through the Foundation Establishment Realm again.   After calculating the time and realising he hadn’t missed it yet, He Song got up and sped towards the Thick Earth Sect.   The Thick Earth Sect.   Outer Disciple living area.   Just as He Song’s figure appeared outside Wei Fan’s courtyard, he saw Meng Guan, who had just opened his courtyard door..        

Chapter 147 - 147: 146: Second Foundation Establishment Translator: 549690339   As Meng Guan was a Foundation Establishment Master, he noticed He Song the moment he arrived.   Therefore, he was able to open the door and invite him in before He Song even had the chance to knock.   Entering the courtyard.   The three of them paid their respects and then sat down.   Under the thick aroma of tea, they began to catch up.   It had been two years since they last met, but their faces remained the same. A sense of familiarity washed over He Song as they exchanged glances.   This familiarity quickly put He Song at ease, and he began to share his experiences over the past two years with the two of them.   However.   He changed the purpose of opening his spirit field to seeking opportunities instead.   In the Cultivation World.   Too many Qi-refining late stage, Qi Refining great perfection, and even Foundation Establishment cultivators grow old over time.   Before they die, they might squander their entire fortune.   Or perhaps leave it all behind for their descendants.   Or randomly find a disciple to bestow upon them everything they have.   As such.   Seeking opportunities amongst those at the Qi Refining and even Foundation Establishment stage is not a secret.   It is common for mortals to benefit from the teachings of cultivators, soaring high and becoming true cultivators themselves.   It is also common for cultivators to inherit resources from their predecessors, and reach the heavens in a single bound.   And occasionally, one might even hear about someone being taken as a disciple by a Foundation Establishment Master, who would then teach them everything they knew.   Of course, He Song wasn’t really seeking opportunities, but rather opening his spirit field.   Naturally, the experiences he recounted didn’t include finding any opportunities.   He had spent two years searching for opportunities outside.   But returned empty-handed.   Upon hearing this, Meng Guan and Wei Fan immediately tried to persuade He Song not to obsess over opportunities any longer.   As for this.   He Song secretly felt pleased but still nodded his head in agreement.   With this incident out in the open, he now had an excuse to refuse anyone who wanted to search for opportunities with him outside the sect in the future.   This was a decision He Song made on the spur of the moment and decided to go along with.   As a cultivator, seeking opportunities outside was normal.    But searching for opportunities with others outside the sect was something He Song would definitely be unwilling to do.   When searching for opportunities together, who knows if someone might stab you in the back.   For the sake of his life.   It was better to fabricate something to use as an excuse to ward off those who wanted to search for opportunities with him outside the sect. In this way, with the precedent of this incident as a reference.   His refusal would be considered reasonable.   Furthermore.   Since Meng Guan and Wei Fan were aware of this matter, anyone who casually inquired would know that his refusal had a reason behind it, and he wouldn’t need to worry about anyone holding a grudge against him for it.   After discussing this matter, the three of them chatted for a while before finally talking about the matters they wanted to address during this meeting. “Do you know where I went after taking on external affairs two years ago?”   Looking into the distance, Meng Guan asked as his eyes suddenly shone with a touch of emotion.   Without waiting for He Song’s response, Meng Guan continued speaking. “Over these past two years, I’ve returned to the Red Spirit Gold Mine.”   “However, my status has changed from being a minor leader to guarding the gold mine as a Foundation Establishment Master.”   “The person who once appointed me as a leader now respectfully addresses me as ‘elder’ when he sees me.”   into the world, I realized that the status of a Foundation Establishment Master is vastly different from a Qi Refining stage cultivator.”   Meng Guan looked at Wei Fan, wanting to say something.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m   But after considering it, he chose not to speak.   However, his gaze seemed to hold a hint of anticipation.   Wei Fan’s opportunity to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage.   Only this once.   If it doesn’t work this time…   Meng Guan shook his head, casting away the negative thoughts in his heart, and then looked at He Song.   “Mr. He, after two years of planning, I still need 1,700 spirit stones to buy another Foundation Establishment Elixir. I wonder if you…”   This matter had been settled two years ago.   Now, two years later, He Song has returned.   Naturally, the spirit stones they originally agreed to lend must be handed over by He Song himself.   He Song was well-prepared for this.   With a swipe on the table in front of him.   1,700 neatly arranged spirit stones appeared on the table.   1,700 spirit stones stacked together shone brilliantly under the sunlight, emitting an enchanting glow.   With so many spirit stones appearing, all three people’s gazes were instantly attracted.   “Alright, time is of the essence. I will head to the sect treasury right away.”   Seeing He Song fulfill the promise of providing the spirit stones, Meng Guan nodded, and after collecting the spirit stones, he thanked him. Immediately, his entire body transformed into a green tunneling light, heading into the distance.    Watching Meng Guan transform into a green tunneling light, shooting into the sky, both He Song and Wei Fan showed a trace of envy in their eyes.   Foundation Establishment.   After breaking through to Foundation Establishment, one can learn tunneling skills.   At that time, they can transform into tunneling light, roaming freely between heaven and earth.   The two who were still at the Qi Refining stage were naturally envious.   This is flying.   Although they could also temporarily ride the wind using the Mountain Wind Riding Skill, it was incomparable to real tunneling skills.   Very soon.   The tunneling light Meng Guan had transformed into flew back from the distance, landing directly in Wei Fan’s courtyard.   As the light dissipated and Meng Guan’s figure appeared, a jade bottle was placed in front of Wei Fan.   Seeing this, a wave of warmth surged in Wei Fan’s heart.   Although he already knew two years ago that his two good friends would help him gather the spirit stones to exchange for his second Foundation Establishment Elixir.   However, when the second Foundation Establishment Elixir actually appeared in front of him, Wei Fan was still moved.   “Thank you both for your assistance. If I succeed in establishing my foundation this time, Wei Fan will never forget your great kindness.”   Picking up the Foundation Establishment Elixir from the table, Wei Fan bowed deeply, solemnly speaking.   Facing Wei Fan’s bow,   This time. both He Song and Menc Guan hurried forward to suDDort him.   However, unlike the previous time, this time Meng Guan was the one to reassure Wei Fan.   “Wei, there’s no need for this. What need is there for such formalities between the three of us? You just go to the quiet room, sit still, and look for the right moment to build your foundation. When the time comes, take the Foundation Establishment Elixir and begin your foundation building.”   With Meng Guan’s comforting words.   Resolution flashed in Wei Fan’s eyes as he stepped into the quiet room.   Looking at his retreating figure, He Song could even feel the determination in Wei Fan’s heart at the moment.   Not until Wei Fan eventually entered the quiet room and closed the door.   Did the courtyard grow quiet again.   Only then did He Song and Meng Guan sit back down at the tea table, each picking up a cup of tea and sighing in relief.   In order not to affect Wei Fan’s state of mind during his foundation establishment breakthrough, the two had been very cautious. Only at this point were they finally able to relax a bit.   “What do you think? Will Wei be able to succeed in his Foundation Establishment breakthrough this time?”   After draining his tea, Meng Guan looked at He Song, wanting to know his opinion.   “I still remember when you entered the quiet room to break through the   Foundation Establishment, Wei asked me the same question.”   Listening to Meng Guan’s inquiry, He Song chuckled, saying something irrelevant.   He seemed to have not heard Meng Guan’s question at all and showed no intention of responding.   But beside him, Meng Guan heard this and his face revealed a trace of emotion.   Then he shook his head and sighed.   “Never mind, I won’t ask. This indeed is not the time to discuss this..”

Chapter 148 - 148: 147: Foundation Establishment Success Translator: 549690339   Seeing this, He Song casually poured him a cup of tea.   Then he slowly began to speak.   “I just wonder if you two would discuss this outside too when I enter the quiet room in the future.”   As he spoke, a touch of oddness flashed across He Song’s face, seemingly recalling the scene at that time.   That scene… it should be quite interesting.   He knew what the two were discussing outside.   They also knew that he knew what they were discussing outside while he was in the quiet room.   But because of the quiet room separating them, they couldn’t hear what each other had discussed.   The scene described by He Song flashed through his mind.   Meng Guan’s face gradually showed a touch of oddness as well.   However.   In response to He Song’s words, he didn’t respond. Instead, he just gave a slight smile and shook his head, gazing into the distance. Seeing this, He Song naturally didn’t speak again.   Suddenly, the small courtyard became quiet.   Only the sound of the two sipping tea occasionally could be heard.   After all, since they were in the Thick Earth Sect and guarding Wei Fan’s small courtyard, all they had to do was wait.   As for danger, He Song felt that even if a Golden Elixir Master were to attack, he wouldn’t need to panic.   Therefore.   With nothing to worry about, He Song soon immersed himself in the comprehension of Array Tao Primary Introduction again.   After studying the array knowledge in Array Tao Primary Introduction for a whole seven years, he felt that he had mastered the various formation methods of the Spirit-Gathering Array, as well as the refining methods of Array Banners and Array Disk.   Next, he just needed to find some materials for refining Array Banners and Array Disk, and he could start refining them.   Once these two items were refined successfully.   He would engrave the array patterns of the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array onto the Array Banners and Array Disk.   By then.   He Song could successfully set up the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array using special methods.   The range and intensity of the spirit Qi in the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array were beyond compare to that of the normal Array.   According to He Song’s guess.   The arrays set up in the Immortal Pavilion should be a Miniature Spirit Gathering Array.   However, the range of the Immortal Pavilion was too large, as the range of the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array was much smaller in comparison.   This left He Song feeling puzzled.    “Could it be that I’m wrong? The Spirit-Gathering Array set up in the Immortal Pavilion is not the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array? But it shouldn’t be, as the spirit Qi concentration and range are indeed identical to the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array.”   “Could it be… that someone has used a special method to overlay several Miniature Spirit Gathering Arrays, manipulating the spirit Qi concentration to converge in the inner circle of the Immortal Pavilion, creating that situation?” “Such a method is not recorded in Array Tao Primary Introduction. It seems that further study is needed.”   After pondering for a moment, He Song quickly shook his head and cast these thoughts aside.   No matter whether the Spirit-Gathering Array set up in the Immortal Pavilion was a Miniature Spirit Gathering Array or not.   His study of the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array could not be interrupted.   Miniature Spirit Gathering Array.   That was the simplest array in Array Tao Primary Introduction.   Other arrays were much more challenging than the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array.   If he wanted to study all the way down, he would have to start with the simple ones and progress to the more advanced ones, so he could learn the array techniques he wanted.   At the same time, once the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array was set up, the spirit Qi concentration He Song could enjoy would be even higher than what he could enjoy within the Thick Earth Sect.   After all, the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array set up in Immortal Pavilion was for the entire Pavilion.   Once He Song successfully set up his Miniature Spirit Gathering Array.   Then, all the spirit Qi gathered by this entire Miniature Spirit Gathering Array would serve only He Song.   Such a terrifying spirit Qi concentration would naturally be higher than the concentration outside the Thick Earth Sect.   By then.   He Song’s cultivation speed would likely increase tremendously.   And the distance to his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment would get closer and closer.   As for studying the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array and the refining methods of Array Banners and Array Disk.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com   Meng Guan saw this and naturally closed his eyes to rest, not knowing what he was doing.   In this way.   Time passed bit by bit.   Until a few days later.   He Song and Meng Guan almost simultaneously opened their eyes.   After exchanging a glance, they both saw a touch of surprise in each other’s eyes.   “Did it work?”   “It worked!”   One asked, one answered. If someone else heard it, they would be confused.   But the two currently in Wei Fan’s small courtyard felt an overwhelming surge of emotion in their hearts.   Just now, a powerful spiritual pressure rose from Wei Fan’s closed-off quiet room and instantly spread around.   He Song and Meng Guan were almost instantly awakened by this powerful spiritual pressure.   That’s when the scene of them opening their eyes simultaneously and then asking and answering just now occurred.    Under what circumstances would such a powerful spiritual pressure appear in the quiet room?   Without a doubt.   It was because Wei Fan had successfully broken through Foundation Establishment.   Only when Wei Fan had successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm would such a powerful spiritual pressure appear.   Although this spiritual pressure made He Song feel a little uncomfortable, compared to the joy brought by his friend’s breakthrough, this discomfort was quickly thrown to the back of his mind.   “Good, good, Foundation Establishment is good, it’s great he reached Foundation Establishment.”   In front of He Song, Meng Guan’s face showed delight as he repeatedly exclaimed ‘good’.   At the same time, Meng Guan quickly stood up and headed towards the location of the quiet room.   Halfway there.   He stopped.   He paced in front of the quiet room again.   He Song didn’t understand why.   But looking at the joy on his face, no one would know whether it was him who had successfully reached Foundation Establishment.   However, Meng Guan had already reached Foundation Establishment, so it was impossible for him to reach it again.   It’s just that Meng Guan’s actions were a bit puzzling to He Song.   As he paced.   Meng Guan seemed to notice the confusion on He Song’s face, and the joy on his face grew even deeper.   He stopped pacing and returned to sit down in front of He Song.   Then, he spoke playfully.   “Fellow Daoist, do you know why I am so happy that Wei has reached   Foundation Establishment?”   Without waiting for He Song to answer,   Meng Guan spoke again, explaining the reason for his excitement.   “Wei has reached Foundation Establishment, and as a close friend, I am sincerely happy for him.”   “But besides that, there is another thing that brings me joy along with this.” “When one reaches Foundation Establishment, they must go to meet the Sect   Leader.”   “When I met the Sect Leader seven years ago, he bestowed two Foundation Establishment Elixirs upon me.”   “Now that Wei has reached Foundation Establishment, it’s hard to guarantee that the Sect Leader won’t bestow something again. ”   ‘What if…”   Looking at He Song, a hopeful gleam appeared in Meng Guan’s eyes.   If the Sect Leader were to bestow Foundation Establishment Elixirs again,   He Song’s chances of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm would greatly increase.   Now, he himself and Wei Fan had both successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.   If He Song were to successfully break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in the future, their small circle of three would become a formidable force..

Chapter 149 - 149: 148: Sect Trembles Translator: 549690339   The three great Foundation Establishment cultivators joined forces, and their deterrence power was self-evident.   At the same time.   If the three of them indeed reached Foundation Establishment, perhaps the Sect Leader might be so delighted that he might grant more rewards.   He had already seen the Sect Leader seven years ago.   And he had kept some secrets from He Song and the others.   But now, Wei Fan had successfully broken through to Foundation Establishment, so these secrets should be shared with Wei Fan and He Song.   The current Thick Earth Sect.   Was not as peaceful as it seemed on the surface.   Undercurrents were surging in the hidden depths.   He had previously advised the two of them to stay away from Masters with the character “Shan” in their dharma titles.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com   That was because their strength was insufficient.   Now that their small circle had added another Foundation Establishment Master, it was time to reveal these secrets.   He glanced towards the quiet room.   Meng Guan remained silent.   Otherwise, they would have to go through it all again with Wei Fan after he had already told He Song.   Too troublesome.   It was better to discuss it with Wei Fan after he came out of secluded cultivation.   On the side, after hearing Meng Guan’s words, He Song thought for a moment and nodded thoughtfully.   He didn’t pay much attention to the matter either.   Foundation Establishment Elixir.   He really didn’t lack it.   But if he was really granted another Foundation Establishment Elixir at that time, He Song could only accept the kindness and wait for a chance to repay it in the future.   As they were within the Thick Earth Sect.   The concentration of spirit Qi was naturally quite high.   In this area where the outer disciples of the Thick Earth Sect lived, the concentration of spirit Qi was even higher than in the western part of Green Wall Immortal City.   But it wasn’t much higher.   When Foundation Establishment cultivators broke through, there would still be a vortex of spirit Qi that appeared.   It wasn’t big, but it was enough to alarm the disciples and elders of the Thick Earth Sect.            During Meng Guan and He Song’s conversation, a small vortex of spirit Qi had already appeared above Wei Fan’s courtyard.   The spirit Qi vortex continuously attracted the surrounding spirit Qi into it, pouring it directly into the quiet room where Wei Fan was cultivating in seclusion. Wei Fan absorbed it, quickly solidifying his cultivation.   Outside.   Meng Guan wore a perplexed expression.   He Song, however, had already made his way to the top of Wei Fan’s courtyard as if he was an expert.   From there, He Song’s gaze swept around and immediately noticed several figures coming out of their rooms and looking in his direction from afar.   Wei Fan had already successfully broken through to Foundation Establishment and was currently consolidating his cultivation by crazily absorbing spirit Qi.   This was also the source of the vortex of spirit Qi above Wei Fan’s courtyard.   Such commotion would naturally attract the attention of other outer disciples and even other Foundation Establishment elders.   In the short time it took He Song to reach the top of the courtyard, he had seen at least several dozen people looking in his direction.   Fortunately.   This place was the Thick Earth Sect.   Most of the people watching from a distance were outer disciples of the Thick Earth Sect, with a few Foundation Establishment elders mixed in.   They didn’t need to be as vigilant as when Meng Guan first broke through.   Moreover, after seeing He Song’s actions, Meng Guan, who was confused on the ground, quickly came to He Song’s side and faced the gazes coming from all directions together with him.   One Qi Refining late stage cultivator.   One Foundation Establishment Master.   And one Foundation Establishment Master who was consolidating his cultivation.   Such a lineup made the onlookers’ expressions varied.   However.   After observing for a moment, those people dispersed their gazes one after another.   But as they moved their gazes away, waves of conversation began to ripple through the area where the Thick Earth Sect’s outer disciples lived.   “Foundation Establishment… I never thought that just months after entering the sect, I would witness the rise of a Foundation Establishment Master,” a young man jumped down from the roof, his face full of longing.   “In half a year, I too will step into Foundation Establishment!” A determined-looking young man proclaimed confidently.   “If I’m not mistaken, this person seems to be the loose cultivator who joined the Thick Earth Sect seven years ago, forming a connection to the recently achieved Foundation Establishment…” Far away, Master Yuan Shan retracted his gaze, deep in thought.   “This person seems to be the first cultivator to successfully break through to the Foundation Establishment realm in the past five years. I wonder whether it’s luck or strength,” another young man sighed as he withdrew his gaze.   He Song and Meng Guan seemed to sense the various conversations but couldn’t hear them clearly because of the distance.   It was only after everyone had retracted their gazes that the two left the rooftop and continued waiting by the table.   This time, Wei Fan’s breakthrough to Foundation Establishment.   It would probably take some time to consolidate his cultivation.            Once his cultivation was completely consolidated, it would be time for him to come out of seclusion.   Soon.   As the spirit Qi was dense here.   Wei Fan’s cultivation consolidation speed was also relatively fast.   He didn’t make He Song and Meng Guan wait for too long.   At some point.   With a creak, the door of the quiet room slowly opened, and a figure shot out of the room like lightning.   After only a few steps, Wei Fan’s figure appeared beside the table.   He sat down.   “Congratulations to Brother Wei for successfully establishing Foundation and setting foot on the Immortal Path from now on!”   “Congratulations to Brother Wei for successfully establishing Foundation and setting foot on the Immortal Path from now on!”   As soon as Wei Fan emerged from seclusion, He Song and Meng Guan congratulated him without delay.   Foundation Establishment.   Once this step was taken, there would be a clear distinction between immortals and mortals.   From then on, be it lifespan, strength, or status, a huge gap would emerge between the cultivators of the Qi Refining stage and them.   This gap was like a chasm.   And it was only because the three of them had formed this small circle from humble beginnings that their interaction was so harmonious.   “Many thanks to both of you for guarding the area during my breakthrough. Now that I’ve successfully achieved Foundation Establishment, I won’t forget the promise I made!”   Without any arrogance due to his entry into Foundation Establishment, Wei Fan hurriedly returned the greeting and mentioned his previous promise once more.   However, both He Song and Meng Guan merely waved their hands, not taking it too seriously.   After all, their small circle had been established for so many years.   There was no need to say much about how well they understood each other. As for Wei Fan.   Both He Song and Meng Guan knew that he would never be the kind of person who thought too highly of himself once he gained power.   In the past, when He Song and Meng Guan needed help, Wei Fan would do his best to help them without any hesitation.   Now that he had achieved Foundation Establishment. It was impossible for him to do anything ungrateful.   “Brother Wei, there’s no need for that.”   “However, since Brother Wei has successfully established his Foundation, there are some things that I need to discuss with both of you.”   With Wei Fan coming out of seclusion, Meng Guan, who had been prepared for quite some time, immediately started speaking. He wanted to share the secrets he knew with both of them.   Seven years ago.   He had followed Master Qingy Yue to meet the Sect Leader.   But on his way back home, Master Qingy Yue had told him about the hidden secrets within the current Thick Earth Sect.   It was then that Meng Guan fully understood why he had been warned to stay away from Masters with the character “Shan” in their dharma titles when he first arrived at the sect.   At the same time, this secret was the reason why he had advised He Song and Wei Fan to stay away from such Masters..        

Chapter 150: Chapter 149: The Secret of the Thick Earth   Translator: 549690339   Do you know why, seven years ago, I warned you to avoid Foundation Establishment Masters with the character mountain in their dharma titles if you ever come across them?   When He Song and Wei Fan sat down with solemn expressions, they were ready to listen carefully to what Meng Guan had to say about it.   At the moment Meng Guans voice sounded, it made the two exchange glances.   This matter.   He Song had also thought about it before.   But at that time, the information was too limited, and there was no way to guess.   Therefore, after half a day of pondering, he had to put it aside and think about it later.   But now.   Listening to Meng Guans words, was there really a secret hidden in this matter?   With a puzzled look in his eyes, He Song looked at Meng Guan.   Next to him, Wei Fan, who had just broken through the Foundation Establishment and consolidated his cultivation, also looked at Meng Guan at this moment.   Seeing that both of them were looking at him, Meng Guan realized that neither of them knew the reason for this matter yet.   This matter has its roots in the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect.   The main peak of the Thick Earth Sect is the high mountain in the center of the sect, but in fact, it is not a mountain, but a spirit artifact, a high-quality spirit artifact the Mountain Seal!   It is a high-quality spirit artifact refined by a Nascent Soul Realm Ancestor! When controlled by a Yuanying Ancestor, it can kill a Nascent Soul, and when controlled by a Golden Elixir Master, it has the power to kill a Golden Elixir.   This is one of the foundations that have allowed the Thick Earth Sect to stand for tens of thousands of years, and it is also the location of the sects treasury.   As Meng Guan spoke, he looked at the two of them, but he didnt see any surprise in their eyes.   They had already heard about this matter from Pinger seven years ago.   Now that Meng Guan mentioned it again, it made the two of them somewhat disinterested.   Seeing this, Meng Guan knew that he had said something unnecessary and quickly continued.   More than seven thousand years ago, the Nascent Soul Realm Ancestor of the Thick Earth Sect who refined the Mountain Seal passed away, and the high-quality spirit artifact, the Mountain Seal, became a symbol of the Thick Earth Sect Leader.   Many generations have passed since that Ancestor with the Nascent Soul Realm appeared. After his passing, the position of the Sect Leader has always been under the control of his descendants.   The Ancestors dharma title was Lianshan, and most of his descendants took the character mountain in their dharma titles.   For example, Master Yuan Shan, Master Cheng Shan   Thus, the Mountain Seal has been passed down from generation to generation, and now it is controlled by the current Sect Leader, Master Fa   Xuan.bender   At this point, Meng Guan stopped talking and looked at the two people in front of him.            A trace of doubt flashed across He Songs face.   Ancestor Lianshan.   Master Yuan Shan.   Master Cheng Shan.   The character mountain was included in their dharma titles.   At first glance, these dharma titles seemed to belong to the same family.   But the dharma title of Master Fa Xuan didnt seem to resemble those of the mountain family, did it?   Wasnt it said that the position of Sect Leader of the Thick Earth Sect would always be held by the descendants of Ancestor Lianshan? How did it suddenly change when it came to Fa Xuan?   He Song was puzzled.   At the side.   Wei Fans face was also filled with doubt.   Youre not mistaken. Master Fa Xuan is indeed not a descendant of that Nascent Soul Realm Ancestor.    With the resources of the Thick Earth Sect, they can only cultivate at most one Golden Elixir Master in each generation to inherit the tradition and suppress the sect.   More than a hundred years ago, when the previous Sect Leader passed away, the Thick Earth Sect used all its resources to cultivate a Golden Elixir Master, Master Yan Shan.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m   In theory, Master Yan Shan should be the Sect Leader of the Thick Earth Sect in the future.   But its hard to predict the will of heaven. During Master Yan Shans seclusive cultivation for a breakthrough, Master Fa Xuan, with great perseverance, wisdom, and fortune, managed to advance from a Foundation Establishment Master to a Golden Elixir Master without the support of the sect.   By the time Master Yan Shan broke through, Master Fa Xuan had already taken control of the sect and seized the position of Sect Leader.   Since then. there have been two Golden Elixir Masters in the Thick Earth Sect   suppressing the sect, and their prestige is unparalleled.   As Meng Guan spoke, his face turned a little flushed, and even his voice grew a little louder.   It seemed as if the scene of the two Masters fighting was right in front of him, and he witnessed it with his own eyes.   He Song remained calm, but he was moved in his heart.   Master Yan Shan.   Master Fa Xuan.   Two Golden Elixir Masters in one sect.   The Thick Earth Sect seemed to be much stronger than he had guessed.   However, would Master Yan Shan really give up his position as Sect Leader and hand it over to Master Fa Xuan?   He Song didnt quite believe it.   Both of them were Golden Elixir Masters. In theory, the position of Sect Leader should have been reserved for Master Yan Shan.            Master Fa Xuan merely took advantage of Master Yan Shans breakthrough and used his Golden Elixir strength to suppress the sect, seizing the position of Sect Leader in the process.   If they were to get serious, there must be a deadly battle between the two.   But from what he saw now, Master Fa Xuans position as Sect Leader seemed quite stable, and the Thick Earth Sect had not experienced any violent disputes.   At most, they were just reminded to avoid the Masters with the character mountain in their dharma titles as much as possible.   What was going on?   With doubts, He Song looked at Meng Guan.   He knew that since Meng Guan had said so much, he would definitely continue to speak.   After calming down a bit.   Meng Guan looked at his two friends who were patiently waiting for him to continue speaking. Feeling a little embarrassed, Meng Guan hurriedly continued.   For thousands of years, descendants of that Nascent Soul Realm Ancestor have always taken the position of Sect Leader in Thick Earth Sect. Now that something unexpected has happened, it has naturally aroused dissatisfaction among them.   In the past, they simply had no Golden Elixir Masters who could contend with Master Fa Xuan, so they had no choice but to accept the situation.   But when Master Yan Shan broke through and came out of seclusion, a fierce battle ensued.   Master Qingyue did not disclose the details to me but made it clear that the sect has now been divided into two factions.   One faction is led by Master Yan Shan and consists mostly of the descendants of that Nascent Soul Realm Ancestor.   The other faction is led by Master Fa Xuan and mostly includes the newly promoted Foundation Establishment cultivators of the past hundred years.   Ahem, in the beginning, both of you were categorized into Master Fa Xuans faction. Because of this, I specifically warned you both to avoid encountering   Masters with mountain characters in their dharma titles as much as possible.   Although they wont make things difficult for you, they will generally not show you a friendly face.   In the end, an embarrassed expression flashed across Meng Guans face.   At first.   He had followed Master Qingyue to the Thick Earth Sect in a daze and met with Master Fa Xuan.   Unbeknownst to him.   This meeting had put him, as well as He Song and Wei Fan, in Master Fa Xuans faction.   Master Fa Xuan giving them the two Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   It was probably done to win them over.   He accepted them.   Of course, that also meant agreeing to it.   Now that Wei Fan had also broken through the Foundation Establishment, he had to tell them everything in its entirety and not conceal anything anymore.   Of course, hiding this matter was not because he had any ulterior motives.   It was simply because their cultivation levels had been too low before, so there was no need to mention it.   Now, Wei Fan had broken through the Foundation Establishment and was about to meet Master Fa Xuan. It was better to speak up so that He Song wouldnt think he had any ulterior motives..

Chapter 151: Chapter 150: Conflict Between Two Factions   Translator: 549690339   Moreover, when Wei Fan first attempted the Foundation Establishment, the Foundation Establishment Elixir he used indeed came from the hands of Master Fa Xuan.   Even if it was with the purpose of courting Meng Guan.   But since the offer came in generosity, he needed to remember this kindness as well.   Now, Wei Fan has successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.   He must go to see Master Fa Xuan.   It is necessary to understand these matters before meeting him.   As a Foundation Establishment Master who already bears the mark of Master Fa Xuans faction, if he was to perform actions favoring Master Yan Shans faction It probably wouldnt end well.   At his side,   After hearing Meng Guans description, a flash of realization passed through He Songs eyes.   No wonder Master Qingy Yue rushed to sway Meng Guan immediately after his Foundation Establishment.   No wonder Master Qingy Yue was intercepted by Master Yuan Shan when he was leading Meng Guan back to the sect.   No wonder Master Qingy Yue, without any respectful face, left directly with the spirit boat when intercepted by Master Yuan Shan.   No wonder Master Fa Xuan generously gave two Foundation Establishment Elixirs to win over Meng Guan, as a Foundation Establishment Master.   No wonder   They are short of manpower.   The conflict between Master Fa Xuan and Master Yan Shan has already entered a stable period.   Without any significant clashes seen, the Thick Earth Sect seemed peaceful on the surface.   But the more power gathered around him, the greater the chances of success.   A Foundation Establishment Master,   They are worth courting.   As a Golden Elixir Master, recruiting some Foundation Establishment Masters as followers is pretty standard.   But   How come he suddenly got involved in the sects internal struggle without any indication?   Moreover, it seemed that his side appeared more like the villains.   Suppressed the whole sect with his Golden Elixir strength while Master Yan Shan was going through the Golden Elixir breakthrough, forcibly seizing the position of Sect Leader and took control of the entire Thick Earth Sect.   Such actions are usually common with villains, arent they?   He Song could even predict the future development of the situation.   When the time comes and Master Yan Shans strength is sufficient, Master Yan Shan, who has more support, will naturally try various means to regain the Sect Leaders position.   Suppose Master Fa Xuan fails to hold on.   Wont someone like him who has been tagged as a follower of Master Fa Xuan be immediately made a scapegoat?   With this thought flashing through his mind, He Song felt a chill running down his back, and a cold sweat broke out instantly.    It seems that he couldnt afford to stay in the Thick Earth Sect.   Should he run now?   Or should he wait a while longer to run? Before running,   Should he bring his two friends along?   However, would having two Foundation Establishment Masters fleeing along make them a big target?   In the blink of an eye, countless escape plans had emerged in He Songs mind.   However,   After thinking it over carefully, He Songs emotions gradually calmed down.   He could stay in the Thick Earth Sect for the time being.   He was just a little Qi Refining cultivator now.   Although he had two friends in the Foundation Establishment Realm, in the Cultivation World, personal strength still came first.   As a small Qi Refining cultivator, as long as he minds his own business and avoids those Foundation Establishment Masters with mountain in their dharma title, he shouldnt face any danger.   Even if he provokes them, given the current peaceful atmosphere within the Thick Earth Sect, there shouldnt be any big trouble.   Suppose things turned out exactly as he anticipated, and the struggle between Master Yan Shan and Master Fa Xuan became endless, finally leading to Master Fa Xuans defeat and escape.   That would still take a considerable amount of time.   For a Golden Elixir Master,   A few years, a few decades, or even a hundred years, are simply a brief period.   And for him?   He only needs a dozen more years to achieve his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm.   By the time he completes Foundation Establishment and absorbs all the knowledge within the Thick Earth Sect, it shouldnt take too long.   If it goes like this,   By the time the conflict between the two sides heats up,   He Song would have achieved his Foundation Establishment and mastered all kinds of necessary knowledge.   At that time,   He Song could leave whenever he wanted.   However, he should be more cautious in his future days at the Thick Earth Sect.   He should strive to remain low-profile.   Only in this way would he not draw too much attention.   By the time he needs to flee, he can escape before anyone notices.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   His mind raced through all these thoughts.   He Song felt as though a weight was lifted off his chest.   At the same time, he couldnt help but feel grateful that he didnt join the Thick Earth Sect as a Formation Genius back then.   If he had indeed acted rashly and used his status as a Formation Genius to join the Thick Earth Sect, every move he made would probably have attracted attention from both factions.    An Array Path Master cant keep a low profile like an ordinary disciple.   With an Array Path Master joining, either faction would experience significant improvement. Had he really done that,   Forget about escape.   He would surely have been under intense scrutiny from both sides.   Having felt relief, He Song gained assurance, and he also had a plan regarding the internal struggles within the Thick Earth Sect.   Next to He Song,   After hearing Meng Guans words, Wei Fan also showed a look of understanding at this moment.   Wei Fan was not like He Song, who thought through a great deal in a mere instant.   Wei Fan simply understood a few things.   Also, knowing that there were internal struggles within the Thick Earth Sect, he realized he had been involuntarily drawn into it.   I understand now, we three are already on the same side as Master Fa Xuan.   Which means, this time upon my breakthrough to Foundation Establishment, if I go to meet Master Fa Xuan with Lao Meng   As he spoke, a light shone in Wei Fans eyes. Looking at Meng Guan, an unusual expression emerged.   Then, he turned to He Song.   He wanted to go with Meng Guan.   If Master Fa Xuan bestows two more Foundation Establishment Elixirs, or even one, He Songs chance of Foundation Establishment would significantly increase.   He Song, like Wei Fan, has a Four Spirits Root.   Even with steady cultivation, he would get one chance for Foundation Establishment.bender   With the Foundation Establishment Elixir and a bit of diligence, hell have two opportunities for Foundation Establishment just like Wei Fan.   Two chances of Foundation Establishment, with a Foundation Establishment   Elixir available each time,   The chance of He Songs successful Foundation Establishment would naturally increase significantly.   If He Song also breaks through into the Foundation Establishment Realm,   Then wouldnt their small circle have three Foundation Establishment Masters?   Three Foundation Establishment Masters,   That would be an imposing force.   Whether for Master Fa Xuans faction or for themselves, it would be a boon.   At his side,   Seeing Wei Fan looking at He Song as well, a slight smile emerged on Meng Guans face.   Alright, lets not get too hopeful, its not our call, it depends on the Sect   Leaders mood.   However, now that the matter is settled, lets get going and meet the Sect   Leader.   Signaling Wei Fan to calm down, Meng Guan rose to his feet, looking toward the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect.   There, Master Fa Xuan must have been waiting for a while..

Chapter 152 - 152: 151: Foundation Establishment Elixir Translator: 549690339   As a Golden Elixir Master, he naturally could not conceal the emergence of a newly promoted Foundation Establishment disciple in the sect.   Before, some time had been wasted in order to enlighten Wei Fan on the internal factional struggles within the Thick Earth Sect.   Now that everything was clear, it was time to meet the Sect Leader.   Seeing Meng Guan urging him, Wei Fan also stood up.   After greeting He Song and telling him to wait for them to return, the two of them headed towards the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect.   As for He Song,   He shook his head and continued to drink tea after watching them leave.   He understood the thoughts of his two friends.   Last time, when Meng Guan had a breakthrough in the Foundation Establishment, the Sect Leader generously granted two Foundation Establishment Elixirs for the sake of their friendship.   Now, Wei Fan successfully built his Foundation Establishment with the help of that Elixir, as well as the one bought through the joint efforts of the three of them.   With Wei Fan’s successful Foundation Establishment, when the two go to see the Sect Leader again, it’s very likely that another Foundation Establishment Elixir might be bestowed.   Among the trio, two of them have already achieved Foundation Establishment.   Even if it was just to win over these two Foundation Establishment disciples, some benefits would have to be offered for the third person among them.   At the same time, the rewards for Wei Fan and Meng Guan would naturally not be lacking.   As for meeting the Sect Leader, a Qi Refining stage outer disciple like him would definitely not be qualified.   Even seven years ago, when they had just joined the sect, Master Qing Yue had accompanied Meng Guan to meet the Sect Leader, while he and Wei Fan followed Ping’er and the others to seek out an outer Elder and become outer disciples.   Now,   With Wei Fan breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage, it was natural for Meng Guan to bring him to meet the Sect Leader.   As for He Song,   He wouldn’t have a chance to meet the Sect Leader until he makes a breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment realm.   However, He Song didn’t care much.   He, who had traveled through time from the Information Big Bang Era, didn’t have much admiration for these so-called important figures in the eyes of others.   Cultivators are people too, just somewhat more powerful before they become immortal.    Whether it’s Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Golden Elixir, or   Yuanying, in He Song’s eyes, they’re all just more powerful individuals.   When he met them, He Song would naturally follow the norms of the Cultivation World, showing the proper etiquette as a junior, without revealing any flaws.   But if they expected him to sincerely admire these powerful figures like others in the Cultivation World, it’s simply impossible.   As an everlasting being, in He Song’s opinion, these people were all targets he could surpass one day.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   How could he admire someone who was destined to be surpassed?   Of course, He Song still needed to maintain a superficial politeness.   And he would never let others see his inner thoughts.   In the Cultivation World, killing people over a disagreement was not unheard of.   He Song did not want to die over such trivial matters.   An hour later,   Meng Guan and Wei Fan reappeared outside the small courtyard.   He Song casually opened the door and after welcoming the two into the courtyard, a small jade bottle appeared before him.   “My friend, do not refuse. The Sect Leader has rewarded us both quite generously this time. This Foundation Establishment Elixir was explicitly given to you by him.”   Handing the small jade bottle to He Song, Wei Fan’s face was filled with happiness.   It seemed that he had gained quite a bit when meeting the Sect Leader.   On the side,   Meng Guan was also beaming.   With his best friend breaking through to Foundation Establishment, he must have gained some rewards as well when they met with the Sect Leader together.   You should know that Wei Fan was not only his friend but also introduced by him to the Thick Earth Sect.   Now that he had broken through to the Foundation Establishment, the rewards from the Sect Leader would naturally not be small for Meng Guan.   Seeing both of their faces glowing with happiness, it seemed as if they had both gained big benefits. After thinking for a moment, He Song naturally followed suit and thanked his friends before stowing the small jade bottle in his storage bag.   At the same time, he couldn’t help but sigh at Master Fa Xuan’s generosity.   Rewards that were enough to satisfy both Wei Fan and Meng Guan, along with the two Foundation Establishment Elixirs he had received;   It was evident that Master Fa Xuan was truly willing to invest in his faction.   It’s likely that Master Qing Yue had also gained quite a bit seven years ago.    Of course,   It might also be because Master Fa Xuan wanted to win people’s hearts or attract more Foundation Establishment disciples to join his faction with such generous rewards.   Such rewards probably also included the intention to expand his power. However, even if that were the case, the benefits he received were tangible and real.   Only by being generous to his subordinates can one attract more people.   This point, Master Fa Xuan should be very clear about.   He Song naturally would not refuse such benefits that came his way.   Wei Fan and Meng Guan felt the same way.   With this newly obtained Foundation Establishment Elixir, He Song now had two Elixirs in his possession.   Taking into account the future earnings from the hundred-acre spirit field and the sect’s annual salary, even if He Song failed in his first Foundation   Establishment attempt and wasted six elixirs,   he would have enough spirit stones to exchange for another six Foundation Establishment Elixirs in the sect treasury.   In this way,   When this Foundation Establishment Elixir was placed into his storage bag, a weight lifted from He Song’s heart.   Next, as long as he looked after the hundred-acre spirit field every year, his resources for Foundation Establishment would no longer be lacking. At least, he would definitely not lack Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   This time, the harvest was quite good.   With this thought in mind, the three of them sat down in the courtyard again.   This time, the atmosphere in the small courtyard quickly warmed up.   Since they all had gained quite a few benefits, they were very happy in their exchanges.   In the end,   Meng Guan gave some advice to Wei Fan regarding what to pay attention to after entering Foundation Establishment and recommended some Foundation Establishment techniques for him to learn before bidding farewell and leaving.   Seeing this, He Song naturally took his leave as well. Leaving Wei Fan’s small courtyard, he quickly returned to his own little courtyard.   However, when he turned to look back at Wei Fan’s courtyard, a thought crossed He Song’s mind.   “This must be the last time we gather at that small courtyard. Once Wei breaks through to Foundation Establishment, he will be able to open up a cave mansion in the Thick Earth Sect.”   “It’s just a question of where he will choose to open up his cave mansion.”   “Will he become neighbors with Lao Meng, or find a secluded place to focus on cultivation?”   With that idea in his mind, He Song’s gaze swept across his small courtyard, and a desire to open up a cave mansion arose in his heart as well. Opening a cave mansion in the outside world was not a whim of his; but the result of some deep contemplation.   At the moment,   He Song only needed to buy some materials, refine the Array Banners and Array Disk, engrave the array patterns of the small Spirit-Gathering Array on the banners and disk, and he would be able to set up the small Spirit-Gathering   Array..

Chapter 153 - 153: 152: Cries to Heaven Go Unanswered Translator: 549690339   Once He Song could set up a small Spirit-Gathering Array, it meant that the concentration of spirit Qi he could enjoy would be greatly increased.   Being in a small Spirit-Gathering Array, the concentration of spirit Qi would definitely be higher than in the small courtyard he currently lived in.   As a result, He Song’s cultivation speed would also be greatly improved.   Opening a cave mansion outside and setting up a small Spirit-Gathering Array to accelerate his own Cultivation was something He Song had planned long ago.   Now that he thought about it again, it was because he was more eager to advance to the Foundation Establishment stage and gain the ability to protect himself.   This Thick Earth Sect… wasn’t as peaceful as he had thought before.   He pondered for a long time in the small courtyard.   He Song took a step forward and walked straight towards the outside of the Thick Earth Sect.   First, he needed to buy some materials to refine the Array Banners and Array Disk required for the small Spirit-Gathering Array.   Once he had set up a small Spirit-Gathering Array,   Then he would learn a Concealment Array that could deceive divine sense scanning.   By then, it would not be too late to open a cave mansion in the wilderness.   After leaving the Thick Earth Sect, He Song quickly arrived at the nearest Immortal City to the Thick Earth Sect.   This Immortal City, called Mountain Immortal City, was located to the north of the mountain gate of the Thick Earth Sect, only about ten thousand miles away.   It was under the control of the Thick Earth Sect.   Also known as Mountain.   He Song didn’t even have to think about it to know that this place was controlled by Master Yan Shan’s faction.   However, He Song didn’t care.   After leaving the Thick Earth Sect, He Song had put on a black robe and performed the Breath Concealment Formula, hiding his aura completely.   When entering Mountain Immortal City, he had even changed his appearance completely.   This time, even if Wei Fan and Meng Guan were to come and observe him face-to-face, they probably wouldn’t be able to recognize He Song’s true appearance.   As such, He Song naturally didn’t need to worry about his identity being exposed or being troubled by Master Yan Shan’s faction.   His purpose for coming here was merely to purchase some materials to refine Array Banners and Array Disks.   Upon entering Mountain Immortal City,   He Song quickly found a place to buy various materials.   Following his memory, he asked for materials needed for refining Array Banners and Array Disks.   After a brief contemplation, He Song directly asked to purchase five sets of materials for refining Array Disks and Array Banners.   One set of materials could refine one Array Disk and ten Array Banners.   For example, to set up a small Spirit-Gathering Array, one Array Disk and five Array Banners were needed, along with array patterns engraved within them.   He Song intended to buy five sets all at once because he didn’t want to make another trip each time he needed to set up an array.   It would be too troublesome.   However,   As soon as He Song stated his request, the shopkeeper in front of him, after hearing his request, carefully spoke.   “Mrs. Lin, would you like to invite an Array Path Master to help you set up the array?   This shopkeeper’s name was Sun Yong, a sixth-tier Qi Refining cultivator.    He Song didn’t use his real name or the name Han Feiyu when he came to Mountain Immortal City.   Since he couldn’t use his real name,   He didn’t know if the name Fei Yu was detected by the Thick Earth Sect.   For safety reasons, He Song casually said his name was Lin Fan.   Therefore, when Sun Yong addressed He Song, he called him Mrs. Lin.   “You don’t have to worry about that; I just need these materials. Are you selling them or not?”   He Song didn’t give Sun Yong a good look when he suddenly asked his   question.   It was a mutually beneficial deal between buyer and seller.   As a shopkeeper, asking about the customer’s purpose for buying these items was a big taboo.   If He Song continued to be polite, others might think he could be easily bullied.   Moreover, the Mountain Immortal City was so large that He Song wasn’t worried about not finding another shop selling these materials.   “I’m selling, of course, Mrs. Lin. The reason I brought up this matter is to let Mrs. Lin know that our store has already refined blank array formation disks and array banners.”   As he spoke, Sun Yong stealthily looked at He Song and saw that his expression remained unchanged before continuing to speak.   “If Mrs. Lin would like to invite an Array Path Master to set up an array, you could simply buy some blank array formation disks and Array Banners to take back. That way, you won’t have to go through the trouble of refining them, and the Array Path Master you invite would be more satisfied.”   However,   After Sun Yong finished speaking, he saw that the light in front of him suddenly became brighter.   When he looked up,   He found that He Song’s figure had long gone.   Looking at He Song’s retreating figure, Sun Yong had a trace of confusion on his face.   This person…   Wasn’t he just listening intently?   How did he run away while listening?   Regardless of Sun Yong’s confusion behind him, He Song, who had already left, had made up his mind.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   In the future, even if that shop went bankrupt, he would never set foot inside it again.   As a true Array Path Master.   For He Song, the various taboos of Array Skills were naturally well-understood.   He naturally knew about the blank array formation disk and Array Banners mentioned by Sun Yong.   Although it seemed much more convenient than refining it himself.   But.   Outside, who would dare use Array Disks and Banners refined by others?   He Song remembered that the Array Tao Primary Introduction clearly warned about this.   When refining Array Disks and Banners, cultivators can perform tricks inside them.   If they only added some Tracking Skills, it would still be fine.   At most, someone would only find him and locate the place where he set up the array.   But if strange skills were added…   It could lead to a disaster.    Although Sun Yong was able to open a shop in Mountain Immortal City, he wouldn’t resort to such behavior.   But it’s not about fearing ten thousand times.   It’s about fearing the one-in-a-million chance.   He Song didn’t want to buy these items and then suddenly be found by a group of burly men one day or suffer other changes.   By then, it would be too late for him to cry for help.   Therefore, He Song did not dare to use Array Disks and Banners refined by others.   Even if it was troublesome, He Song would choose to refine his own Array Disks and Banners.   Only in this way, he could be safer.   Out of caution.   He Song simply left the shop directly.   Ignoring Sun Yong’s attempt to retain him behind.   A moment later.   He Song changed into a black robe and modified his appearance and figure.   He appeared in another shop selling various materials.   This time, there were no issues.   He stated his requirements, and the shopkeeper packed all the materials he needed and handed them over.   Due to his previous experience in the first shop, He Song doubled his required materials.   He ordered ten sets of materials for refining Array Disks and Banners.   Paid with one hand.   Received the goods with the other hand.   After the money and goods were settled, He Song left.   Searching for a place that sold spirit amulets in the Mountain Immortal City, He Song thought for a while and purchased another 20 high-quality Thick Earth Amulets.   These twenty high-quality Thick Earth Amulets, plus the ones He Song had bought before, could help raise his safety level higher.   After purchasing everything, He Song casually went to an inn in the Mountain Immortal City, changed his appearance, and walked out of the inn.   After making sure that there was no one following him, He Song immediately left the city and hid underground, returning to the Thick Earth Sect.   Because He Song was too cautious.   He didn’t show off any wealth.   He even went to the inn to change his appearance and disguise before leaving the city.   Thus, on his way back to the Thick Earth Sect, there were no issues.   Upon returning to the Thick Earth Sect, He Song began refining Array Disks and Banners.   Preparing to set up the small Spirit-Gathering Array.   And so,   Time flew by quickly.   In the blink of an eye,   Two years had quietly passed.   Two years ago,   He Song returned from the Mountain Immortal City with ten sets of materials for refining Array Disks and Banners.   After returning to the sect, he quickly refined an Array Disk and five Array Banners.   With this,   The materials needed for the small Spirit-Gathering Array were completely ready..

Chapter 154: Chapter 153: Two Years Later   Translator: 549690339   However, He Song encountered significant resistance when drawing array patterns on the Array Disk and Array Banners.   Drawing array patterns on spirit stones.   And drawing array patterns on Array Disk and Array Banners.   Are entirely different concepts.   Even though He Song was skilled at engraving array patterns on spirit stones, doing so on Array Disks and Array Banners was still very challenging.   As a result, when He Song finally managed to create the Array Disks and Array Banners and began engraving array patterns on them, it took him several months to complete the whole process of engraving the array patterns for the Small Spirit-Gathering Array.   After successfully engraving the array patterns,   He Song couldn’t reveal his array tao talent while in the Thick Earth Sect.   Therefore, even though He Song was already capable of setting up the Small Spirit-Gathering Array, he didn’t arrange it within the sect.   Instead, he quietly left the sect once, arranged it in a remote place,   and upon seeing the successful operation of the Small Spirit Gathering Array, he took back the Array Disk and Array Banners and returned to the Thick Earth Sect for his seclusive cultivation until now.   Before setting up a Concealment Array that could deceive divine sense scanning, He Song wasn’t going to establish a cave mansion in the outer world.   Otherwise, if a Master in the Foundation Establishment Realm flew over them and scanned with divine sense, they would likely expose He Song’s true nature in an instant.   To prevent his anomaly from being discovered, He Song had to endure for now,   After successfully setting up the Small Spirit-Gathering Array once, He Song began to focus on a concealment array mentioned in the Array Tao Primary Introduction.   The Smoke Array.   This is a concealment array that can deceive divine sense scanning.   It can create illusions that are convincing enough to deceive, looking no different from reality whether close or far away.   At the same time, after setting up the Smoke Array, a thin fog would appear around the perimeter, causing mortals and cultivators who come near it to unconsciously avoid the area covered by the array.   Apart from that, it also has other functions like concealing aura and isolating sound.   After successfully setting up the Small Spirit-Gathering Array once, He Song began studying the Smoke Array.   Once he could set up the Smoke Array, he would be able to establish a cave mansion outside the Thick Earth Sect for his daily cultivation.   At that time,   He Song’s cultivation speed would surpass his current rate, allowing him to enter the Foundation Establishment Realm even faster.    Now,   after two years of cultivation, He Song’s cultivation level in the eighth-tier of Qi Refining took another big step, and the amount of spirit power in his body increased considerably.   He felt that there wasn’t much distance to reach the ninth- tier of Qi Refining.   As for the Smoke Array, He Song gained some understanding as he continued to study.   It is worth mentioning that, even though He Song was in seclusive cultivation in the past two years, he still familiarized himself with the entire Thick Earth Sect during his spare time.   In these two years, He Song visited almost every accessible place for an outer disciple, gaining deeper knowledge about the sect.   At the same time, after Wei Fan advanced to the Foundation Establishment, he soon moved out of the area designated for outer disciples and became Meng Guan’s neighbor.   Both of them are in the Foundation Establishment stage, and they built their cave mansions together, often having tea and chatting with each other. He Song occasionally visited them, and the two would warmly welcome him.   However,   since both of them had not been in the Foundation Establishment stage for very long and were mainly focused on seclusive cultivation to learn Foundation Establishment techniques, He Song didn’t bother them too much.   Foundation Establishment cultivators usually spent their first ten years after breaking through in seclusion.   In these ten years, they need to change their cultivation skills, learn Foundation Establishment techniques, get familiar with high-quality Artifacts, and so on.   Some cultivators spend over a decade in seclusion to gain the regular Foundation Establishment fighting power.   They are quite busy.   For instance, Meng Guan coming out of seclusion in the fifth year to help Wei Fan get a Foundation Establishment Elixir was a rare occurrence.   It was only because Wei Fan had helped Meng Guan a lot that Meng Guan was willing to waste these two years.   For others, they wouldn’t even think about it. Now,   Two years passed in the blink of an eye. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m  He Song sat on a cushion and after calculating a bit, let out a sigh in his heart.   “Alas, having more spirit fields also has its disadvantages. There’s too much spirit rice, and even after buying another storage bag, it can only hold this year’s spirit rice.”   Over the past two years, the one hundred acres of spirit fields in He Song’s possession have gradually started to produce spirit rice.   Four years ago, He Song began cultivating new spirit fields.   Two years ago, all of He Song’s spirit fields had been successfully cultivated, comprising a total of one hundred acres.   At the same time, he returned to the sect to witness Wei Fan’s Foundation Establishment.   Last year, half of the spirit fields He Song had cultivated had been transformed into spirit fields, and He Song harvested more than 50,000 catties of spirit rice from his fields.   This year, all of He Song’s cultivated spirit fields had been transformed into spirit fields, and the first wave of spirit rice had started to be produced.   Based on previous yields, these one hundred acres of spirit fields are likely to produce 110,000 catties of spirit rice.    Such a massive amount of spirit rice.   Even though He Song had harvested more than 50,000 catties of spirit rice last year and bought another storage bag from the sect, if he went again this year, the two storage bags he had probably wouldn’t be able to hold that much spirit rice.   After all, He Song already had more than 60,000 catties of spirit rice harvested from the newly cultivated spirit fields in the previous two years, plus last year’s 50,000-plus catties of spirit rice, making a total of 110,000 catties.   These 110,000 catties of spirit rice required one storage bag.   If he harvested another 110,000 catties of spirit rice this year, it would require another storage bag.   He Song only had two storage bags on him now.   After storing the spirit rice, he couldn’t fit anything else in the bags.   The storage bags’ space was too small.   Cargo storage bags were inconvenient to carrv.   After pondering it, ????? ultimately decided to sell the spirit rice every two years, or else it would take up too much space.   If he didn’t clear it out in time, it would be difficult to sell the accumulated spirit rice quickly in the future.   It would be better to sell the spirit rice every two years.   In this way, his income would be more stable.   He wouldn’t find himself needing spirit stones in a hurry, only to discover that he couldn’t sell that much spirit rice in a short amount of time.   He made up his mind and acted on it.   With two storage bags in hand, He Song quickly left the Thick Earth Sect and hurried toward his spirit fields.   The first stop was a valley with 30 acres of spirit fields.   After harvesting more than 30,000 catties of spirit rice here and replenishing the array’s spirit stones, He Song took off toward another one of his cultivated spirit fields.   After harvesting the spirit rice from another field and replenishing the array’s spirit stones there, He Song moved on to the next spirit field.   Thus, he repeated this process.   Soon, he had harvested all of his spirit fields and replenished the spirit stones of the arrays covering each field.   He Song’s two storage bags were suddenly filled to capacity.   220,000 catties of spirit rice almost occupied all the space in the two storage bags.   Fortunately, the Thick Earth Sect’s storage bags were large enough for him to make a little room for his personal belongings.   After stopping at his last spirit field, He Song looked up at the sky and a map he had memorized flashed through his mind.   He needed to find an Immortal Pavilion to sell the spirit rice he carried.   He searched his memory for a moment, then looked in the northwest direction and immediately took to the air, speeding toward the northwest.   There was an Immortal Pavilion in the northwest.   Named Flame Light Immortal Pavilion, it was the nearest Immortal Pavilion to   He Song’s location..

Chapter 155 - 155: 154: Becoming an Evil Cultivator Translator: 549690339   Since it was the closest, He Song’s best choice was naturally this Immortal   Pavilion.   Flame Light Immortal Pavilion.   It was hundreds of miles away from the spirit field where He Song was.   He Song activated his Mountain Wind Riding Skill and quickly moved forward, but it took quite some time before he finally arrived at the outskirts of the   Flame Light Immortal Pavilion.   However.   Upon arriving at the outskirts of the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion, He Song did not hastily enter the pavilion.   Instead, he stopped tens of miles away from the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion.   Concealed in a hidden valley, after giving it some thought, He Song quickly set up an array formation.   As              continuously formed seals, the Array Foundation flew in all directions.   Soon.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com   An Illusion Array.   A Five Phases Array.   In total, two array formations were successfully set up by He Song.   He turned this hidden valley, which was only tens of miles away from the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion, into his temporary base and controlled the two arrays, completely covering the valley before finally breathing a sigh of relief.   His gaze looked towards the direction of the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion in the distance.   Setting up an array formation tens of miles away from the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion was not because He Song wanted to stay here permanently.   It was only because He Song currently had a bit too much spirit rice on him.   Two hundred and twenty thousand jin of spirit rice.   Once all of it was sold, at least 20,000 spirit stones would be received.   20,000 spirit stones.   Not to mention Qi-refining late-stage cultivators, even Early Foundation Establishment Masters would be tempted when suddenly seeing so many spirit stones.   Although He Song had already decided that one pavilion could handle at most 110,000 jin of spirit rice, and he had to quickly move away with 10,000 spirit stones in hand to another pavilion.   However, such a practice might inevitably draw attention.   Even if he only sells 110,000 jin of spirit rice, He Song would still receive at least 10,000 spirit stones.   Ten thousand spirit stones.   It was a number carefully decided upon after He Song had given it much thought.            This number.   Fell right within the range where Foundation Establishment Masters wouldn’t care, but late-stage Qi-refining cultivators might not necessarily be able to keep their eyes on He Song.   In the cultivation world, there were countless strange and fascinating skills.   No matter how cautious He Song was, he couldn’t guarantee that he wouldn’t be caught off guard at times.   Therefore, just in case, He Song simply set up an array formation here.   If someone was really watching him.   As long as it wasn’t a Foundation Establishment Master.   With the Five Phases Array and Illusion Array, even if He Song couldn’t beat them, he could still retreat calmly once they entered the array.   In this way, another layer of insurance was added to his safety.   If he could win… perhaps He Song would transform into an Evil Cultivator and happily accept the opponent’s storage bag.   After all, He Song would never appear in his true form from beginning to end, and the name he used would usually be Han Feiyu or Lin Fan.   What does Han Feiyu or Lin Fan killing people have to do with me, He Song?   After setting up two array formations in the valley, He Song’s body submerged underground and quickly sped towards the location of the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion.   When he was only a few miles away from the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion, He Song’s figure appeared on the ground.   He Song at this moment.   He was wearing a black robe.   He had no aura at all.   His appearance had also been changed long ago.   In this way, when figure entered the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion, no one would think that this person, who had just entered the pavilion, was actually carrying a huge resource of 220,000 jin of spirit rice.   Entering the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion.   After checking the map in the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion, He Song quickly walked towards the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   As soon as He Song stepped inside and revealed a hint of late-stage Qi-refining spiritual pressure, someone suddenly appeared in front of him.   “I am Mi Cang, a steward of this place. I apologize for the inconvenience, fellow Daoist, please come in to the VIP room.”   As soon as his words fell, Mi Cang in front of him bowed his hand to He Song and led the way ahead, quickly guiding He Song into the VIP room.   In the VIP room.   Traces of tea fragrance filled the air, causing He Song to raise his eyebrows slightly.   Why is this Green Immortal Spirit Tea everywhere?   It was in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, Spirit Rabbit Immortal   Mansion, and even in the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion, the tea was present. Could it be that this Green Immortal Spirit Tea, which can increase some cultivation, is a must-have in the VIP room of every Immortal Pavilion?            Or is it…   That the Thick Earth Sect had a high output of Green Immortal Spirit Tea that could supply all the pavilions under its jurisdiction?   He Song, who had never paid attention to this matter before, recalled the output of Green Immortal Spirit Tea in the Thick Earth Sect at this moment.   However, He Song’s thoughts were soon interrupted by Mi Cang in front of him.   “What name does this fellow Daoist go by? Would you like to purchase some spirit grass or spirit flowers?”   Seeing that He Song was interested in the Green Immortal Spirit Tea after being led into the VIP room, Mi Cang decided to ask the question.   The Green Immortal Spirit Tea was precious, and even he didn’t have the authority to give it away.   Therefore, he had to interrupt the interest of the person in front of him and ask him what he had come here for.   “I am Lin Fan, a loose cultivator, here to sell some spirit rice. I don’t need any spirit grass or spirit flowers.”   Not minding the interruption, He Song stated his purpose and placed a storage bag on the table in front of him.   This storage bag contained 110,000 jin of spirit rice.   The other storage bag on He Song’s body, in addition to 110,000 jin of spirit rice, also contained his daily necessities.   Storage bags were too expensive.   Even in the Thick Earth Sect, He Song spent a full 1,000 spirit stones to buy a storage bag.   This was also the reason why He Song decided to sell the spirit rice once every two years.   Storage bags were too expensive, and buying one to store spirit rice every year would cost He Song a lot of spirit stones.   In this way, it was better to only buy two and leave the sect to sell spirit rice once every two years.   Although it was a bit more troublesome.   But at least he didn’t have to spend so many spirit stones.   On the side.   Seeing He Song take out a storage bag, Mi Cang nodded and took the bag. However, as he checked the amount of spirit rice in the bag, Mi Cang’s   eyebrows suddenly raised.   A large storage bag? 110,000 jin of spirit rice?   His eyes discreetly swept over He Song’s figure, causing Mi Cang’s heart to tremble.   This person hid his identity, and he was not as simple as he appeared to be. That thought flashed through his mind, but there was no shock on Mi Cang’s face, as it seemed calm as ever.   But no one knew what he was thinking inside.   By the time he put down the storage bag in his hand, no trace of abnormality remained.   “Fellow Daoist Lin, there are a total of 110 ,ooo jin of spirit rice here. The Spiritual Medicine Pavilion takes a 10% profit, and you can get 9,900 spirit stones in total.”   “What are your thoughts, Lin Daoist?”   With the storage bag on the table, Mi Cang asked.   On the other side of the table.   He Song’s face remained unchanged, but upon hearing Mi Cang’s words, a hint of surprise emerged in his heart.   What’s going on?        

Chapter 156 - 156: 155: Greedy Thoughts Arise Translator: 549690339   Last time when he sold 110,000 jin of spirit rice, the steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion in the Flowers Immortal Pavilion had raised the price by a hundred spirit stones for him, but there was no hint of asking for a kickback.   He didn’t come after him afterward either.   Now, the steward of Spiritual Medicine Pavilion at this Flame Light Immortal Pavilion had also given him a normal price, without any hint of asking for a kickback.   Are people nowadays… all so upright?   Or is it that…   Those experiences he had at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and Spirit Rabbit Immortal Mansion shouldn’t have existed in the first place?   But what he didn’t know was that the steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion at the Flowers Immortal Pavilion had come after him, only to be scared off by He Song’s handling of the illegal goods.   Thus, He Song had unwittingly avoided danger.   Otherwise, he might have tasted the sensation of being pursued for the first time when he sold the spirit rice last time.   With a trace of confusion in his eyes…   He Song couldn’t quite understand.   In the end, he stopped thinking about it.   Nodding his head…   “Alright, let’s go with Brother Mi’s price,” He Song said, agreeing.   Anyway, before he left the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion, he would definitely dispose of all his belongings, change his appearance at the inn, and leave the area with the Earth Tunneling Skill.   If he still got followed after doing all that…   Then He Song would have no choice but to wait for someone to track him down in the remote valley dozens of miles away.   But he didn’t know…   What expression would be on the other party’s face when they entered the Array Skills?   Thinking about it, it should be quite interesting.   Not everyone can set up Array Skills, nor can everyone break the formation.   Ordinary loose cultivators, Immortal Pavilion disciples, or even noble family members and sect disciples, if they blindly enter the Array Skills without knowing them…Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com   Given the offensive and defensive capabilities of the Five Phases Array…   As long as their strength doesn’t exceed He Song’s too much, they will be worn down by He Song to death.   On top of that, there is an Illusion Array laid out on the periphery, which can shield the sounds and breaths in the Five Phases Array.   No one will discover it.   In this way, the two Array Skills He Song set up before stepping into the Immortal Pavilion would be enough to help him deal with a lot of troubles.   Seeing He Song agree, Mi Cang nodded calmly.   “In that case, I’ll put the spirit rice away first and then get the spirit stones for Brother Lin. Please wait a moment, Mrs. Lin.”   After saying that, Mi Cang wanted to leave with He Song’s storage bag.   This action made He Song raise his eyebrows.            In the past…   He Song had dealt with spirit rice a few times.   But almost no one would take away his storage bag without giving out the spirit stones first.   But now…   The spirit stones haven’t been given yet, and Mi Cang wants to take away his storage bag?   In the Cultivation World…   Money is exchanged hand to hand.   And so are the goods.   This is the rule.   Is it that the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion doesn’t understand even this basic rule?   “Wait, what do you mean, Brother Mi? Do you not intend to follow the rule of exchanging money and goods hand in hand?”   With a trace of coldness in his eyes, He Song stood up and blocked Mi Cang directly.   For a moment…   The VIP lounge became so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.   After blocking Mi Cang, several high-quality Thick Earth Amulets appeared between He Song’s fingers.   If the situation turned unfavorable, He Song would activate them to protect himself.   No one would want to make a move against a Qi refining late-stage cultivator in the Immortal Pavilion, even if he was just a loose cultivator.   He Song took out these high-quality Thick Earth Amulets as a precautionary measure.   Mi Cang, who originally wanted to leave, froze on the spot at this moment.   Glancing at the several high-quality Thick Earth Amulets between He Song’s fingers, Mi Cang’s expression changed.   Then he quickly put down the storage bag in his hand.   “No, no, no, Mrs. Lin misunderstood. The transactions in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion have always been like this. However, if the dao friend is unwilling, I can go and get the spirit stones first, and then give the money and goods hand in hand with the dao friend.”   With that, Mi Cang gestured with his hand, putting on an air of everything being perfectly justified.   If He Song hadn’t already experienced the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion himself, he might have actually believed Mi Cang’s nonsense.   However, now was not the time to tear his face apart.   He first had to sell his 110,000 jin of spirit rice.   As for the rest…   They were just trivial matters.   Seeing Mi Cang putting down the storage bag, He Song nodded and went up to pick it up.   After checking that there were no discrepancies in the spirit rice inside, He Song finally spoke up.   “In that case, Brother Mi, please go and get the spirit stones first. I’ll be waiting here for your return.”   With the storage bag in his hand, He Song sat down in the VIP room and started waiting.   As for Mi Cang…            After hearing He Song’s words, he saluted He Song and left the VIP room.   Inside the VIP room…   Once Mi Cang had left, He Song immediately opened the door and appeared outside the VIP room.   The space inside the VIP room was small, making it difficult to maneuver.   If this time Mi Cang wasn’t leaving to get the spirit stones but to call for help…   He Song would likely be trapped in the small VIP room, at the mercy of others.   Instead of living in fear, he might as well come outside the VIP room and not give Mi Cang any chance.   Trade outside and leave immediately after.   He Song wouldn’t have to worry about any threats from Mi Cang afterward.   After all…   He Song was always cautious whenever he sold spirit rice.   Going to the inn to change his appearance, burning his clothes, and then using the Earth Tunneling Skill to leave the area were just normal operations.   If he still couldn’t shake off the other party like this…   He Song had already prepared Array Skills in advance.   However, if it really came to that, He Song would have to force the other party to reveal how they tracked him down to the valley.   He Song didn’t have to wait too long.   Soon…   Mi Cang came back with the spirit stones.   Seeing He Song standing outside the VIP room, Mi Cang’s astonishment flashed across his eyes, but he didn’t care too much about it.   They exchanged money and goods hand to hand.   After the transaction was completed, He Song’s storage bag suddenly had 9,900 more spirit stones in it.   With the spirit stones in hand, He Song didn’t care about Mi Cang’s expression and left immediately.   He couldn’t stay in this place any longer.   Moreover, after selling the spirit rice, he had no other business to do here.   It would be better to find an inn, change his appearance and leave right away.   And besides, he had no intention of coming back to the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion anyway.   There was no need to pretend to be friendly with Mi Cang anymore.   Just as He Song was about to leave the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, Mi Cang revealed a smile inside the pavilion.   “But I’m still one step ahead. The Tracking Skill is extremely fast when mastered and he probably didn’t even notice.”   “In this way, I can track him at any time until he leaves the Immortal Pavilion…”   A cold light flashed in his eyes as Mi Cang turned around and quickly left the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, heading to an unknown destination.   Messing with He Song’s storage bag…   Was a plan Mi Cang came up with as soon as he found out He Song was a loose cultivator and had 110,000 jin of spirit rice.   For someone like He Song, who hides behind the scenes but is exceptionally wealthy, if he didn’t make a move, wouldn’t he just be benefiting someone else?   Rather than benefiting others…   Why not benefit himself..        

Chapter 157 - 157: 156: Ambush Kill (3000-word Big Chapter) Translator: 549690339   Ten thousand spirit stones!   For a Qi-refining late stage cultivator, it’s an extraordinary wealth.   Even if it’s risky, he is willing to take the chance.   Moreover, as a fellow Qi-refining late stage cultivator, if it comes down to a real fight, he has some confidence.   Just a mere loose cultivator after all.   Even if He Song’s cultivation has reached the eighth-tier Qi Refining.   And his own cultivation is only at the seventh-tier Qi Refining.   But, how could a mere loose cultivator compare to him, an Immortal Pavilion steward with a fortunate background?   Recalling the opportunity he once obtained by chance, Mi Cang became determined, and a surge of murderous intent rose in his heart.   He Song did not know what Mi Cang was thinking or that he had been targeted.   However.   Earlier on, due to Mi Cang’s intention to take his storage bag, He Song had already become alert.   Upon leaving the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, He Song hurriedly rushed to the inn at Flame Light Immortal Pavilion.   After paying ten spirit stones,   He rented the inn for ten days. After entering, he activated the Concealment Array inside to hide his presence.   Having done all this, He Song removed his black robe and casually threw out a fireball to burn it to ashes.   Afterwards, he circulated his spirit power within his body, quickly washing his body and storage bags with spirit power.   Knowing of the existence of the Tracking Skill in the Cultivation World, He Song naturally wouldn’t give any opportunities away.   Under the washing of spirit power, the tracking mark would be wiped clean.   Whether it was his storage bag or his body, He Song used spirit power to cleanse them both thoroughly.   Once all of this was done, He Song finally let out a sigh of relief. He changed   into another black robe and transformed his appearance once more.   Then, he used the Earth Tunneling Skill to delve underground and swiftly traveled towards the small valley tens of miles away.   According to He Song’s thinking,   After doing all of this, he should be able to eliminate all ordinary tracking marks.   In this way, escaping by tunneling through the ground would ensure his safety.   In addition,   Hurrying to the small valley tens of miles away was something he had planned long ago.   If he did all of this in the inn and the opponent still managed to find him, Then the Array Skills in the small valley could be put to use.   After trapping the opponent, he could then force the truth out from their mouth. In the future, if he were to sell spirit rice again, he would have an extra layer of precaution.   After all, there is an endless variety of skills in the Cultivation World, and nobody knows if they could be targeted by a certain skill, causing their own demise.   As for Mi Cang’s cultivation, based on He Song’s investigation, it was merely at the seventh-tier Qi Refining.   He Song’s cultivation had already reached the eighth-tier Qi Refining by now.   With the aid of Array Skills, Trapping the opponent,   Or even killing the opponent,   Should not be difficult tasks.   He Song had learned the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill, after all.   This Sword Riding Skill had an extremely impressive offensive power at the Qi Refining stage.   It was one of the top attack sword skills amongst Thick Earth Sect Qi Refining cultivators.   Being higher in cultivation by one tier,   With the aid of Array Skills,   And also possessing the powerful Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill,   With a full set of Artifacts and spirit amulets on hand,    He Song contemplated for a moment and finally concluded that such a lineup was more than enough to deal with a seventh-tier Qi Refining cultivator.   With his decision made,   He Song’s figure quickly made its way underground towards the small valley tens of miles away.   At the same time,   Outside the inn of Flame Light Immortal Pavilion,   Mi Cang had already changed into a black robe and concealed his entire aura. He was hiding in a corner outside the inn and secretly monitoring.   However, to his surprise,   When he saw He Song enter the inn and activate the Concealment Array, he suddenly found the tracking mark he placed on He Song’s storage bag using the Tracking Skill becoming unstable.   This was an effect that would only occur when the tracking mark was being washed away by spirit power and gradually losing its effectiveness. Ordinary tracking marks were attached to the surface of an object,   And would be easily washed away once hit with spirit power.   This was also the reason why He Song washed himself and his storage bags with spirit power every time after selling spirit rice, and burned the black robe.   Wei Fan had learned the Tracking Skill, and He Song had learned about its weakness from him.   Upon noticinz this, Mi Cang became anxious but not flustered.   “Hmph, crafty kid,”   “He’s really very cautious.”   “Fortunately, my Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill was obtained by chance and isn’t the inferior kind sold at the Spirit Skill Pavilion.” Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill.   It was different from ordinary Tracking Skills.   Ordinary Tracking Skills just left a mark, and once the mark disappeared, tracking would naturally be impossible.   However, the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill, while also leaving a mark, would have its seven strange scents remain on an object for seven days even if the mark disappeared.   Seven days.   It was more than enough.   Full of confidence, Mi Cang had no idea what kind of cunning person he had set his sights on.   It wasn’t until He Song used the Earth Tunneling Skill to leave Flame Light Immortal Pavilion and quickly head towards the small valley tens of miles away that Mi Cang, who was still waiting outside the inn, realized something was amiss.   After casually casting the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill once more, only to find that the target was no longer in the inn, Mi Cang became extremely agitated.   “Well, well, well, being able to slip away under my nose, it seems this kid has quite a few secrets.”   Following the direction indicated by the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill, he quickly pursued.   Mi Cang couldn’t help but feel annoyed in his heart.   If it wasn’t for his sudden whim to use the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill one more time to confirm He Song’s position, He Song might have actually escaped.   Feeling like he was being toyed with, Mi Cang’s anger was directed entirely at He song.   Not long after.   He Song had traveled several dozen miles underground and soon arrived at a valley filled with Illusion Arrays and Five Phases Arrays.   He planned to stay around for two days.   Two days’ time.   Those who would pursue would naturally come.   If no one came after two days, then they probably wouldn’t come, and he could safely head to the next Immortal Pavilion to get more spirit rice.   However.   Just as He Song arrived at the valley and began comprehending the Smoke Array while keeping an eye on his surroundings, he suddenly noticed that someone had triggered his array.   Realizing this, He Song’s eyes widened, and a trace of surprise flickered across them.   He had just arrived not too long ago, and someone was already pursuing him?   Who was it?   But before He Song could go and check it out, he already heard a strange cry.   “An array? Why is there an array here?”   Looking in the direction of the sound.   He Song immediately saw a man in a black robe, whose way was being blocked by various attacks formed within the Five Phases Array.   At this moment.   The Five Phases Array had been completely activated, with countless attacks manifesting, aimed at the man in black robe.    Simultaneously, upon spotting the man in black robe, He Song also manipulated the Illusion Array, fully covering the valley.   After doing all this, He Song took a closer look at the man in black robe, finding that his figure seemed somewhat familiar.   Concealing his figure and aura using the Illusion Array, he then unveiled his two medium-grade Artifacts, readying himself for both offense and defense.   He Song’s thoughts surged.   Instantly, the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill was deployed.   A flash of red-gold sword light was soon controlled by He Song, striking towards the man in black robe not far away.   In mid-air.   The red-gold sword light sped away with an overwhelming momentum, slashing in the man in black robe’s direction.   He Song’s figure also started moving at this moment.   Not waiting for the Red Gold Sword to hit him, He Song immediately left his original position and changed his location.   Fighting a cultivator.   If one stood still, they could easily become a target.   Even if He Song had hidden his figure and aura using the Illusion Array, the path the Red Gold Sword took to slash forward could still reveal He Song’s position at the time of the sword stroke.   Thus, despite the Red Gold Sword still being in flight, He Song’s figure had already departed from his original spot.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com   The Red Gold Sword controlled by the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill was incredibly powerful.   However, the momentum when striking was also extraordinary.   Even though He Song had tried his best to conceal the Red Gold Sword with the Illusion Array, the power contained within it still alerted the man in black robe within the Five Phases Array.   In the next moment.   The man in black robe looked at the direction where the Red Gold Sword was slashing, a fleeting look of solemnity passed across his face.   Subsequently, a massive green shield appeared beside him.   “Wood Spirit Shield!”   With a soft shout, He Song instantly recognized the person’s voice.   Mi Gang!   The steward from Spiritual Medicine Pavilion who had traded with He Song before!   Realization flashed through He Song’s eyes.   So it was him.   But soon, the realization in He Song’s eyes disappeared, and he once again focused on controlling the Red Gold Sword to attack Mi Cang.   However, once the Wood Spirit Shield appeared, Mi Cang was fully protected within.   Seeing that the ambush had failed.   He Song had no choice but to face it head-on.   Shortly after, the Red Gold Sword fiercely slammed onto the Wood Spirit Shield.   Clang!   With a loud metallic clash, He Song felt the spirit power controlling the Red Gold Sword waver a bit.   The Red Gold Sword wobbled in mid-air.   He Song increased the output of his spirit power to stabilize it.   Glancing at Mi Cang’s direction, He Song’s face lit up with joy.   Ahead of him, the Wood Spirit Shield in front of Mi Cang had been flung far away, landing at a distance.   Just one strike.   The Red Gold Sword had managed to send the huge round shield flying!   Moreover, judging by Mi Cang’s current expression, he didn’t seem to be faring any better.   Seeing this, an idea of attacking while the enemy is weak formed in He Song’s mind.   At this moment, Mi Cang’s face was incredibly ugly.   Looking at the Wood Spirit Shield that had been flung far away, he sensed the trembling spirit power within his body. A great sense of fear rose from his heart.   With just one strike.   He Song had sent his Wood Spirit Shield flying, and at the same time, caused the spirit power in his body to tremble incessantly. That was a medium-grade Artifact!   His own strength was at the seventh-tier of Qi Refining!   Only when facing a powerful shockvvave of spirit power would a cultivator’s spirit power within their body tremble non-stop, and their overall strength would drop by as much as twenty percent.   However, this kind of attack that could send the opponent’s spirit power into a state of trembling in just one strike was something he had never seen in his life.   Throughout his usual exchanges with other ninth-tier Qi Refiners, he had never encountered such a scene..

Chapter 158 - 158: 157: Foundation Establishment Secret Technique (3000 -word long ) Translator: 549690339   Although He Song’s cultivation level was a step higher than his, he was also much stronger than ordinary loose cultivators due to his opportunities.   Nevertheless, in front of He Song, he still had no strength to fight back.   With just one attack, He Song could make the spirit power in his body tremble incessantly.   Could this person…really be just a loose cultivator?   With this thought flashing through his mind, Mi Cang tried to soothe his spirit power while hurriedly pretending to be foolish and begging for mercy.   “I do not know which senior is here. I, Mi Cang, the steward of the Flame Light Immortal Pavilion, have only mistakenly entered this place. I hope the senior can let me go, and I will be deeply grateful.’   Little did he know.   The Sword Formulas used by He Song were the secret Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill of the Thick Earth Sect.   Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill.   The origin of the two words “Mountain Pressing” came from the meaning of being crushed by a giant mountain.   Just like a giant mountain pressing down on an enemy, causing their spirit power to tremble, it was just a manifestation of the powerful attack of the Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill.   Who had Mi Cang faced before?   Most of them were loose cultivators, and at most, they were cultivators of the Immortal Pavilion.   How could they, like He Song, possess the secret Sword Riding Skill ot the Thick Earth Formulas?   Such a secret skill was the biggest gap between sect disciples, loose cultivators, and Immortal Pavilion cultivators.   Previously, what He Song had heard in the Book Collection Pavilion of the Thick Earth Sect, that the Sword Riding Skill could kill an opponent of the same level within a few moves, was not false.   In the meantime.   Hearing Mi Cang’s voice, He Song did not hesitate and controlled the Red Gold Sword to attack Mi Cang.   Entered this place by mistake?   If it weren’t for the fact that he had dealt with him before and recognized Mi Cang’s voice, He Song might even have believed his lie.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com   But now, Mi Cang had clearly lost the will to resist.   If not now, then when to take action?   Under He Song’s control, the Red Gold Sword immediately slashed towards Mi Cang.   At the same time, the attacks from the Five Phases Array surged towards Mi Cang.   Seeing that He Song had no intention of stopping, a look of desperation flashed through Mi Cang’s eyes.   A few spirit amulets appeared between his fingers, and after throwing them out one by one, he also controlled his mana sword to confront the Red Gold Sword.   It seemed that he wanted to stop all this.   At the same time, he didn’t forget to shout out loud.   “Mrs. Lin, I know I was wrong, and I admit it!”   “I hope you can spare me. I have an important opportunity I want to inform you of.”   “As long as you let me go, I can give you the opportunity I obtained before as a sign of my sincerity. Besides that, I also have Foundation Establishment…”   However, as he continued to speak, the Red Gold Sword controlled by He Song and the attacks of the Five Phases Array showed no signs of stopping.   In an instant, Mi Cang was engulfed by the attacks and shrouded in a cloud of dust.   The words he continued to say also came to an abrupt halt at this moment.   Seeing this scene, He Song did not hold back at all.   He controlled the Red Gold Sword to slash a few more times into the dust cloud before stopping, waiting for the dust to disperse.   Soon after.   The dust in the Array Skills dispersed.   A small pit suddenly appeared in front of He Song.   Outside the small pit, several sword marks slashed by the Red Gold Sword left horrifying cracks around it.   Inside the small pit.   He Song looked up and saw Mi Cang’s figure.   At this moment, Mi Cang’s face was as pale as paper, his black robe tattered, and a huge sword mark stretched from his right shoulder to his left waist.   From the huge swordmark, blood gushed out like a spring, forming a small puddle at the bottom of the pit.   Seeing this scene.            He Song’s eyes remained on guard.   From a distance, He Song controlled the Red Gold Sword, slashing towards Mi Cang’s neck.   Qi Refining stage cultivators had strong vitality.   To confirm the opponent’s death.   First, cut off the head.   He Song, who was naturally cautious, would not forget this.   And at this moment.   Seemingly already dead, Mi Cang suddenly sprang out of the pit like a carp jumping out of water, with his mana sword fiercely slashing towards He Song’s location.   “You thief! Since you insist on killing everyone, it’s either your death or mine today!”   Seeing that he couldn’t deceive He Song by playing dead, Mi Cang was somewhat ashamed and angry, and his original plan to play dead and ambush had vanished at this moment.   He Song was already trying to cut off his head with the mana sword.   If he didn’t resist now, he might not have another chance.   Out of necessity, he could only control his mana sword and launch a desperate counterattack against He Song.   If he succeeded.   He would live.   If He Song blocked it.   It goes without saying what his fate would be.   Therefore, in such a life-and-death crisis, Mi Cang exhausted all his strength in an attempt to turn defeat into victory.   However.   Seeing this situation, He Song was not surprised.   On one hand, he controlled the Thick Earth Shield to block Mi Cang’s attack, while on the other hand, he controlled the Red Gold Sword to make a light wave.   A flash of red-gold light.   In the blink of an eye, Mi Cang’s head was severed.   The blood spray instantly rushed up to the sky, and a headless corpse fell to the ground.   The round head rolled on the ground several times before slowly stopping, a pair of unbelieving eyes staring dead at the headless body in front of it.   Until his death.   Mi Cang still wondered why He Song’s strength was so strong.   That sword strike knocked the Wood Spirit Shield away, and the scene of the spirit power within his body trembling uncontrollably kept replaying in his mind.   Thinking about He Song’s introduction when they first met.   Mi Cang felt insulted by his intelligence.   A mere loose cultivator?   Can a loose cultivator of your house casually set up array skills?   Can a loose cultivator of your house cut down a mid -grade mana shield with just a casual sword strike?   Can a loose cultivator of your house casually take out 110,000 catties of spirit rice?   At this moment, Mi Cang suddenly recalled something as a flash of horror appeared in his eyes.   But.   At this moment, his head had already fallen to the ground.   He could only watch with that expression of horror as He Song casually threw out a huge fireball, enveloping both his head and his body.   As time went by, Mi Cang’s body and head were completely burned to ashes.   And He Song, as the raging fire burned before his eyes, a strange look flashed across his face.   In the age of information explosion in his previous life, scenes of pretending to be dead and then launching a desperate counterattack like this were all too common.   If he could still fall for such tricks, then he wouldn’t be He Song anymore.   One could only say.   The cultivators in this world…   No, He Song didn’t know about other cultivators.   But Mi Cang, who was standing before him at the moment, indeed had too little experience.   After taking a mental note to be more cautious in the future, He Song saw that Mi Cang’s body had been almost completely burned, and immediately waved his hand.   Mi Cang’s storage bag suddenly appeared in He Song’s hand.            With a casual dump.   A large pile of items immediately fell out of the storage bag onto the ground in front of He Song.   He Song’s gaze swept across them, and his attention was immediately drawn to these items.   Spirit stones, more than 1,500.   Two artifacts, one for attack and one for defense, both previously used by Mi Cang.   There were no spirit amulets, probably because he had used them all before.   In addition to these, there were some miscellaneous items.   He Song’s gaze focused on these miscellaneous items.   Among the miscellaneous items, there were several jade slips that caught He Song’s attention.   “Jade slips? How could a minor Immortal Pavilion cultivator have jade slips on him   Holding the few jade slips in his hand, a look of surprise flashed across He Song’s eyes.   However, thinking about the opportunity Mi Cang mentioned when he was begging for mercy earlier, He Song’s eyes, which were looking at the jade slip in his hand, suddenly revealed a hint of interest.   At that time, when He Song cut down Mi Cang’s Wood Spirit Shield with a single sword strike, Mi Cang was so frightened that he begged for mercy repeatedly.   “I hope, Sir, you spare my life. I have an important opportunity to tell you.”   “As long as Sir spares me, I can give you the opportunity I obtained before as a token of my sincerity. In addition to that, I also have the Foundation Establishment…”   He Song didn’t take this to heart at the time, thinking that Mi Cang was just trying to buy time.   He didn’t even think and immediately struck a sword.   But unexpectedly.   After killing Mi Cang, he found several jade slips in his storage bag.   Jade slips were things that could only be made by Foundation Establishment Masters.   Having these jade slips meant that the opportunity Mi Cang had talked about earlier might indeed have happened.   However, He Song soon frowned.   At that time, he had thought Mi Cang was just bluffing and didn’t pay any attention to the Foundation Establishment part he had said… He hadn’t heard anything about it at all.   Foundation Establishment what?   With a frown, He Song glanced at the jade slips in his hand and then scanned all of Mi Cang’s belongings.   Eventually, He Song still didn’t know what Mi Cang had said after the word “Foundation Establishment.”   But soon, He Song’s frown eased.   It doesn’t matter what was after Foundation Establishment.   With these few jade slips in hand, his harvest this time could be said to be extremely huge.   The information recorded in the jade slips that Mi Cang had always carried with him might be the most important thing.   He Song weighed the few jade slips in his hand and then attached one to his forehead after a moment of thought.   Jade slips were basically difficult to tamper with.   With Mi Cang’s seventh-tier Qi Refining cultivation, he wouldn’t be able to do anything either.   Thus, He Song was somewhat curious about the contents of the jade slips, Imowing that his safety was guaranteed.   The jade slip was attached to his forehead.   He Song’s mind was immediately filled with a profound skill.   “Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill.”   “When breaking through the Foundation Establishment, using this skill can bring all the spirit power hidden in the limbs back to the Elixir Field, increasing the success rate of Foundation Establishment.”   “Circulating the Heaven and Earth Qi, embracing the Yuan and guarding the   One, sinking the Qi into the Elixir Field, and achieving Foundation Establishment… ‘   All sorts of information about the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill quickly flashed through his mind.   After that, the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill was fully engraved in his memory.   It took He Song quite a while to regain his composure, and then he finally removed the jade slip from his forehead.   He placed the jade slip in front of him, and his expression became solemn.   Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill.   Increasing the success rate of Foundation Establishment?   How could such a secret technique appear on Mi Cang’s body?   It should be known that He Song had never heard of such a secret technique even in the Thick Earth Sect.   The Thick Earth Sect was a Golden Elixir Great Sect.   There had even been the appearance of Ancestor Yuanying ten thousand years ago.   But as an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, he had never known about such a secret technique..        

Chapter 159 - 159: 159 – Great Fortune Translator: 549690339   Was it non-existent?   Or…   For a moment, numerous speculations flashed through He Song’s mind, but ultimately, due to insufficient information, he wasn’t able to infer anything.   His gaze could only rest on the remaining jade slips.   A sudden thought then crossed his mind.   What kind of spells could be waiting for him within the remaining jade slips?   Looking at the remaining jade slips in front of him, a glint of brilliance suddenlv aDDeared in He Song’s eves.   These jade slips…   This could be a great fortune indeed!   Could this also be the fortune that Mi Cang had repeatedly mentioned earlier?   If so, what was the Foundation Establishment that he mentioned at the end? Was it a secret skill for Foundation Establishment? Or…   He looked at the ashes of Mi Cang at his feet.   He Song remained silent for a while.   But in the end, he could only sigh and put all the ashes into his storage bag for later use.   It’s a pity.   He hadn’t reached the Foundation Establishment Realm yet, so he didn’t have the ability to learn the Soul Searching Skill.   If he had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm and used the Soul Searching Skill on Mi Cang when he was on the brink of death.   He might have been able to understand what Mi Cang meant about Foundation Establishment.   It wouldn’t be like now, where he could only obtain a few jade slips.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om   After weighing the jade slip in his hand, He Song quickly calmed down.   These jade slips.   Especially the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill he had just obtained, was indeed a huge fortune.   Instead of regretting the things he did not have.   Why not make use of these jade slips that he already had, and make them work for himself.   To make his power even stronger.   Thinking of this, He Song picked up another jade slip and pressed it against his forehead.   Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill   “You can place a mark on any object. Even if the mark disappears, the seven strange fragrances contained within will remain on the object for seven days.”   “No wonder he was able to track me all the way from the Immortal Pavilion. So, he had such a secret skill for tracking.”   In the Cultivation World,   Regular Loose cultivators and Immortal Pavilion cultivators can only purchase ordinary skills.   However, skills like Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill, Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill, Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill, and so on.   These skills, which are inaccessible to regular Loose cultivators, are commonly referred to as secret skills.   Secret skills.   They are usually the cornerstone of sects and aristocratic families, and are rarely seen by ordinary Loose cultivators.   The Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill that He Song held in his hand was also a secret skill, much more powerful than regular tracking skills.   With this secret skill, He Song could stealthily place a mark on anyone he wanted to pursue, and track them all the way.   Putting down the jade slip in his hand, an astonished look flashed in He Song’s eyes.   “I don’t know which sect this Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill belongs to. Even though it’s called Seven Fragrances, it is colorless and tasteless when smelled. But just by picking up the faint scent it leaves behind, one can track over a great distance.”   Apart from his astonishment, He Song also decided that as soon as he returned to his sect, he would immediately learn this secret skill.   With this secret skill, tracking people or objects would be quite convenient.   Storing away the jade slip containing the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill into his storage bag, He Song then picked up another jade slip. Gently pressing the jade slip onto his forehead,   His brow furrowed.   The expected information did not emerge, but a feeling of resistance seeped out from the jade slip.    He removed the jade slip from his forehead.   The gagging sensation from the jade slip disappeared accordingly.   Then he placed it back on his forehead.   Instantly, that feeling of resistance reappeared.   After trying for a long time but unable to penetrate this resistance,   He Song looked confused, a jade slip that couldn’t give out any information? What was Mi Cang carrying it for?   After thinking for a while, he still put it into his storage bag.   However, this jade slip which could not provide any information was kept separately in a corner by him.   “Perhaps, when my cultivation reaches a certain level, I’ll be able to penetrate this resistance?”   With this thought in mind, He Song quickly remembered that divine sense would emerge after Foundation Establishment.   After the Foundation Establishment, a cultivator’s spirit power would turn into mana.   The strength of the soul would then transform into divine sense.   By then, a cultivator’s divine sense would be so powerful, he could probe without using his body.   Presumably, he could even break through the resistance contained within this jade slip.   Even if he still couldn’t break through it at that time, he could wait until his cultivation made further progress before trying again.   After all, the jade slip was with him and it wasn’t going anywhere.   With these thoughts, He Song picked up another jade slip.   He placed the jade slip in his hand against his forehead.   A lot of information suddenly surfaced in He Song’s mind.   Seven Fragrances Wind-riding Skills   It was similar to the Mountain Wind Riding Skill, but once this skill was learned, strange fragrances would follow with each step. If an enemy were to pursue, the smell could cloud their minds.   After going through all the information about the Seven Fragrances Wind-riding Skills in his mind, He Song looked towards the vacant ground in front of him.   On the vacant ground in front of him, the ashes of Mi Cang had been collected into his storage bag.   As a result, it was barren there.   Despite that, He Song still looked strange.   This Mi Cang… Could he have raided a grave belonging to a disciple from a sect?   Seven Fragrances Wind-riding Skills.   Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill.   Is the next one going to be something like the Seven Fragrance What What Formula?   The Seven Fragrances Wind-riding Skills was of no use to He Song, who had already mastered the Mountain Wind Riding Skill and no longer needed another one.   So, after removing the jade slip from his forehead, He Song tossed it into his storage bag.   Then he picked up another jade slip.   This jade slip was placed on his forehead.   He Song’s face suddenly looked strange.   Flowers Formulas.   Upon cultivation, spirit power can be manipulated to form an intriguing fragrance around oneself, having an effect on bewitching people’s hearts.   When you make a move, a fragrant wind follows. Once someone smells it, they will be affected, and their spirit power will be disturbed.   “The Flowers Formulas… Isn’t this the basic cultivation skill of the Jade Flower Sect?”   “Did Mi Cang rob the grave of a Jade Flower Sect cultivator?”   The Jade Flower Sect, located to the south of the Thick Earth Sect, appeared in   He Song’s knowledge when he first arrived at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, where he saw the names and positions of the surrounding powers in the Spirit Skill Pavilion.   If he remembered correctly, the Jade Flower Sect was a Golden Core Sect to the south of the Thick Earth Sect and a righteous sect. (From chapter nine) But… how did a relic of the Jade Flower Sect come to be on Mi Cang?   With a hint of confusion, He Song stored the jade slip in his hand.   However, various guesses immediately appeared in his heart.   Perhaps that Jade Flower Sect cultivator died within the influence of Thick Earth Sect.   Maybe Mi Cang rushed out of the Jade Flower Sect’s sphere of influence and into the Thick Earth Sect’s.    Perhaps Mi Cang got these jade slips from someone else.   Maybe…   Thinking for a moment, He Song shook his head and decided not to speculate anymore.   It is enough to know the origin of these things.   If he meets a cultivator from the Jade Flower Sect in the future, he just won’t use these secret skills.   A decision made.   He Song stored the jade slip in his hand into the storage bag, and then picked up the last jade slip.   However, just as He Song placed this last jade slip on his forehead, a sense of resistance surged from the jade slip in his hand.   Despite trying again persistently,   He Song finally had to give up.   “A total of six jade slips.”   “Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill, Flowers Formulas, Seven Fragrances Wind-riding Skills, Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill, and two jade slips that I couldn’t obtain information from.”   “Just keep them. With the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill and the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill, it can be considered a Great Fortune.”   “Maybe once I break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, I will be able to get something good from the remaining two jade slips.”   Having collected all the jade slips and other miscellaneous items on the ground, He Song privately listed out his gains with satisfaction on his face. The items he got from Mi Cang this time were quite substantial.   Especially the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill.   Such a secret skill that can increase the chances of a breakthrough in Establishment Foundation is indeed invaluable.   This could potentially bolster the influence of the entire sect!   With such a secret skill, the chance of a cultivator breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm would greatly increase.   If a Foundation Establishment Clan obtained this secret skill, its strength could potentially multiply in a very short time.   Once the number of Master at the Foundation Establishment stage in the clan increases, and the resources obtained subsequently increase,   Maybe, a Golden Elixir Master could be nurtured.   By that time, they might rise to become a Golden Core aristocratic family!   But,   He Song still has some concerns about the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill.   Such a secret skill,   Shouldn’t logically end up in the hands of a small cultivator like Mi Cang.   Even if he really robbed the grave of a Jade Flower Sect cultivator, he would still not be able to find such valuable items. So, where did this thing come from?   He Song pondered for a long time.   But he found no clue.   Left with no choice, he could only regard this secret skill as a secret in his heart.   This matter,   Must absolutely not be divulged.   Even after his own Establishment Foundation, he must keep this matter secret.   After all, a secret skill that can improve the success rate of Establishing Foundation is too outrageous.   Having put away all his items, He Song stayed in the small valley for a full two days.   Seeing that no one was coming after him, He Song packed up his Array Skills and continued on to the next Immortal Pavilion.   He still had 110,000 kilograms of spirit rice on him. He needed to deal with it first after leaving the sect.   This time,   Just like before, when he was about to sell his spirit rice at a new Immortal Pavilion, He Song found a small valley dozens of miles away from the Immortal Pavilion and set up his Array Skills.   After experiencing the incident with Mi Cang, He Song would naturally leave himself a way out.   Setting up Array Skills to enhance his power became He Song’s first choice.   But this time, He Song didn’t encounter anyone like Mi Cang again.   This time, after He Song produced 110,000 kilograms of spirit rice, the steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion who received him immediately showed a gentle smile towards He Song.   What followed was the familiar procedure of deductions that He Song was familiar with.   Deal out 110,000 kilograms of spirit rice.   The other party quoted a price of 10,000 spirit stones.   But requires a rebate of 50 spirit stones.   Naturally, He Song would not refuse this..

Chapter 160 - 160: 160: Two Years Later Translator: 549690339   Thus, after the transaction was completed.   He Song had 9,950 spirit stones in hand.   The other party had 50 spirit stones.   Everyone was quite satisfied with the result.   After the transaction, He Song, just like before, spent ten spirit stones to enter a guesthouse in the Immortal Pavilion.   He then changed his appearance and cleansed his spirit power before diving underground and heading towards his temporary base tens of miles away.   After staying at his temporary base for two days, tens of miles away from the Immortal Pavilion.   Seeing no one pursuing him,   He Song finally removed the formation and headed back to the Thick Earth Sect.   This time, he had gained a lot from leaving the sect.   It was better to return to the sect as soon as possible to convert his gains into his own strength.   Soon enough,   He Song returned to the Thick Earth Sect.   However, before he could start his seclusive cultivation, a sound-transmitting paper crane came flying from the horizon, pushing his plan to quickly break through the ninth-tier Qi Refining stage further down the line.   Thick Earth Sect,   Within the small courtyards where the outer disciples lived,   A sound-transmitting paper crane fell in front of He Song as soon as he returned to the sect.   Releasing his spirit Qi,   He Song looked at the paper when it turned into a thin piece of paper in his hand after the sparkling light around the paper crane disappeared.   “Mr. He, I’m afraid there will be trouble at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion. I’ve already left the Pavilion and am heading towards Green Wall   Immortal City.”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates   “If you have friends or relatives in the Pavilion, I hope you can make preparations early.”   “For over a decade, the battle between Green Wall Immortal City Law Enforcement Team and evil cultivators still hasn’t stopped, but it has quieted down a bit in recent years.”   “However, several years ago, the situation suddenly took a turn for the worse.”   “This time, the evil cultivators are coming in force, not like the small skirmishes in the past. Having observed them for a few years, I always feel a sense of unease.”   “I had no choice but to leave Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion temporarily and head to Green Wall Immortal City for refuge.”   “As for you, Mr. He, you are now a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect and safe. But if you still have any friends or relatives at the Pavilion, I advise you to make early preparations. ”   “Zhao Lin.”   After scanning the lines of text on the paper, He Song, who was originally about to start his cultivation, furrowed his brows at the moment.   Trouble at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion?   His friends or relatives at the Pavilion?   Did he still have friends or relatives at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion?   With such thoughts in his mind, He Song suddenly visualized the image of a little girl.   A moment of clarity flashed in his eyes, He Song instantly understood the purpose of Zhao Lin’s sound transmission.   Zhao Lin knew about the relationship between He Song and Su Yan. Although there was no close bond between He Song and Su Yan,   Due to Su Yan’s pure feelings for He Song when she was little,   And later, after being awakened by Su Yan, He Song abandoned the idea of joining the Thick Earth Sect as a genius.   Therefore. He Song’s concern for Su Yan was a little more than his concern for others.   This time, Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion might be in danger, and Zhao Lin chose to leave the Pavilion and go to Green Wall Immortal City for refuge.   He probably wanted to do He Song a favor, hoping that He Song would remember his kindness.   However ,   He Song shook his head and chuckled at the paper in his hand.   Zhao Lin might be his good friend, but he didn’t know He Song as well as Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   If it was Wei Fan or Meng Guan,    When faced with such a situation, they wouldn’t tell He Song to prepare early.   Instead, they would tell He Song to inform Su Yan to run as soon as possible.   Make early preparations?   What preparations would he make?   Would he personally go tens of thousands of miles to Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, take Su Yan to Green Wall Immortal City, or even take her directly to the Thick Earth Sect?   He was thinking too much.   Now that he had received this news,   The most he could do was to send a Sound Transmission Amulet to inform Su Yan about it, so that she could leave the Pavilion and go to Green Wall Immortal City for refuge.   As for whether his Sound Transmission Amulet would have any effect,   And whether Su Yan would listen to him and immediately head to Green Wall Immortal City,   That was none of He Song’s concern.   Information like this could save lives.   By informing Su Yan, He Song would have already repaid her kindness for awakening him back in the day.. As for what happened after that,   It would depend on fate.   After all, He Song had done everything he could.   If Su Yan didn’t listen, there was nothing He Song could do to personally rescue her.   Anyway, his debt of gratitude had been fully repaid.   From now on, the two of them might never see each other again.   In such a situation, what would happen to Su Yan in the future no longer had much to do with He Song.   As for the authenticity of this news,   Given Zhao Lin’s prudence, He Song believed it was most likely true.   When feeling threatened, Zhao Lin would be able to abandon everything and quickly flee from danger, just like He Song.   If He Song hadn’t been brought into the Thick Earth Sect by Meng Guan,   If he still lived in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion,   He Song would have been the first to run away, not Zhao Lin.   He Song did have some understanding of Zhao Lin’s caution.   Back then, when the law enforcement team from Green Wall Immortal City arrived, they both ran away together.   At that time, after He Song’s warning, Zhao Lin didn’t hesitate to flee.   Zhao Lin’s caution and the truthfulness of this news were beyond doubt.   Picking up a random piece of paper,   He Song’s fingertips surged with spirit power, and he quickly wrote several lines on it.   “Thank you for informing me, Mr. Zhao. Among my friends in Bamboo   you.   “As for Su Yan, I will also notify her.”   “Now that Mr. Zhao has already left, there is no need for me to worry.” “Mr. Zhao, please be careful on the road, and have a smooth journey.”   “He Song.”   As the words appeared, He Song immediately released his spirit power.   The paper in his hand instantly turned into a sound -transmitting paper crane, which swiftly flew in the direction of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   He Song still needed to express his gratitude to Zhao Lin for sending him a Sound Transmission Amulet, especially considering the possible consequences Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion might face.   However, after doing all this, He Song thought for a moment and another piece of paper appeared in his hand.   Since he had already thanked Zhao Lin, and had mentioned that he would notify Su Yan at this time in his reply letter to Zhao Lin, He Song naturally wouldn’t go back on his word.   As soon as the paper appeared, He Song’s fingertips surged with spirit power.   As the spirit power emerged at his fingertips, it quickly left rows of words on the paper in He Song’s hand.   “Su Yan, Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion might be in danger, so it is best to go to Green Wall Immortal City to avoid disaster.”   “He Song.”   As the words appeared on the paper, He Song released his spirit power again.    Suddenly, another sound-transmitting paper crane took off and sped towards the direction of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   After completing all this, He Song closed his courtyard’s door and quickly immersed himself in his cultivation.   At this time,   it had been four years since He Song broke through to the eighth-tier of Qi Refining.   In these four years, He Song’s cultivation steadily progressed.   Despite spending two years constantly traveling around, searching for places to open spirit fields, and learning small Spirit-Gathering Arrays, and then starting to learn the Smoke Array, his cultivation speed has never slowed down.   During those two years of running around, although the spirit Qi where He Song was located was sparse, the supply of elixirs and other auxiliary cultivation items never decreased.   As a result, He Song’s cultivation speed was only slightly slower than before, but not by much.   Now, after four years,   He Song closed himself off to cultivation again, determined not to leave until he broke through to the ninth-tier of Qi Refining.   Time passed quietly, and in the blink of an eye, another two years had passed.   In these two years, besides cultivating in seclusion, He Song had also kept a close eye on the outside world’s movements.   He was different from other Thick Earth Sect outer disciples.   Before joining Thick Earth Sect, most of the other outer disciples practiced in the Thick Earth Mansion.   Only when they reached the Qi-refining late stage were they allowed to join the Thick Earth Sect and become outer disciples of the Sect.   As a result, their circle of friends naturally consisted of the same batch of people.   So compared to He Song, who had friends outside, their information was much more limited.   Unlike He Song, even when he was inside the Thick Earth Sect,   sound-transmitting paper cranes would occasionally fly in and land in his courtyard.   Moreover, due to this,   He Song not only had a grasp of outside news, but also became acquainted with many Thick Earth Sect outer disciples due to his access to information. Although they couldn’t be called close friends, they could at least converse when meeting face to face.   He Song didn’t stand out and, in fact, felt a little more fond of these outer disciples who lived under the protection of the Thick Earth Sect.   Compared to the crafty behavior of Cultivators in the outside world,   Thick Earth Sect’s outer disciples could practically be deemed moral paragons.   Although there were some with deep thoughts, they were still too naive compared to the outside world’s Cultivators.   These disciples were well-protected by the Thick Earth Sect,   and it was likely that only when they successfully reached the Foundation   Establishment, were assigned to guard a certain place, or failed at Foundation Establishment and were reassigned elsewhere, would their mentality gradually mature.   With the Thick Earth Sect as support, such an approach wouldn’t bring any bad consequences.   Seeing this, He Song’s heart also generated a bit of approval for the way the Thick Earth Sect nurtured its disciples.   When it was time to cultivate, the Sect would provide the best conditions for disciples to do so,   and when it was time for them to grow, the Sect would offer the best support, allowing the disciples’ mentality to mature slowly.   It was no wonder that so many people wanted to join the Sect, even risking their lives to become disciples.   These conditions were simply too generous.   During these two years,   He Song had also received specific news about the possible danger at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, which had been mentioned before in Zhao Lin’s Sound Transmission.   After leaving Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, Zhao Lin sent a sound -transmitting paper crane to He Song. Based on the information on the paper crane, He Song warned Su Yan to leave Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion as soon as possible.   Afterwards, Su Yan replied, saying that she was already preparing to leave.   Seeing this, He Song naturally didn’t say anything else.   Several months later, when He Song was in seclusion, he received another sound-transmitting paper crane from Zhao Lin.   At that time, Zhao Lin was glad that he ran quickly in his Sound Transmission Amulet, otherwise, he might have died in the great disaster at the Immortal Pavilion.   According to Zhao Lin’s description in the sound-transmitting paper crane, a few months after he left, Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was suddenly attacked by Evil Cultivators.   Although Master Cheng Shan was guarding the place, a mysterious Foundation Establishment Master appeared among the Evil Cultivators.   Cheng Shan was held back by the Foundation Establishment Master.   Then, numerous Evil Cultivators swarmed the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion from all directions.   For a time, the surrounding spirit fields were destroyed, and the loose cultivators who lived on the outskirts were slaughtered.   One after another, Evil Cultivators found and searched hiding cultivators, killing them after plundering their spirit stones.   One after another, the shops were shattered by the Evil Cultivators, and their goods were seized.   In the face of this sudden disaster, one after another, the cultivators were dumbfounded, and as the Evil Cultivators drew closer, they rushed to the innermost circle of the Immortal Pavilion..

Chapter 161 - 161: 161: Ninth-Tier Oj Refining Translator: 549690339   When the Evil Cultivators gradually advanced, driving nearly all the cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion toward the inner circle of the Pavilion.   When the various shops in the inner circle of the Immortal Pavilion were ransacked by the Evil Cultivators.   When almost all the cultivators who hadn’t been killed yet gathered in the innermost circle of the Immortal Pavilion.   The late-stage Qi Refining cultivators living in the inner circle, along with the Law Enforcement Team and other cultivators in the Pavilion, quickly formed a group in order to resist the encroaching Evil Cultivators.   There were many Evil Cultivators.   However, there were also many surviving cultivators in the Immortal Pavilion at this moment.   Under the leadership of the late-stage Qi Refining cultivators in the Pavilion, both sides engaged in intense battles.   For a while, the whole Pavilion was filled with bloodshed and violence.   The glow of skills shone brilliantly in the sky.   The cultivators threw out one amulet paper after another, continually attacking the enemy.   Sounds of eerie laughter resounded wildly throughout the Pavilion.   The sound of Artifacts colliding with each other kept on reverberating.   The war among the cultivators began in earnest at this moment.   This war.   Only lasted for a few hours.   Perhaps it was because the resources in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion had been completely looted.   Or perhaps the Evil Cultivators began to lose morale after they failed to break through the late-stage Qi Refining cultivators in the inner circle of the Pavilion.   Or perhaps it was because Master Cheng Shan, driven by rage, seized the opportunity when he was entangled in battle with the Foundation   Establishment Master of the opponent, and harshly killed several late-stage Qi Refining Evil Cultivators, dealing a blow to their arrogant momentum.   After the resources in the Pavilion were completely divided and left in ruins, the Evil Cultivators who had made a fortune, along with an unknown Foundation Establishment Master, finally retreated.   However, even though the Evil Cultivators had retreated.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion had suffered immense damage.   Almost all the Loose cultivators renting in the Pavilion were annihilated, more than half of the cultivators in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion were injured or killed, and the remaining were almost all mid-stage and late-stage Qi Refining cultivators.   After this battle.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was virtually destroyed in all but name.   When the reinforcements from Green Wall Immortal City finally arrived, the Evil Cultivators had long gone.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was left in utter ruin, along with Master Cheng Shan who looked as gloomy as water.   The cultivators sent by Green Wall Immortal City for reinforcement.   Were old acquaintances of He Song.   Master Qingy Yue.   When Master Qingy Yue arrived at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, the Evil Cultivators had already fled.   Afterwards, Master Qingy Yue who traveled all the way to provide support, had a secret talk with Master Cheng Shan.   However, what was said between them was unknown to anyone.   Just.   When their secret talk ended.   Master Cheng Shan immediately ordered the remaining cultivators to start rebuilding Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Immediately after, Master Qingy Yue headed towards the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   The assault of the Evil Cultivators on the Pavilion was a serious matter, which undoubtedly needed to be reported to the Sect.   If the Thick Earth Sect does not respond.   Perhaps the next target of the attack will be other Pavilions, or even other Immortal Cities.   As for subsequent actions against Evil Cultivators, Zhao Lin didn’t know much.   He only knew.   After Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was besieged, the Green Wall Immortal City Law Enforcement Team started to frequently take action.   Zhao Lin was not aware of the specific moves of Thick Earth Sect.   But He Song, who was in the Thick Earth Sect, was well aware that the atmosphere within the Sect had become somewhat oppressive ever since that time.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was attacked.   After Master Qingy Yue personally reported it to the Sect Leader, she returned to Green Wall Immortal City.   He Song didn’t even have time to see her.    However, afterwards.   He Song heard the outer disciples he was familiar with start discussing about the new external affairs within the Sect.   Like assisting the Green Wall Immortal City Law Enforcement Team in eliminating the Evil Cultivators.   Killing Evil Cultivators could earn contribution points.   Even discovering the hideouts of Evil Cultivators brought substantial rewards.   It could be said.   After Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion had been attacked, external affairs related to Evil Cultivators had increased within the Thick Earth Sect.   Some of these tasks could be performed by outer disciples.   But there were also tasks that only Foundation Establishment elders could accept.   He Song heard that several Foundation Establishment Masters had left the Thick Earth Sect and headed towards the location of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   It seemed like they were planning to launch a devastating attack against the Evil Cultivators.   Unfortunately, He Song was undergoing seclusive cultivation at the time and only heard about these tasks, so he didn’t take any tasks to earn contribution points.   With his caution, he wouldn’t put himself in danger.   Therefore, for these matters, He Song had mostly just heard about them, but didn’t experience them personally.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com   But.   Two years have now passed.   The critical moment of He Song’s secluded cultivation had arrived.   One day.   He Song, sitting in the quiet room on a cushion, closed his eyes, and spirit power continuously flowed into him.   The spirit Qi flowing into his body was also transformed into his own spirit power through his cultivation.   When the spirit power in his body reached a certain peak.   He Song, who was continuously refining the spirit Qi, suddenly shook.   In an instant, He Song felt the spirit power inside his body grow intensely.   And with the continuous influx of spirit power, his cultivation also started to grow quickly at this moment.   Feeling the increasingly powerful spirit power in his body.   He Song was delighted.   “Ninth-tier Qi Refining, successful!”   He said silently in his heart, the joy on He Song’s face disappeared and he became calm.   Ninth-tier Qi Refining!   That is the last stage of the Qi Refining stage.   Once a cultivator reaches the ninth-tier Qi Refining, it can be seen as entering the last stage of the Qi Refining stage.   In the following cultivation.   Just needs to slowly cultivate, to complete the spirit Qi required by the ninth-tier Qi refining, to achieve the state of Qi Refining Great Perfection.   By that time.   You can attempt to breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm at any time and anywhere.   Therefore, the ninth-tier Qi Refining is also regarded as the final stage of the Qi Refining stage.   As for Qi Refining Great Perfection.   Qi Refining Great Perfection has never been considered as a stage, it is just a special term used when the ninth-tier Qi refining is completed and the breakthrough to Foundation Establishment can be attempted at any time and anywhere.   However, although He Song’s cultivation has reached ninth-tier Qi Refining, it is not an easy task to progress from ninth-tier Qi Refining to Qi Refining Great Perfection.   To achieve the spirit power required by ninth-tier Qi refining.   It’s probably going to take several years.   “Several years?”   “Counting the time, I am now fifty-one, and these several years are enough.”   “Moreover, I should be able to successfully achieve Qi Refinement Great   Perfection Realm before the age of fifty-eight and get the chance for second   Foundation Establishment.”   “However, having broken through to the ninth-tier Qi Refining, it’s time to buy some Foundation Establishment Elixirs.”   The first thing.   Is to convert the spirit stones on him into sect contributions and use the contribution points to exchange for Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   At this time, He Song had a total of two Foundation Establishment Elixirs on him.   One came from Wei Fan.    One came from Meng Guan.   If you want to start building the foundation with six Foundation Establishment Elixirs for the first time, you need to exchange four more Foundation Establishment Elixirs from the sect treasure vault.   Four Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   Given that one Foundation Establishment Elixir requires one hundred contribution points, and one hundred contribution points in turn requires fifteen thousand spirit stones.   He Song needs sixty thousand spirit stones to be able to exchange four Foundation Establishment Elixirs from the sect treasure vault.   Sixty thousand spirit stones.   After thinking about it, He Song quickly dispelled the idea of immediately going to exchange the Foundation Establishment Elixirs after coming out of seclusion.   The reason is simple.   He does not have enough spirit stones.   Four years ago.   At the time of Wei Fan’s Foundation Establishment, He Song had more than ten thousand spirit stones.   Two years ago, He Song sold 220,000 catties of spirit rice and profited twenty thousand spirit stones.   Some time ago, He Song also took the time to leave the sect and sell the output of his spirit field in the past two years, 220,000 catties of spirit rice, and made a profit of twenty thousand spirit stones.   This time when he left the sect, He Song didn’t encounter any crisis. With his previous arrangement of Array Skills, his safety need not to worry. At this time, He Song had more than fifty thousand spirit stones on him.   Although it’s not far from sixty thousand spirit stones.   But there is no immediate urgency.   Now, He Song had just broken through to the ninth-tier Qi Refining, and it will still take several years to reach Qi Refining Great Perfection.   In such a long time, the spirit stones He Song could obtain would certainly amount to tens of thousands.   Plus, there is still plenty of time.   Naturally, there’s no need to be in a hurry to use up all the spirit stones on him.   “Let’s wait for another two years, two years later, and then exchange for four   Foundation Establishment Elixirs.”   “As for now… it’s better to consolidate my cultivation first.”   With such thoughts fleeting in his mind, He Song quickly closed his eyes and began consolidating his cultivation.   Time is passing by.   Soon enough.   He Song had already fully consolidated his cultivation up to the ninth-tier Qi Refining stage.   And began to normally cultivate.   At the same time, while consolidating his cultivation at the ninth-tier Qi Refining, He Song also ended his seclusion and, in his free time from cultivating, began to interact with the outside world.   Of course, cultivation will not be left behind.   One day.   He Song went to visit the cave mansions of Meng Guan and Wei Fan and met the two of them whom he had not seen for a long time.   “Congratulations friend for breaking through to ninth-tier Qi Refining, with great progress in your cultivation, and foundation establishment is within reach. ”   “Congratulations friend for breaking through to ninth-tier Qi Refining, with great progress in your cultivation, and foundation establishment is within reach. ”   With the arrival of He Song, Meng Guan and Wei Fan looked at each other with a smile, then simultaneously congratulated He Song.   However, after hearing the congratulations from the two, He Song did not show any complacency on his face.   These two people in front of him.   Which one is not a Foundation Establishment Master?   He’s just broke through to the ninth-tier Qi Refining.   Compared to their impressive spectacle when they broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage.   His own achievement really doesn’t count for much.   It’s just a small accomplishment.   It’s just a small accomplishment.   “You two should stop teasing me. I came here to ask how things turned out after the attack on the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion by an Evil   Cultivator a year and a half ago.”   After taking a seat next to the two of them, He Song waved his hand and casually asked about his purpose for coming.   A year and a half ago.   When he received the sound-transmitting paper crane from Zhao Lin, He Song was in seclusion.   Therefore, although he knew about the attack on the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion and that the Thick Earth Sect had made some moves.   He only heard some speculations from outer disciples.   As well as their discussions on matters related to external affairs.   Also about the few Foundation Establishment Masters who had come out of seclusion.   He Song, however, did not know anything about the follow- up.   Until he broke out of seclusion, He Song immediately came to inquire these two good friends of his, trying to get some information from them..

Chapter 162 - 162: 162: Golden Elixir Plot Translator: 549690339   How many disciples of the Thick Earth Sect were involved in external affairs and how well did they perform?   What achievements did the several Foundation Establishment Masters accomplish when they left the sect?   Were the evil cultivators outside Green Wall Immortal City wiped out?   These were matters He Song was curious about at the moment.   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   After all, it was the starting point of He Song’s immortal journey, and if it hadn’t been for Meng Guan bringing him into the Thick Earth Sect, He Song might still be living there by now.   He Song would naturally pay attention to the situation of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Meng Guan and Wei Fan had also lived in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion for a long time.   They would be interested in this matter as well.   Moreover, both of them were Foundation Establishment Masters.   Their sources of information were much better than He Song’s.   Therefore, asking these two was the best way for He Song to learn about the situation.   “Evil cultivators attacked the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion?”   On the side, upon hearing He Song’s questions, Meng Guan and Wei Fan glanced at each other, and their expressions changed quickly.   After a moment of silence.   The two looked at each other again and saw a hint of hesitation in each other’s eyes.   Originally, this matter was not to be disclosed.   But considering He Song’s relationship with them, since He Song asked, they naturally couldn’t conceal it.   A moment later.   In the end, it was Meng Guan who spoke first.   “It is said that the attack on Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was planned by people from other sects, which is why the Immortal Pavilion suffered heavy losses.”   “The unknown Foundation Establishment Master who blocked Master Cheng Shan is of considerable strength.”   “This matter has spread far and wide, causing a great blow to our sect’s reputation.”   “The Sect Leader has sent several Masters to thoroughly investigate the matter, but due to the other party’s deep concealment, they have yet to find anything.”   “Now, the Sect Leader is preparing to intensify the investigation.”   “There should be news soon.”   “However, if Daoist friend wants to get involved, I have to advise you, there are secrets in this matter…not to be participated in by Qi Refining stage disciples.”   Looking at He Song, Meng Guan carefully chose his words, finally informing He Song about the hidden secret.   At the same time, he didn’t forget to caution He Song not to get involved in this matter.   There were many secrets in this matter.   Unfortunately, as the three of them were currently in the Thick Earth Sect, speaking rashly might provoke the Sect Leader’s wrath.   Thus, Meng Guan cautiously weighed his words, trying to make He Song understand the danger of the situation while losing interest in it.   He really meant well.   On the side, Wei Fan nodded repeatedly in agreement.   Seeing this, He Song was shocked.   But looking at Meng Guan and Wei Fan’s hesitation, He Song quickly realized the situation.   As Meng Guan said, there were indeed secrets in this matter.   However, because his cultivation wasn’t high enough and he had not yet reached the Foundation Establishment stage, the two could only ambiguously warn him, so that he didn’t get involved in this matter.   But… what was involved in this event that would make Meng Guan and Wei Fan, the two Foundation Establishment Masters, so tight-lipped?   He Song’s gaze flickered as he looked around.   Could it be that someone had already secretly informed the two of them about the hidden secret, and that they couldn’t mention it?   Moreover, looking at their hesitation, was it possible that someone was monitoring them?   Who could it be?   The name Master Fa Xuan suddenly flashed through He Song’s mind.   He immediately became alert.   That’s right!   Only the Sect Leader, Master Fa Xuan, could make the two Foundation Establishment Masters so tight-lipped, and to warn their own friends vaguely.   It was as if they were being watched all the time.   Instantly, He Song realized that he no longer wanted to explore the matter further.    However, even though his heart was filled with shock and awe, He Song’s expression remained calm and composed, showing no sign of any change.   With a slight shake of his head, He Song spoke.   “I see. In that case, I’ll just wait for the news to come back.”   “However, I am not interested in participating in this matter, but since Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion is the starting point of my immortal journey, I will naturally pay some attention to it. Since there are hidden secrets, let it be.” “When the secret is revealed in the future, I will naturally know.”   With that, He Song shook his head, indicating that he didn’t care about these matters.   Afterward, He Song seemed to unintentionally mention something else.   “Moreover, I am now at the ninth-tier Qi Refining stage, and soon I will need to prepare for my Foundation Establishment. After today, most of my energy will be focused on that.”   First, he made it clear that he was just casually asking and didn’t care about it.   Then, he mentioned that he would be going into seclusion to prepare for his Foundation Establishment, indicating that he had no interest in participating in this matter.   After doing all this, He Song secretly breathed a sigh of relief.   In this way, even if Master Fa Xuan was eavesdropping, there wouldn’t be any flaws to find.   Moreover, would the Golden Elixir Master really have so much free time to monitor everyone in the sect?   He Song was skeptical.   However, since he was not the Golden Elixir Master, He Song couldn’t know for sure.   Nevertheless, whether Master Fa Xuan would monitor the people in the sect or not didn’t matter much to He Song.   Even if he wanted to monitor them, he would be targeting Foundation Establishment Masters.   It was unlikely that he would pay attention to outer disciples at the Qi Refining stage like himself.   Moreover, He Song had been prepared for this even before joining the Thick Earth Sect.   That was why he never set up a small Spirit-Gathering Array inside the sect and never showed his Array Tao talent.   Golden Elixir Master, huh.   Who knows what he’s thinking?   It’s better to hide his talents than to live in fear every day.   At worst, he could move out of the sect when he could set up a Smoke Array to deceive the divine sense scanning.   With the power of the Smoke Array, He Song didn’t have to worry about being discovered or monitored outside the sect.   By then.   Before this, He Song was merely a small Qi Refining stage cultivator.   Thinking about it, he shouldn’t have been monitored in real time,   On the side, after hearing He Song say this, Meng Guan and Wei Fan exchanged glances, and they both let out a sigh of relief in their hearts.   Fortunately,   He Song just asked casually.   If He Song continued to ask, they wouldn’t know how to respond.   According to the information they had received, the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion suffered heavy losses, and no other sect was involved.   It was a plan within the Thick Earth Sect.   Even the two of them were still not fully aware of this plan until now.   They only knew that Master Yan Shan’s faction and Master Fa Xuan’s faction had always been secretly competing against each other.   But due to the strong strength of their dual Golden Elixir masters, the two factions had gradually begun to show signs of cooperation.   As for how they would cooperate,   And what their ultimate goal was,   They didn’t have a clue.   That was something for the two Golden Elixir Masters to worry about above their heads.   As for the two newly promoted Foundation Establishment Masters, they only received some inaccurate information.   Since there were signs of cooperation, incidents would naturally occur.   This time, the attack on the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was probably orchestrated by a Golden Elixir Master.   This was a scheme by a Golden Elixir Master.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m   If He Song barged into it recklessly, the consequences would be unpredictable.   At the same time, this information was known only to the Foundation   Establishment Masters, and Master Fa Xuan had asked them to keep it a secret.   This was also the reason why Meng Guan tried to persuade He Song and kept his mouth sealed.   If they weren’t in the Thick Earth Sect and worried that their conversation would be overheard,   With the relationship between the three of them, Meng Guan would have likely told He Song about this long ago, instead of just giving him a veiled warning.   At the same time, it was precisely because of the Golden Elixir Master’s scheme,    That the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was attacked by “Evil Cultivators”.   If not for the Golden Elixir Master’s scheme,   There are many Immortal Pavilions under the Thick Earth Sect,   Why would the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, which was guarded by Master Cheng Shan, be attacked in particular?   Why would Master Qingy Yue be the one to provide assistance from Green Wall Immortal City?   These two factions,   Used to be secretly competing against each other in the past.   How could Master Qingy Yue possibly go all the way to the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to provide support?   The attack on the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was just a starting point.   The real scheme might still be behind it.   As for the loose cultivators who died in the attack on the Bamboo Mountain   Immortal Pavilion, and other Qi Refining cultivators,   No one cared about their lives.   Anyway, just wait quietly for several decades, and the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion would once again become prosperous.   Decades were enough for enough loose cultivators to be born in the mortal world to fill in the various positions in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Just like the high rent in the Immortal Pavilion, the Thick Earth Sect never cared whether ordinary loose cultivators and Qi Refining cultivators could afford it.   At the same time, in the eyes of a Golden Elixir Master, what does it matter if some ordinary loose cultivators and Qi Refining cultivators died?   With a Golden Elixir Master playing chess,   Being able to die in the chess game,   Was already an honor for them.   “I never thought that the clueless first-tier Qi Refining cultivator who just stepped into the Cultivation World back then would be about to establish his foundation now,”   Seeing that He Song no longer inquired about this matter, Meng Guan let out a sigh of relief, and casually teased him, quickly changing the topic.   Back then,   When He Song was in first-tier Qi Refining, Meng Guan was in the sixth-tier, and Wei Fan was in the seventh-tier.   The three of them got to know each other by coincidence, and after a few years of understanding, formed a small circle of three.   Since then, the three of them had different experiences,   But over the decades, their achievements had only gotten higher and higher.   Wei Fan and himself had already established their foundations.   Even He Song, who used to have the lowest cultivation level, had now reached the ninth-tier of Qi Refining.   “Yeah, not like you guys, who have already established your foundations.”   Shaking his head, He Song casually picked up a cup of tea, drained it, and a trace of melancholy appeared in his words.   As for establishing his foundation, He Song was not too worried.   Now,   He would have six Foundation Establishment Elixirs available for his first, or even his second attempt to establish his foundation.   Compared to others who could only take one Foundation Establishment Elixir and then start breaking through, He Song’s chances of success in establishing his foundation were much higher.   When loose cultivators attempt to establish their foundations, they would take the risk if they had only a Vein Protection Elixir.   Those with good luck would only get one Foundation Establishment Elixir.   When sect disciples established their foundation, one Foundation Establishment Elixir was the norm, along with a Foundation Establishment enlightenment.   What about He Song?   He had six Foundation Establishment Elixirs, several pieces of Foundation   Establishment enlightenment, and the secret method of Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill, which could increase the success rate of establishing his foundation.   Compared with loose cultivators, and even other sect disciples, He Song’s setup for establishing his foundation was luxurious.   In this case, He Song’s rate of successfully establishing his foundation was naturally very high.   Furthermore, if he failed once, He Song would have a second chance.   The second time, He Song would still have six Foundation Establishment Elixirs, and his chances of successfully establishing his foundation would not decrease in the slightest.   With the experience of failing the first time as an additional bonus,   In this way, establishing his foundation before the age of sixty had become a certainty for He Song.   However, upon hearing He Song’s words, Meng Guan’s face flashed with embarrassment and he quickly encouraged him.   “Fellow Taoist, why be like this? There’s a great chance for you in establishing your foundation as well. For now, it’s important to focus on reaching the Great Perfection of Qi Refining first. As for establishing your foundation, fellow   Taoist, you’ll surely succeed in one go!”   He thought He Song was lamenting the difficulty of establishing his foundation, and that was why he felt melancholic, so he hastened to remedy the situation.   But unbeknownst to him,   He Song didn’t care much about establishing his foundation at all.   This statement was merely a casual remark from He Song, with the melancholy in his tone just a feeling of nostalgia..

Chapter 163 - 163: 163: A Major Incident Occurs Translator: 549690339   After all, they were previously just like him, two good friends who were merely Qi Refining stage cultivators.   But now, they had both become Foundation Establishment Masters.   Although he didn’t feel the disparity in their statuses and abilities too deeply because neither of them had deliberately alienated him, it was genuinely existent.   Foundation Establishment Masters and Qi Refining stage cultivators.   The difference between their statuses could not have been more stark.   It was clear from looking at Master Cheng Shan.   A single Foundation Establishment Master could manage an entire Immortal Pavilion.   How many Qi Refining stage cultivators were there in the entire pavilion? Perhaps hundreds or thousands?   Yet, wasn’t it still suppressed single-handedly by Master Cheng Shan?   With this kind of disparity in status and strength, He Song inevitably felt somewhat uncomfortable when facing his two friends.   Thus, his words carried a touch of melancholy.   Inside, his urgency for Foundation Establishment grew even stronger.   “This matter still needs to be carefully considered, and it’s too early to discuss it now.”   He Song waved his hand and did not tell his two friends about the matter he was already fully confident in.   He had too many secrets on him.   Once he spoke, his secrets might be exposed.   For example, where the six Foundation Establishment Elixirs came from.   Where the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill came from.   Where so many spirit stones came from.   All these things were long-hidden secrets of He Song, and they absolutely must not be revealed to others.   Even if the two people before him were his good friends, it was still unacceptable.   As an everlasting being.   He Song knew that keeping his secrets was crucial to living longer.   Instead of letting others feel at ease by revealing his own secrets and attracting covetousness, it was better to hide them deep within his heart.   Only in this way could He Song continue living here as an ordinary cultivator.   If his secrets were discovered.   Death.   For him, it might even be a luxury.   In order not to endanger himself, He Song had to keep his secrets tightly guarded.   He must not tell others about them.   Seeing that He Song didn’t want to talk about it, Meng Guan and Wei Fan assumed that He Song had concerns about his future Foundation Establishment.   After casting each other a glance, they didn’t mention Foundation Establishment again.   Instead, the topic drifted further and further away.   Having completely glossed over the previous two topics.   Afterward, the three of them talked about other trivial matters and enjoyed the conversation.   It wasn’t until several hours later that He Song left and bid farewell.   Leaving the mountain peak where the two friends resided in their cave mansion.   He Song walked towards his small courtyard.   His cultivation had already reached the ninth-tier Qi Refining stage.   It was important to quickly raise his cultivation to Qi Refining great perfection and then enter the Foundation Establishment Realm.   As for other matters.   They were all merely side issues.   Only after he successfully reached Foundation Establishment would he truly be able to soar freely in the vast sky and have the wide ocean at his disposal.   Gazing at the distant mountain peaks layered one after another, He Song took one last look at the cave mansion where Meng Guan and Wei Fan resided.   After letting out a sigh.   He Song’s figure quickly disappeared into the distance.            Thick Earth Sect.   Outer disciples’ living area.   Within He Song’s courtyard.   He Song brewed himself a pot of good tea.   As the fragrance of the tea wafted throughout the courtyard, He Song took a deep breath and finally relaxed.   Gently taking a sip of tea.   Feeling his cultivation increase slightly, a satisfied expression appeared on He Song’s face.   Drinking tea to increase cultivation was something He Song had been longing for a long time.   Now.   The once unattainable Green Immortal Spirit Tea seemed insignificant to He Song now.   The tea that He Song was drinking currently was several times better than the Green Immortal Spirit Tea.   The cultivation increase from drinking it was even greater.   Of course, the price was also higher.   However, in order to increase his cultivation at the fastest speed possible, He Song would not feel sorry for spending these spirit stones.   Spirit tea, elixirs, spirit rice, demonic beast meat, and so on.   He Song would accept anything and everything that could be bought with spirit stones, which could also accelerate his cultivation progress, and he had prepared some of these for himself.   As a result, He Song’s cultivation was advancing extremely fast.   Tasting the tea fragrance in his mouth.   The words Meng Guan had said to He Song earlier flashed through his mind.   “The attack on Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was said to have been plotted by someone from another sect.”   “This matter has spread far and wide, dealing a great blow to the reputation of our sect.”   “The other party is hiding too deep, and we haven’t been able to find any clues yet.”   “Sect Leader is preparing to intensify the investigation.” “I believe there will be news about it coming back soon.”   “There’s more to this matter than meets the eye…”   The hesitation in Meng Guan’s eyes when he spoke back then, and the words he finally voiced after careful consideration.   All of these thoughts flashed through He Song’s mind like a montage of images.   For a moment, He Song’s eyebrows furrowed, and his mind began to contemplate the hidden secrets behind this matter.   It was said that the attack on the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was planned by someone from his sect.   Meanwhile, the news of the Thick Earth Sect’s Immortal Pavilion being attacked by evil cultivators had spread far and wide, causing a significant impact on the sect’s reputation.   At this time, the surrounding sects might be just watching the excitement.   Isn’t the Thick Earth Sect known for having two Golden Elixir cultivators? How come they can’t even protect their own Immortal Pavilion?   However, due to the deep concealment of the other party, even after dispatching several Foundation Establishment Masters to investigate, they had not been able to find anything for such a long time.   Now, Master Fa Xuan was preparing to intensify the investigation.   Yet, Meng Guan said that there should be news soon and that there were hidden secrets involved.   What secrets?   How did Meng Guan know that the news would come back soon?   With a trace of doubt in his eyes, He Song thought it over left and right before eventually giving up.   “Forget it, forget it. They said that the news would come back soon, right? When the time comes, just listen to the news, and it should be clear what the secrets are.”   Shaking his head and sighing, He Song finished his tea and quickly entered his meditation room to start cultivating.   Of course.   He Song didn’t enter seclusive cultivation but spent most of his time every day on cultivation.   The remaining time was used for other things.   For example, learning skills.   Now, He Song’s cultivation had reached the ninth-tier Qi Refining.   There was no need to be as sleepless as he was two years ago, practicing in seclusion day and night without eating.   In his leisure time, He Song also began to study the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill and the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill.   Ejavaxt, while studying these two skills, He Song did not forget to continue researching the Smoke Array.   While cultivating and studying skills, He Song also did not miss any news from the outside world.            He wanted to see what kind of news Meng Guan said would be coming back soon.   Just like that.   Time passed day by day.   He Song’s cultivation gradually improved.   His understanding of the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill, the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill, and even the Smoke Array grew stronger with time.   In the blink of an eye, several months had passed.   On this day.   After finishing his cultivation, He Song came out of the meditation room and saw a sound-transmitting paper crane floating quietly outside the room.   Seeing this, He Song casually released a trace of his energy.   The paper crane immediately turned into a thin piece of paper and fell into He Song’s hand.   “Mr. He, today I happened to see several Foundation Establishment Masters riding spirit boats toward the west. Judging by their destination, it seems to be where the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate is located.”   “I believe that there must be progress in the investigation of the Bamboo   Mountain Immortal Pavilion attack, and these Foundation Establishment   Masters should be returning to report their findings.”   “Regarding the matter of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion attack, I hope that you would inform me when you receive news.”   “Although I have already secured my foothold in Green Wall Immortal City, the   Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion is the starting point of my Immortal   Path. ”   “I want to know a thing or two about what happened at the Bamboo Mountain   Immortal Pavilion.”   “I will be grateful to you in advance.”   “Zhao Lin.”   He Song’s eyebrows raised as he scanned the lines of text on the paper.   Several Foundation Establishment Masters were heading west?   The location of the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate was to the west of Green Wall Immortal City.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m   According to the letter from Zhao Lin, those Foundation Establishment Masters should be able to return to the Thick Earth Sect from Green Wall Immortal City shortly.   Once these Foundation Establishment Masters return and report the results of their investigation to the Sect Leader, the news will probably be released.   By then, the events that occurred in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion should become clear.   However.   He Song couldn’t help but think of Meng Guan’s hesitating expression when he first asked him about the matter.   At that time, Meng Guan said that there were hidden secrets involved in this   case.   But what kind of secrets were they? He never revealed them.   Moreover, Meng Guan also said at the time that there should be news coming back soon.   Now, the return of those Foundation Establishment Masters seemed to prove that his words were not false.   But, how could Meng Guan have known several months in advance that the news would be coming back soon?   Could it be…   He Song’s eyes became distant, and he glanced at the location ot the Thick Earth Sect’s main peak before shaking his head, not thinking any further.   Since Zhao Lin had already contacted him through a sound transmission to get updated on the matter, all he had to do was wait in the sect.   Once those Foundation Establishment Masters return, he should naturally know what happened at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   He Song put away the piece of paper.   After pondering for a moment, he lost interest in other matters and simply returned to his meditation room to continue cultivating.   This cultivation session.   Another several days passed in the blink of an eye.   Several days later.   He Song was cultivating in his meditation room when the Sound Transmission Amulet placed on the side suddenly lit up.   Startled by the light, He Song immediately opened his eyes and looked at the Sound Transmission Amulet.   “A Sound Transmission Amulet? Has something big happened?”   He Song’s Sound Transmission Amulet had only been in contact with four people: Meng Guan, Wei Fan, Ping’er, and Ping’er’s senior sister Chu Shuangshuang.   Only these four people could use the Sound Transmission Amulet to contact He Song at this moment.   Moreover, all four of them were from the Thick Earth Sect.   If something big didn’t happen, He Song thought, no one would contact him using the Sound Transmission Amulet..        

Chapter 164 - 164: 164: Preparing for Battle? Translator: 549690339   A thought flashed through He Song’s mind, so he impulsively picked up the Sound Transmission Amulet and opened it.   Suddenly, a thin piece of paper appeared in front of He Song.   Picking up the thin paper.   He Song quickly saw the line of writing on it.   “Mr. He, Ping’er and Sister have arrived at Thick Earth Sect. I wonder where you are. It has been a long time since we met, can we arrange a get-together?”   “Ping’er. ”   Glancing at it, He Song initially thought something significant had happened, but after reading the text, he let out a sigh of relief. However, a trace of doubt quickly flashed through his eyes.   Pinger and Chu Shuangshuang?   Aren’t they always following Master Qingyue closely, almost inseparable?   Only when Master Qingyue returned to sect and informed the Sect Leader about the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion affair did they not follow.   At other times, as far as He Song knew, the three of them should be inseparable.   So why now …   Suddenly, they all returned to the sect?   With doubts, He Song produced a thin sheet of paper in his hand, and the spirit power surged from his fingertips, quickly leaving a line of writing on it. “I happen to be in the outer disciple’s courtyard right now. Since Sister has returned, I will wait for her arrival in the courtyard.”   “He Song.”   Placing the thin paper with the carved writing inside the Sound Transmission Amulet, He Song closed it and then made a hand seal.   Immediately, the Sound Transmission Amulet flashed with light.   When He Song reopened it to check, the paper inside it had disappeared.   Having done all this, He Song put away the Sound Transmission Amulet, stepped out of the quiet room, and came to his own small courtyard to brew tea and wait.   Pinger and Chu Shuangshuang suddenly returned to the sect.   He Song, who had always been in the sect, naturally needed to receive them.   At the same time.   Outside the Thick Earth Sect.   A few spirit boats loaded with cultivators were flying towards the sect gate under the control of some Foundation Establishment Masters.   Aboard one of the spirit boats, Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang stood side by side.   As a light flashed, Ping’er opened the Sound Transmission Amulet and took out a thin sheet of paper.   After reading the contents of the paper, a smile appeared on Ping’er’s face.   “Sister, Junior Brother He has not left the sect and is waiting for us in the courtyard.”   As Ping’er spoke, a gentle look flashed in Chu Shuangshuang’s eyes, but a trace of worry appeared on her face.   This time they returned to the sect.   It wasn’t because they wanted to, but because they couldn’t defy master’s order.   Not only them, but other Qi Refining outer and inner disciples who were outside the sect gate had also been brought back to the sect by the elders of the Thick Earth Sect.   That was why there were several spirit boats around them.   When Foundation Establishment cultivators traveled, they generally rode with tunneling light.   Only when carrying people or traveling long distances would they choose spirit boats.   At this moment, the outer disciples who had been living outside the sect gate, or who had just left the sect gate, all had puzzled minds.   Summoning all the disciples near Green Wall Immortal City who were outside the sect gate back to the Thick Earth Sect.   Had a major event happened?   But recently, it seemed that no significant incidents had occurred.   Strange.   Thinking of these matters, Chu Shuangshuang furrowed her brows. However, seeing Pinger’s joyful appearance next to her, her heart gradually settled down.            Seeing that the sect gate was not far away, she finally replied.   “Come to think of it, it’s been a long time since we last saw Junior Brother He at   Green Wall Immortal City. I wonder how his cultivation is progressing now.”   As she spoke, Chu Shuangshuang’s gaze unconsciously looked towards the inside of the Thick Earth Sect.   She seemed to be trying to see where He Song was at the moment.   Unfortunately, the distance was too far, and despite her current Qi Refining great perfection, she could not see He Song’s location from there.   “I don’t know. The last time I saw him in Green Wall Immortal City, his cultivation was at the seventh-tier Qi Refining level. Now, I suppose he would be around the eighth-tier Qi Refining?   Eight years ago, when He Song left the sect to sell spirit rice.   He also visited friends and relatives.   He even sent generous gifts to Master Qingyue as well as Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang in Green Wall Immortal City.   At that time, He Song’s cultivation was still at the seventh-tier Qi Refining level but was about to advance to the eighth- tier Qi Refining level.   Now, with eight years passed, He Song’s cultivation had successfully crossed the eighth-tier Qi Refining level and reached the ninth-tier Qi Refining level.   But Pinger’s impression of He Song was still stuck when he was in the seventh-tier Qi Refining level.   Although it had been eight years, they had never met or discussed cultivation matters during this time, so she naturally wouldn’t guess He Song’s cultivation too high.   “Let’s go see junior brother He first then.”   As the spirit boat continued forward, Chu Shuangshuang’s words were drowned out by the wind.   Outer disciple residence.   He Song sat in the courtyard, looking up into the distance.   He saw several spirit boats flying from the horizon to the gate of Thick Earth Sect.   However, due to the distance, he couldn’t see who were on the spirit boats.   But when he saw the spirit boats, He Song immediately thought of the Sound Transmission Amulet that Zhao Lin had sent him a few days ago.   A few days ago, Zhao Lin said he had seen several Foundation Establishment Masters heading west.   It seemed that their target was the gate of the Thick Earth Sect.   At this moment.   The arrival of these several spiritual boats made He Song think of something right away.   “Could it be… these several spiritual boats are the Foundation Establishment cultivators returning to the sect to report?”   Watching the spiritual boats land inside the sect gate, He Song had some thoughts in his heart, but there was no news at the moment, so he couldn’t be sure.   He just continued to quietly make tea, waiting for Ping’er and the others to arrive.   A moment later.   The door of He Song’s courtyard was knocked on.   Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang came hand in hand, which made He Song’s originally quiet courtyard a bit more lively.   Having invited the two into his courtyard and handed a cup of good tea to each, He Song suddenly heard an exclamation from Ping’er close to his ear.   “It’s been a few years, and He Junior Brother’s…no, He Senior Brother’s cultivation has actually reached the ninth-tier of Qi Refining!”   “Junior Sister Ping’er pays respects to Senior Brother He.”   Just as Ping’er sat down, a flash of spirit light appeared in her eyes, and upon seeing He Song’s current cultivation, she hurriedly stood up from her chair and bowed to He Song.   However, during her bow, the joy on Ping’er’s face made it seem as if she was the one who had broken through to the ninth-tier of Qi Refining.   Seeing this, He Song was at a loss for words.   He could only stand up and return the bow as well.   “Ping’er Senior Sister is overthinking it, there’s no need for us to be so formal between us. Let’s go by the order we entered the sect.”   Although the two were not close friends, they had known each other for a long time.   There were some feelings between them.   He Song naturally wouldn’t let her change her title just because his cultivation had slightly surpassed Ping’er’s.   It’s better to go by the order of entering the sect, so that He Song wouldn’t leave the impression of being arrogant in front of others.    Such an impression would be harmful and useless to He Song.   He naturally wanted to avoid it as much as possible.   “Senior Brother He, you’re being too modest. As your junior sister, my cultivation is only at the eighth-tier of Qi Refining. Calling you senior brother is what I should do.”   Seeing He Song hurriedly refusing, Ping’er didn’t agree.   Instead, she seemed to be fascinated by the title of senior brother, calling him that regardless of what He Song said.   As for this, He Song tried to dissuade her a few times.   But after realizing it was completely useless, he just let her be.   This wasn’t He Song being arrogant.   It was the junior sister who wouldn’t allow it.   Seeing He Song’s tacit approval of the title, Ping’er’s eyes finally lit up with happiness, and the three of them soon began to chat and catch up.   During the conversation, He Song also learned from them about the Thick Earth Sect recalling the outer and inner disciples.   Combining what He Song had previously learned.   He immediately realized that something was wrong.   Before.   Meng Guan had said that the incident of the Immortal Pavilion being attacked by evil cultivators had spread around, causing great damage to the image of the Thick Earth Sect.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   At the same time, a few months ago he said that the news of this incident should be reported back soon.   Now, the Foundation Establishment cultivators who went back to the sect to report the news had brought back all the outer and inner disciples of the Thick Earth Sect from the vicinity of the Green Wall Immortal City.   The Thick Earth Sect is a Golden Elixir Great Faction.   Tens of thousands of years ago, there was even an Ancestor Yuanying sitting there.   Under the circumstances where they had absolute strength, how could the Thick Earth Sect allow this kind of thing to spread around? And now even more so as it’s widely known?   Moreover.   When the face of a Golden Elixir Great Faction is tarnished, if no action is taken to deter it, wouldn’t everyone come and step on it?   You should know that the Thick Earth Sect currently has two Golden Core cultivators.   If they let the news continue to spread, I’m afraid the world will know that the two Golden Core Masters of the Thick Earth Sect are cowards.   Even if they were beaten back to their hometown, they still dare not fight back. In this case, the reputation of the Thick Earth Sect will inevitably be greatly damaged.   In this situation, if He Song were the sect leader, he would not tolerate such a thing.   Either expose and kill the instigator behind the scenes to set an example.   Or, cut off the channels of information spreading outside, so that other sects know nothing about this matter.   Besides.   He Song couldn’t think of any better solution for now.   Since the news of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion being attacked by evil cultivators has already filled the sky, the best choice is to expose the main culprit behind the scenes and kill them!   Under what circumstances would the Thick Earth Sect choose to recall the disciples outside the sect gate?   Just thinking about it, He Song felt that something big was about to happen.   And it was something he had never anticipated before.   With various thoughts flashing in his heart, He Song continued to chat with the Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang beside him while looking at the main peak where the Thick Earth Sect was located.   “It seems… something big is going to happen.”   “Could it be that we’ve found out which sect is playing tricks behind our backs and want to start a war against that force?”   “Or is there a hidden secret in this?”   He Song’s mind flashed back to Meng Guan’s cautious words at the time, and he was not sure if what he was thinking was correct.   But soon, He Song focused on entertaining Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang in front of him and put the matter behind him.   Anyway, he was now in the safest sect gate within the Thick Earth Sect’s sphere of influence.   Even if a Golden Core Master came to attack, He Song wouldn’t be worried at all.   In this case.   Why think so much?   After a few days, when the news comes out, he will naturally know the development of the matter.   Since this is the case.   Waiting for news is enough. There’s no need to guess at this point..

Chapter 165 - 165: 165: Golden Elixir Demon Sect Translator: 549690339   With such thoughts in mind, He Song began to enjoy drinks with the two.   Although it wasn’t alcohol, cultivators loved tea more than wine, and after not meeting for a long time, the three got along quite harmoniously.   Moreover, the two might have to stay in the sect for a long time in the future. Naturally, they became more enthusiastic towards He Song, an acquaintance.   After a long time.   He Song sent the two out of the small courtyard, agreed to meet again in the future, and then returned to his room to begin cultivating.   At present, the Foundation Establishment Realm Masters had just returned.   The first thing they naturally did was to meet Sect Leader.   Only after they had met Sect Leader and reported everything that had happened at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to him.   Then, the Sect Leader would make a decision, and only then would news spread.   Therefore, even though He Song was very curious about what had happened, after thinking about it, he decided to continue cultivating and wait for the news to come out slowly.   At this moment, He Song was at a critical moment, moving towards Qi Refining Great Perfection.   Naturally, he did not want to waste a single moment, and besides paying necessary attention to the outside world, cultivating and studying had become the main theme of He Song’s life.   In such a state, He Song’s cultivation would rapidly improve.   At the same time.   As long as there was news, He Song would naturally know it immediately.   At that time, no matter what happened to the Thick Earth Sect, he would be able to react in the first instance.   It would depend on whether he continued to stay in Thick Earth Sect and cultivate peacefully.   Or if he was prepared to flee and leave Thick Earth Sect’s sphere of influence.   It would depend on what kind of news would come out at that time.   This wait.   He Song waited for several months.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎   During these months, everything in Thick Earth Sect was calm.   Except for the sudden increase of cultivators in the area where outer disciples were, He Song hadn’t even noticed any changes in Thick Earth Sect.   The sudden increase of cultivators in the area where outer disciples were.   According to He Song’s guess, it might have something to do with Ping’er and the others returning to the sect.   As outer disciples themselves.   Pinger and Chu Shuangshuang both left their Masters.   What about the other outer disciples who were outside?   They probably had also returned to the sect.   In this way, the increase of outer disciples in the Thick Earth Sect would also be considered normal.   However.   When several months passed in the blink of an eye and there wasn’t even a hint of news within Thick Earth Sect, He Song had already sensed something unusual.   It was wrong.   It was too wrong.   The calm before him was like the calm before a storm.   The calm was so unsettling that it made He Song fidgety.   As it should be, the disciples had already been called back to the sect.   The next moves could naturally be imagined.   But what about now?    There was not a single movement.   Neither within nor outside the Thick Earth Sect.   He Song hadn’t received even a tiny bit of news.   However, just as He Song was suspicious in his heart and even wanted to ask Meng Guan and others again if they had received any news, a piece of news from the outside world caused a stir in the Thick Earth Sect.   “An Immortal Mansion within the Seven Star Sect’s sphere of influence was attacked by an Evil Cultivator who besieged and killed the Foundation Establishment Realm Master stationed there. The Seven Star Sect is currently investigating this matter.”   The Seven Star Sect.   Located north of the Thick Earth Sect and bordered by the Thick Earth Sect, it was a Demon Sect with Golden Elixir cultivators.   Demon Sect.   A Demon Sect’s Immortal Mansion was attacked by Evil Cultivators.   Several Foundation Establishment Realm Masters besieged and killed the one who guarded the Immortal Mansion.   When He Song first heard this news, he felt it was incredibly absurd.   When did the Evil Cultivators dare to attack the Demon Sect’s Immortal Mansion?   Moreover, the strength of these Evil Cultivators was also very strange.   What kind of Evil Cultivators could gather several Foundation Establishment Realm Masters?   One should know that Foundation Establishment Realm Masters were not cabbages. Once one became a Foundation Establishment Realm Master, they could receive treatment at any sect.   There were Foundation Establishment Realm Evil Cultivators, but they were very few.   The difficulty of gathering several Evil Cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm was thus hard to imagine.   Moreover, these Foundation Establishment Realm Evil Cultivators had offended the Seven Star Sect of all people.   This was a Golden Elixir Demon Sect after all.   Demonic cultivators were not on the same level as righteous cultivators like those from the Thick Earth Sect.   Extracting souls, refining corpses, raising insects, driving away evil spirits; these matters were unimaginable to ordinary people.   For Demonic cultivators, encountering Evil Cultivators was like striking it rich.   This was because after killing Evil Cultivators, their corpses could be used to exchange for spirit stones.   Generally speaking.   In a Demon Sect’s sphere of influence.   The safety level of Demonic cultivators was higher than that of Loose cultivators, the safety level of Loose cultivators was higher than that of mortals, and the safety level of mortals was higher than that of Evil Cultivators.   There were also mortals in the sphere of influence of a Demon Sect.   Moreover, the lives of mortals were more or less the same in both the righteous sects and the demonic sects.   Demonic sects also needed disciples, loose cultivators, and the income from spirit stones.   Thus, the mortals who could continually cultivate and produce loose cultivators and sect disciples became valuable resources.   All demonic sects that didn’t value mortals have almost all disappeared throughout history.   Until now, the lives of mortals within the spheres of influence of existing demonic sects were probably not too bad. The righteous sects were the same in this aspect.   From this, it can be inferred.   Evil cultivators within the spheres of influence of demonic sects would encounter all sorts of challenges.   These were live materials for artifact refinement, elixir refinement, corpse nourishment, and soul extraction!   Once encountered by demonic cultivators, it’d be a lucky stroke of fortune.   However.   Even in this situation.   An Immortal Mansion of the Seven Star Sect was attacked by evil cultivators.   Unlike the Thick Earth Sect, in the Immortal Mansion of the Seven Star Sect, a Foundation Establishment master was directly besieged and killed by several other Foundation Establishment masters without a chance to escape.   It can be imagined how much shock this would cause.   When did the evil cultivators become so bold?    Yesterday, they dared attack the Thick Earth Sect’s Immortal Mansion. Today, they dare attack Star Sect’s Immortal Mansion, and even kill a Foundation Establishment master.   Tomorrow, would they dare to attack the Golden Sword Sect’s Immortal City?   The day after, would they dare to attack the gates of the Jade Flower Sect?   And a few months later, would they dare to defy the heavens?   For a moment, the news of the attack on the Seven Star Sect’s Immortal Mansion and the death of a Foundation Establishment master immediately caused a great uproar.   However.   As the Seven Star Sect’s investigation deepened, the evidence began to point towards the Thick Earth Sect.   The Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect were adjacent.   At the same time, the people of the Seven Star Sect found some trace of connection to the Thick Earth Sect in the destroyed Immortal Mansion.   As more and more evidence surfaced, the Seven Star Sect became more and more convinced.   “The Thick Earth Sect shamelessly sent several Foundation Establishment masters to destroy our Immortal Mansion. If they don’t provide an explanation, we will settle the score!”   One day, after hearing these rumors, He Song was astonished.   Although it didn’t say exactly who would confront the Thick Earth Sect, by careful consideration, these words could only have come from the Seven Star Sect.   What a force to be reckoned with, as expected from a demonic sect. They’re hard and unyielding.   The Thick Earth Sect now had a dual Golden Elixir expert, so what force could the Seven Star Sect muster?   But would the Seven Star Sect be so dumb as to deliver themselves into the Thick Earth Sect’s hands for a beating?   He Song had trouble believing this.   As He Song was pondering this, the Thick Earth Sect’s response arrived.   The response, however, only reinforced He Song’s suspicions.   “The Seven Star Sect is supporting evil cultivators within the Thick Earth Sect’s sphere of influence to attack the Immortal Mansion. After years of investigation, the evidence is conclusive.”   “The Thick Earth Sect never wanted to get involved, but now we’re being falsely accused by the Seven Star Sect. We have no choice but to return the favor.” “The Seven Star Sect is cruel and heartless…We, the Thick Earth Sect, will act on behalf of the heavens…”   The outer disciple residence of the Thick Earth Sect.   He Song looked up at the sky, watching the tunneling lights continuously shooting into the distance, and his speculations grew clearer.   The attack on Bamboo Mountain Immortal Mansion was indeed a severe loss, but it didn’t strike a fatal blow to the sect.   The Thick Earth Sect had been investigating the area around Bamboo Mountain Immortal Mansion for years, and only a few months ago did they find a result.   However, Meng Guan had already deduced the outcome a year ago.   That being the case,   The Thick Earth Sect must have known long ago the details behind the attack on the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Mansion. Or, even more sinister, maybe the Thick Earth Sect orchestrated the whole event.   As for why it would be Bamboo Mountain Immortal Mansion,   It was likely related to the incident more than a decade ago when evil cultivators attacked the Green Wall Immortal City Law Enforcement Team members outside of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Mansion.   That group of evil cultivators might have indeed been supported by   Star Sect   If there were already evil cultivators lurking there, fabricating an incident and getting someone else to take the blame was not unusual.   Considering it this way,   He Song suddenly remembered that when he had lived in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Mansion, he had once had such a suspicion and even dug a hole in the mansion as a contingency plan.   Fortunately, He Song had now joined the Thick Earth Sect as an outer disciple, so he wouldn’t be cannon fodder.   According to He Song’s speculation,   If the Thick Earth Sect had known about the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Mansion attack results long ago, then the years of investigation and the action of bringing back all disciples to the sect a few months ago would make sense.   The years of investigation were merely a facade, and in secret, they might have been preparing for war all along.   Bringing the disciples back to the sect a few months ago was naturally in preparation for war.   These outer disciples were the future of the Thick Earth Sect.   If anything were to happen to them, the Thick Earth Sect would be left without successors.   Naturally, during the war preparations, bringing all the outer disciples back to the protection of the sect and the Sect Protection Array was essential.   As for the lack of action even after the return of several Foundation Establishment masters a few months ago, He Song quickly reached a conclusion after some thought.   Perhaps…the months of silence were spent planning an attack on the Seven Star Sect’s Immortal Mansion..

Chapter 166 - 166: 166: Master Cheng Fu Translator: 549690339   Now that all the evidence was in place.   And it had been prepared for a long time.   Then, naturally, it was time for the plan to close the net.   Deploying Foundation Establishment Masters to attack the Seven Star Sect’s Immortal Pavilion became the final part of the plan.   A Foundation Establishment Master died.   The Seven Star Sect would not investigate it.   If they did investigate, it would lead to the Thick Earth Sect.   At that time…   By now, He Song understood that the attack on the Seven Star Sect’s Immortal Pavilion and the siege and killing of Foundation Establishment Masters must be related to the Thick Earth Sect.   In this case.   The subsequent rumors he heard about the Seven Star Sect, which seemed to have lost their wisdom, might also have been fabricated by the Thick Earth Sect.   The truth might not be as it seemed.   Because He Song couldn’t figure out why those words would come from the Seven Star Sect.   It can’t be that sect relies on its own diabolism identity and looks down on the Righteous Sects, right?   As tor the purpose ot advocating this argument.   It must be for the Thick Earth Sect to show cause for its actions.   After all, from start to finish, the Thick Earth Sect is acting covertly.   Perhaps the Seven Star Sect had been supporting Evil Cultivators within the Thick Earth Sect’s territory.   Or maybe they hadn’t supported any Evil Cultivator at all.   But after years of investigation, the Thick Earth Sect has gathered sufficient evidence so that even if the Seven Star Sect hadn’t done so, they would not be able to refute the evidence.   After a few years, it comes as no surprise that the Thick Earth Sect could come up with the evidence even if they couldn’t produce it initially.   As a result, the Thick Earth Sect’s response after uncovering the evidence and hearing the previous conversation is flawless.   The Seven Star Sect secretly supported the Evil Cultivators within the Thick Earth Sect, attacked the Thick Earth Sect’s Immortal Pavilion, and the evidence is solid.   They even spread rumors and slandered the Thick Earth Sect for attacking the Seven Star Sect’s Immortal Pavilion.   What do they think, the Thick Earth Sect has no temper?   Thus, the Thick Earth Sect had a perfect reason to initiate a war.   They might even create an image of themselves as a victim in the process.   In this way, the struggle between the two sects became inevitable.   As for the truth… What did the Cultivation World want the truth for?   After responding to the comments of the Seven Star Sect, the Thick Earth Sect immediately dispatched several Foundation Establishment Masters to rush into the Mountain Immortal City bordering the Seven Star Sect.   Mountain Immortal City is located to the north of the Thick Earth Sect’s gate, at a distance of ten thousand miles.   Even for Foundation Establishment Masters, it would take them days to get there, traveling with tunneling light.   Dispatching Foundation Establishment Masters to guard the Mountain Immortal City is to prevent the Seven Star Sect from making desperate moves and attacking the Thick Earth Sect’s Immortal Pavilion.   With these Foundation Establishment Masters dispatched, the Mountain Immortal City bordering the Seven Star Sect would be a bit safer.   He Song’s eyes were deep-set.   Watching the tunneling lights disappearing into the sky, a strange idea suddenly arose in his heart.   “How does the Thick Earth Sect appear to be more and more like a villain?”   “They force a situation, initiate wars against other sects, and then use their advantages of having two Golden Core masters in their sect to win the war and gain huge benefits.”   “Such a thing doesn’t seem like something a righteous sect would do, right?” “Or are the other righteous sects in the Cultivation World acting like this too?” At the same time, when He Song wondered about this.            The Sound Transmission Amulet that he had put aside suddenly lit up. He Song, who was awakened by the light, wore a puzzled expression on his face.   Those who could find him using the Sound Transmission Amulet were all within the Thick Earth Sect. It would have been easier for them to visit him directly, but why use the Sound Transmission Amulet?   Confused, He Song took the amulet.   Opened it.   He immediately saw a thin sheet of paper inside the amulet.   After picking it up, He Song swept his eyes over it, and a flash of astonishment appeared in them.   “Mr. He, I will soon set out for Mountain Immortal City. Before leaving, I hope you can visit me to discuss important matters.”   “Meng Guan. ”   After reading the writing on the paper, He Song looked at the distant position where the Foundation Establishment Masters disappeared.   Then he turned his gaze to the mountain peak where Meng Guan’s cave mansion was located.   An idea suddenly surfaced in his heart.   Could it be…those Foundation Establishment Masters dispatched before were the ones shown openly, while secretly, there were others like Meng Guan following behind them?   This doesn’t seem like a defensive move.   On the contrary, it seemed more like an ambush.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))   If the Seven Star Sect didn’t detect it and sent Foundation Establishment Masters to attack, the Foundation Establishment Cultivators of the Seven Star Sect would face a one-way trip.   By that time, the intensity of the battle between the two sides would escalate instantly.   Ultimately, even the Golden Elixir Masters might join the battle with a high probability.   Imagining the scene in his mind, He Song left his small courtyard after a moment of contemplation to head towards the mountain peak where Meng Guan was residing.   It was still too early to think about this.   For cultivators, a few years, or even a few decades, is not really a long time.   Especially for a Golden Core sect.   Dozens, even hundreds of years passed, which was just a brief moment in its lifespan.   Take Thick Earth Sect as an example.   The existence of the Thick Earth Sect has been at least ten thousand years.   It is unknown how long the Seven Star Sect has existed, but it is probably not too short either.   Over such a long time, countless foundations will accumulate.   Thus, the friction between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect is just beginning at this moment.   Perhaps, it might last for dozens, even hundreds of years, which is not impossible.   Of course, with the two Golden Core masters in the Thick Earth Sect, this time may be greatly shortened.   However, it won’t be enough to determine the outcome quickly.   Soon after.   He Song’s figure arrived outside Meng Guan’s cave mansion.   Just as he reached Meng Guan’s cave mansion, a passage appeared in front of He Song.   Seeing this, He Song didn’t hesitate and stepped directly into it.   Inside Meng Guan’s cave mansion.   Not just him was present at the moment.   Wei Fan was also there, sitting opposite to Meng Guan.   Seeing He Song arrive, both of them nodded to He Song. After He Song sat down, Meng Guan sighed and then spoke.   “Fellow Daoists, I have been in the Foundation Establishment Realm for more than ten years, during which I have almost mastered various skills and artifacts. ”   “Now, as we are facing a turbulent time, the Sect Leader was forced to assign me a task.”   “I will be stationed secretly in Mountain Immortal City in a few days.”            “From now on, the three of us may no longer be able to meet as often as we did in the past.”   With his gaze sweeping over He Song and Wei Fan, Meng Guan took out his Sound Transmission Amulet and placed it on the table in front of him.   When he saw the eyes of He Song and Wei Fan gathered on his Sound Transmission Amulet, Meng Guan continued to speak.   “If you need anything in the future, please communicate with me through the   Sound Transmission Amulet, just don’t reveal this information to others.”   “However… I’m not sure whether I can come back to witness fellow Daoist He’s Foundation Establishment in person.”   Sighing, Meng Guan looked at He Song, a hint of apology flashing through his eyes.   Previously.   The two of them had promised that when He Song achieves Foundation Establishment, they would come to protect him.   But now, with the sudden change in the situation, even though Meng Guan is already in the Foundation Establishment Realm, he still can’t know for certain whether he will have free time to come back and protect He Song.   Seeing this situation, Wei Fan, who was standing beside him, also looked at He Song, his eyes darkening in a similar manner.   He had also reached Foundation Establishment.   Although he had just broken through five years ago.   But after becoming familiar with the skills, artifacts, and various methods of the Foundation Establishment Realm, he probably will follow Meng Guan to participate in the war between the Thick Earth Sect and Seven Star Sect.   By the time he leaves the sect, He Song may still be in the ninth-tier Qi Refining stage, and yet to achieve Qi Refining great perfection.   After all, newly promoted Foundation Establishment cultivators generally needed ten years, or even longer, to have the ability to crush Qi Refining cultivators in combat.   Under such circumstances, he might need to leave in another five years or so.   By that time.   Only He Song would be left in their small circle within the Thick Earth Sect.   He Song and Wei Fan protected Meng Guan during his Foundation Establishment.   He Song and Meng Guan protected Wei Fan during his Foundation Establishment.   But when it comes to He Song’s Foundation Establishment, neither of them would be able to protect him.   This situation made both of them feel somewhat bitter in their hearts.   “It’s no big deal, there’s no need to worry about safety when establishing a foundation within the Thick Earth Sect.”   “You two don’t have to worry about it, in fact, you both need to be careful and cautious when participating in this event. ”   “Now that both of you are in the early stage of Foundation Establishment, if you encounter someone you can’t handle, you should quickly escape.”   Seeing that Meng Guan and Wei Fan seemed to feel guilty, He Song didn’t take it to heart. After casually comforting them, he even gave them some advice.   Sect wars are not a trivial matter.   Whether it’s Meng Guan or Wei Fan.   When sent to the front lines, they might face no pressure when dealing with Qi Refining cultivators.   But if they casually encounter a Foundation Establishment master, with their recent breakthroughs into Foundation Establishment Realm, barely a little over ten years of experience, they might not be able to defeat anyone.   Under such circumstances, He Song couldn’t help but remind his two good friends for their safety.   “Don’t worry, my dharma title, Master Duan Hun, is not for nothing.”   However. facing He Song’s reminder. Meng Glian didn’t seem to care- He even   mentioned his dharma title.   Speaking of dharma titles.   Meng Guan quickly turned his attention to Wei Fan.   “It seems brother Wei has not yet chosen a dharma title for himself. Have you thought about what title you would like to use in the future?”   Basically, all Foundation Establishment cultivators would give themselves a nice sounding Dharma title.   Like Meng Guan, who continued to use his dharma title from the Qi Refining stage, calling himself Master Duan Hun.   As for wei Fan.   Although he had broken through to Foundation Establishment for five years, he spent these five years in the Thick Earth Sect, familiarizing himself with various aspects of the Foundation Establishment Realm, only interacting with He Song and Meng Guan, and not dealing with others.   As a result, he hasn’t had a chance to give himself a Dharma title until Meng Guan brought it up now.   “I haven’t thought about it, but when I broke through to Foundation Establishment, I was fortunate to have the help of two good friends. Thanks to their support, I was able to break through, I suppose you can call it being blessed. If that’s the case, I’ll call myself Master Cheng Fu.”   Wei Fan seemed to have a draft prepared, and when Meng Guan asked, he immediately gave himself a Dharma title..        

Chapter 167: Chapter 167: Great Fortune   Translator: 549690339   Upon hearing this, He Song and Meng Guan immediately shook their heads and laughed.   They originally thought that there was some reason why Wei Fan hadnt given himself a dharma title in five years.   However, as soon as they asked, Wei Fan already spoke out the dharma title he had thought of long ago.   He had already thought of this dharma title.   Were they just waiting for the two of them to ask?   Nevertheless, considering that Wei Fan still cherished their friendship and even included them in his dharma title, He Song and Meng Guan exchanged glances and saw a touch of emotion in each others eyes.   Master Cheng Fu, this dharma title.   The implied meaning behind it represents the mutual assistance of their small circle.   Alright, alright, lets continue to call each other as we used to. As for the dharma title of Master Cheng Fu, as long as you know its me when someone mentions it in the future, thats enough.   Seeing that He Song and Meng Guan seemed to want to say something, Wei Fan quickly interrupted them and expressed his thoughts with a wave of his hand.   Their small circle had been established for too long.   Their titles remained unchanged since Meng Guans Foundation Establishment.   Now that it was Wei Fans turn, he naturally didnt want to change their titles either.   Seeing Wei Fan like this,   With the issue of the dharma title resolved.   Meng Guan was about to be stationed in Mountain Immortal City.   At this moment, He Song and Wei Fan, who had come to see him off, naturally did not leave but stayed in Meng Guans cave mansion, making their last farewells.   After today,   Meng Guans going to Mountain Immortal City, and it might take many years before they see each other again.   Wei Fan might also leave the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion in five years and go to Mountain Immortal City to join the war between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect.   As a Foundation Establishment Master, This is unavoidable.   The three of them understood this very well.   As members of the Thick Earth Sect enjoying the abundant resources provided by the sect, they naturally had to fight for it.   Qi Refining disciples received spirit stones and other cultivation resources every year, with an annual salary of over a thousand spirit stones. Foundation Establishment Elders had an annual salary of 3,000 spirit stones.   With so many resources scattered around, if there are no returns, even the Thick Earth Sect with its large foundation and business would not be kind.   In ordinary times, it didnt matter if they slacked off a bit.   However, when there is war, the Foundation Establishment Masters cultivated by the sect naturally have to contribute their efforts.   Even those who join the Thick Earth Sect after Foundation Establishment have to contribute their efforts.   He Song and Meng Guan reluctantly said goodbye.   But a hint of retreat had already formed in their minds.   As an everlasting being,   He Song only needed to cultivate slowly, and his own strength would naturally improve.   For other cultivators, a sect war might lead to death, but it could also be a great fortune.   Perhaps, it is this opportunity that allows a cultivator who was originally stuck in the early stage of Foundation Establishment to suddenly soar to the late stage.   Perhaps, it is this opportunity that allows a cultivator who was originally stuck in the Qi-refining late stage to suddenly break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Perhaps, it is this opportunity that allows a cultivator who has been struggling to break through to the Qi-refining late stage to have the chance to break through and step into the Foundation Establishment stage.   With this opportunity, they may be able to achieve Foundation Establishment and become a respected Foundation Establishment Master.   Just like Meng Guan before.   Wasnt it because of a war between the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team and Evil Cultivators that he gained a huge opportunity and gained the chance to enter the Foundation Establishment Realm?    He even seized this opportunity later and successfully broke through to Foundation Establishment, changing his destiny and the people around him.   He Song and Wei Fan also benefited from this. For other cultivators,   A sect war is both a crisis and an opportunity.   If they can seize the opportunity in this crisis, they may be able to soar to the skies. However,   For He Song, an everlasting being,   In an event like a sect war that is both a crisis and an opportunity, he only sees the crisis.   After his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment, he would only be at the bottom of the hierarchy in ten years.   In fights, he is afraid that he would not be able to win against anyone.   Moreover, the Seven Star Sect has Golden Core Masters in its ranks.   If they take a disliking to him and send a sword in his direction, wouldnt he just die and be extinguished on the spot?   Opportunity?   What opportunity?   As an everlasting being who can simply get stronger by slowly cultivating, what opportunities do I need?   All living beings fight for their lives for opportunities.   Thats because their lives are short and they die if they dont struggle!   But Im different.   If I struggle, thats when I truly die.   As long as I can cultivate slowly and live, one day I will become an immortal.   With such an idea suddenly flashing through his mind, He Song became even more determined to avoid this sect war.   As an everlasting being, he doesnt need to be so desperate.   Regarding the sect war, which contains both crisis and opportunity for other cultivators, it is like a death talisman for him.   Instead of learning from ordinary cultivators to fight with all their might,   It would be better to save his useful life and wait until his cultivation level is higher before making up for the Thick Earth Sect.   At this thought.   He Song looked at the main peak where the Thick Earth Sect was located, and had no intention of participating in the upcoming sect battle.   However, he soon began to think about how he could avoid this sect battle.   Show off his array tao talent to attract attention and avoid the battle?   As soon as the idea came to his mind, He Song immediately rejected it.   If he wanted to reveal his talent, he would have done so long ago.   After revealing it, he might still become an inner disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, and his treatment might even be better than now.   Unfortunately.eastern fantasy   For the sake of his safety, He Song could not possibly expose his talent.   Besides, revealing it might also lead to assassination attempts from the Seven Star Sect.   Wouldnt that be more unjust?   With this in mind, He Song pondered, but he couldnt figure out how he could break through to Foundation Establishment and avoid the battle.   Currently, He Song was an outer disciple of the Thick Earth Sect.   As an outer disciple, he naturally enjoyed the resources of the sect.   Once he broke through to the Foundation Establishment as an outer disciple, he would immediately become an elder in the Thick Earth Sect and join Master Fa Xuans side as a Foundation Establishment elder.   After ten years.   He would be sent to Mountain Immortal City to guard it, just like Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   By then    As He Song was deep in thought, Meng Guans voice suddenly rang in his ear.   Mr. He, Ill be leaving now. If you need anything, feel free to contact me through Sound Transmission Amulet.   As his voice fell, He Song looked up and saw Meng Guans figure shooting out   like an arrow, heading out.   Perhaps because the trip had to be kept secret, he didnt use his Foundation Establishment Realm tunneling skill, but chose to travel on foot to Mountain Immortal City instead.   Watching Meng Guans figure quickly become a small dot.   He Song opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but then decided to remain silent.   Meng Guan left.   After watching Meng Guans figure leave the mountain gate of the Thick Earth Sect,   He Song greeted Wei Fan, who was also watching Meng Guan leave, then returned to his own courtyard.   Outer disciple residence.   In He Songs courtyard.   He was sitting at the table once again, with a freshly brewed pot of tea in front of him.   Tea fragrances filled the air.   But at this moment, He Song had no interest in tasting the tea.   All he could think about was how he could avoid the sect battle after breaking through to Foundation Establishment Realm.   Although he was now a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, He Songs priority was always his safety.   If it werent for the fact that the Thick Earth Sect had two Golden Elixir Masters, ensuring that he was safe within the sect, he might have already left the Thick Earth Sect and gone to another sects territory.   Sect battles werent a trivial matter.   Those with insufficient strength could likely die.   As someone about to reach Foundation Establishment, he didnt want to participate in the war between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect.   Therefore, finding a way to avoid the sect battle after Foundation Establishment had become his main concern.   Forget it, forget it. I can always study the Smoke Array more quickly, then leave the sect to break through Foundation Establishment.   Breaking through Foundation Establishment outside the sect should prevent me from being targeted.   Its just, if I do that, I wont be able to acquire the cultivation skills and skills for the Foundation Establishment.   After much thought, He Song could only come up with this method that wasnt really a solution.   Its certain that, if he reached Foundation Establishment within the sect, he would be targeted.   Breaking through to Foundation Establishment would create a whirlpool of spirit Qi, which would alert others nearby.   But.   If he didnt break through within the sect and did it outside, although he had the protection of the Small Spirit-Gathering Array and the Smoke Array, he would have trouble obtaining the Foundation Establishment techniques and skills.   In that case, he would only have the Foundation Establishment Realm but not the means, and his strength might not be fully utilized.   In this situation, it was also hard for He Song to obtain these things.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates   So, this method could only be called a non-solution.   If he couldnt think of any better solutions later, He Song might have to resort to this.   As for now.   Theres still time. He Song decided to put this matter aside for the time being and think about the solution in the future.   He believed that with several more years to think, he could find a feasible solution.   However.   Just as He Song was preparing to ponder on the matter later, there was a sudden loud dong.   A bell rang in his ears.   As the loud bell sounded,   He Song looked up and saw the other outer disciples living in the nearby courtyards all standing on high ground.   Seeing this, He Song was surprised, but he also followed suit and stood at the highest point in his courtyard.   Far away.   With the sound of the bell, a tunneling light also flew in from a distance and stopped in midair not far from the outer disciple residential area..

Chapter 168: Chapter 168: Outer Disciple Competition   Translator: 549690339   The light scattered, revealing a figure in green robes.   As all outer disciples have returned to the sect, the Sect Leader has ordered an Outer Disciple Competition to be held in three months time. All outer disciples are allowed to participate.   The top ten will each receive a Foundation Establishment Elixir!   The top three will become inner disciples!   The first-place winner will become a disciple under the Sect Leader!   I hope you all prepare well and strive for first place.   After leaving those words behind, the figure in green robes turned into a tunneling light and vanished into the distance.   At the moment the figure in green robes disappeared,   Outer disciples who heard his words suddenly became agitated.   He Song didnt even need to listen to figure out what these outer disciples were saying.   It probably revolved around their desires to compete for rankings in the upcoming Outer Disciple Competition.   He didnt bother to listen.   After learning about the competition, He Song rushed out of his courtyard directly towards the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect.   Its not that He Song felt the competition was unfair and wanted to meet the Sect Leader.   But because when he heard of the rewards for the competition, a Foundation Establishment Elixir, he had a bad feeling in his heart.   Could it be that these Foundation Establishment Elixirs are all the stock left within the sects treasury?   If thats the case,   He currently only has two Foundation Establishment Elixirs and slightly more than 50,000 spirit stones on him.   What if there are no more Foundation Establishment Elixirs in the sect treasury when its time for him to establish his foundation?   With that thought,   Thus, upon learning about the Outer Disciple Competition and the rewards, he immediately left his courtyard and headed to the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect.   Soon,   He Song arrived at the base of the sects main peak.   With a thought, he summoned his disciple order.   After using the disciple order to connect to the sects treasury, He Song immediately began to operate it.   First, he exchanged 45,000 spirit stones for 300 contribution points.   Then, he used these 300 contribution points to exchange for three Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   After putting the three exchanged Foundation Establishment Elixirs into his storage pouch, He Song exhaled, and a weight was immediately lifted from his heart.   With these three Foundation Establishment Elixirs, he now had five in total.   Now, he only needed to obtain one more Foundation Establishment Elixir to maximize his chance of successfully establishing his foundation for the first time.   He looked at the remaining spirit stones on him.   There were only slightly over 7,000 spirit stones left.   He Song frowned, as this number of spirit stones was not enough to exchange for another Foundation Establishment Elixir.   Seeing this, He Song thought it over and then proceeded towards the sects entrance.   It had already been a year since he last sold his spirit rice. At this moment, he had 110,000 jin of spirit rice in his storage pouch.   All he needed to do was leave the sect and sell the rice to obtain 10,000 spirit stones.   Together with the remaining 7,000 spirit stones on him,   He could exchange for another Foundation Establishment Elixir.   In this case,   His original two Foundation Establishment Elixirs, combined with the three just exchanged, and this additional elixir, would make six Foundation Establishment Elixirs in total.    With six Foundation Establishment Elixirs, He Song would have enough for his first attempt at Foundation Establishment.   However,   When He Song approached the Thick Earth Sects entrance, intending to leave and sell his spirit rice,   He was suddenly stopped.   Please return, junior brother. The Sect Leader has ordered that outer disciples are not allowed to leave the sect. I apologize.   Seeing the situation, He Song could only return to his courtyard disheartenedly.   But,   Upon returning to his courtyard, He Songs eyebrows gradually furrowed.   Things were difficult!   Although he wasnt certain whether the ten Foundation Establishment Elixirs given out in the competition were the last of the sects stock, He currently only had five Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   He needed to find a way to obtain one more.   But right now, the Sect Leader had forbidden outer disciples from leaving the sect, so He Song couldnt sell his spirit rice or collect more from his 100-acre spirit field.   As such, He Songs source of spirit stones was cut off.   Under these circumstances,   If he didnt find a way to sneak out of the sect, not to mention leaving the sect to establish his foundation, He Songs success rate for foundation establishment would decrease.   Fortunately, those guarding the entrance are just outer disciples in the Qi Refining stage, who have not yet developed divine sense. I should be able to use the Earth Tunneling Skill to leave. Quickly, He Song thought of a solution.   Earth Tunneling Skill.   Although commonly seen within the Thick Earth Sect,   Because there was the Earthshaking Skill, a skill specifically designed to counter the Earth Tunneling Skill, there were fewer cultivators who practiced the Earth Tunneling Skill.   In addition, He Song usually activated the Breath Concealment Formulas after tunneling underground, resulting in high concealment. At least Qi Refining disciples would definitely not be able to detect him.   Therefore, upon learning that the guards at the entrance were merely Qi Refining disciples, He Song considered using the Earth Tunneling Skill to leave the sect.   Day and night defenses cant protect against internal thieves.   A Thick Earth Sect disciple wanting to leave the sect quietly isnt easy, but there are ways to do it.   He Songs cultivation had now reached the ninth-tier Qi Refining stage.   When using the Earth Tunneling Skill, he could tunnel ten meters underground, greatly increasing his concealment.   Combined with Breath Concealment Formulas.   Even if it were a Foundation Establishment Master, they would not be able to detect He Song if they didnt constantly extend their divine sense into the ground.   There were two Golden Elixir Masters presiding over the sect.   Thus, the Sect Protection Array was not activated.   It would only be activated when powerful enemies attacked.   With the presence of two Golden Elixir Masters, Thick Earth Sect didnt need to worry about being attacked at all.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   Below the Golden Elixir realm, even a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator would be powerless against a Golden Elixir Master.   Under such circumstances, the Thick Earth Sect had no need to constantly activate the Sect Protection Array.   Naturally, He Song was given the opportunity to leave the sect.   Of course, it was impossible to use the Earth Tunneling Skill within the sect.   Almost every area within the Thick Earth Sect had been fortified with skills, making it impossible for the Earth Tunneling Skill to penetrate.   Both the mountains and the land were like this.   Therefore, if He Song wanted to sell the spirit rice outside the sect, he had to go to the outskirts of the mountain gate.   No sooner said than done.   He Song quickly left the area where outer disciples resided and headed towards the outskirts of the mountain gate.   Once he arrived at the outskirts, He Song immediately tunneled into the ground and activated the Breath Concealment Formulas, swiftly tunneling away from the mountain gate.   It didnt take long.   He Song had left the boundary of Thick Earth Sects mountain gate.    It was only after he had tunneled dozens of miles away that He Song let out a sigh of relief, slightly poking his head out to check his current location. At this moment, He Song was dozens of miles away from the Thick Earth Sects mountain gate.   Looking at the vast world before him, a flash of delight crossed He Songs eyes.   He had initially doubted whether he could tunnel out of the Thick Earth Sects mountain gate, but now, seeing that he had indeed left it behind, he knew he had succeeded.   If he could leave this time,   Then he could leave next time too.   Harvesting spirit rice every year, selling it for spirit stones, exchanging spirit stones for contribution points, and contribution points for Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   In this way, He Songs path to Foundation Establishment would be incredibly smooth.   With this in mind, He Song once again tunneled into the ground, heading towards a distant Immortal Pavilion.   The most important thing now was, to sell the 110,000 catties of spirit rice he had on him.   Then, return to the sect and exchange it for a Foundation Establishment Elixir.   In this way, He Song would have six Foundation Establishment Elixirs, so even if all the Elixirs offered as rewards for this upcoming Outer Disciple Competition were really just Foundation Establishment Elixirs, he wouldnt be affected.   Measuring up to participate in the Outer Disciple Competition and win a Foundation Establishment Elixir?   He Song hadnt even thought about it.   An everlasting being like him wouldnt take such risks or strive for attention.   Living a stable life and growing stronger was what He Song truly wanted.   Only when he became unrivaled in the world, could He Song perhaps reveal his greatness before everyone.   As for now?   He Song didnt even bother to glance at the so-called Outer Disciple Competition.   Several days later,   He Song had finished selling all the spirit rice on him.   And he used earth tunneling to return to the Thick Earth Sect.   At this point, He Song had more than 17,000 spirit stones on him.   After spending 15,000 spirit stones to exchange for a Foundation Establishment Elixir at the sects treasure house, He Songs heart finally relaxed completely.   Although the spirit stones on him were reduced to just over 2,000 after this expenditure, he now had six Foundation Establishment Elixirs in hand.   From now on, even if the Outer Disciple Competition were to release a hundred Foundation Establishment Elixirs, it wouldnt concern He Song at all.   In any case, he had the six Foundation Establishment Elixirs necessary for his first attempt at Foundation Establishment.   Even if he failed the first attempt, his second try would be after several years.   Over such a long period, He Song didnt believe that there would be no Foundation Establishment Elixirs added to the Thick Earth Sects treasure house.   With six Foundation Establishment Elixirs in hand,   He Song felt relieved and naturally fell into a state of cultivation.   It was worth mentioning that,   three years ago, when He Song killed Mi Cang and plundered the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill from him, he had already trained it to the point where he could use it at will without diminishing its power.   The Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill could be used without practicing the main   Jade Flower Sect cultivation skill of the Flowers Formulas, and its power would not be diminished either.   After testing it,   He Song found that he just needed to pinch a simple gesture, and a tracking mark would be created. As long as the mark was not dispelled, he could use the Seven Fragrance Tracking Skill to track the targets location at any time.   Whether it was clothing, storage bags, or even a single strand of hair, it would work.   If the mark was removed but not the marked item, he could still track the targets location within seven days.   In this way, He Song could conveniently track anything he wanted to in the future.eastern fantasy   Moreover, it was a secret skill, far more powerful than ordinary Tracking Skills.   However, he couldnt use it in front of people from the Jade Flower Sect.   Otherwise, they might recognize the origin of this skill, and He Song would inevitably face some trouble.   Time flew by in the blink of an eye.   In a flash, three months had passed.   On this day,   The Outer Disciple Competition of the Thick Earth Sect was in full swing, but He Song was still deep in cultivation..

Chapter 169 - 169: 169: Path to Death Translator: 549690339   As for the Outer Disciple Competition, He Song had no intention of participating.   Even if Ping’er constantly said that she wanted to see his heroic figure.   But He Song didn’t budge.   Participating in the Outer Disciple Competition had no benefits for He Song; on the contrary, the drawbacks were numerous.   Even if He Song could make it into the top ten, top three, or even take first place.   For He Song, it would only increase the attention others paid to him, expose him to the public, and reveal his secrets even faster.   It was simply a path to self-destruction.   As for the rewards for the top ten, top three, or even first place.   There was no attraction for He Song.   Foundation Establishment Elixirs? He Song didn’t lack any.   High -quality Artifacts? He Song didn’t lack any either.   The identity of a Golden Elixir Master’s disciple? What could be more terrifying than constantly being watched by a Golden Elixir elder?   As an everlasting being, He Song was not supposed to appear before others when his strength was low.   If he took first place in the competition.   A Golden Elixir Master would be right by his side, and every move he made would be exposed to the Golden Elixir Master.   He Song had many secrets, and if they were discovered.   He might not even have a chance to run.   Wasn’t that seeking death?Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates   Therefore.   Regarding this Outer Disciple Competition.   He Song initially had no intention of participating or even going to watch.   However, many outer disciples chose to participate in the Outer Disciple Competition, and only a few did not participate. Although they did not participate, they still went to watch.   In this way, after learning about the movements of other disciples, He Song had to leave and go to watch the Outer Disciple Competition.   In order not to appear eccentric.   In order not to become the most eye-catching person in the crowd.   In order not to be incompatible with other disciples because of not participating in the Outer Disciple Competition or even watching it.   In order not to be remembered by those Foundation Establishment elders and Golden Elixir Masters.   In the end, He Song had no choice but to come to the scene of the Outer Disciple Competition.   He could choose not to participate.   But he had to come and watch.   By doing this, he wasn’t part of the majority that participated in the competition, but he wasn’t a complete anomaly, either.   There were also some outer disciples who didn’t participate in the Outer Disciple Competition but came to watch.   He Song blended in with these people and didn’t attract too much attention.   On the huge square in the Thick Earth Sect’s outer disciple area.   Ten competition stages were neatly arranged.   He Song quickly glanced at the rules of the Outer Disciple Competition.   By the end of the competition, the ten people still standing on the stage would be the top ten of the Outer Disciple Competition.   After the stage competition was over, the ten people would then continue to decide the top three and the first place.   He Song had just arrived here and hadn’t had time to study the rules before looking for a stage to watch.   When he saw a petite figure appear in front of him.   “Junior Brother He, I knew you would come. Come with me quickly, Junior    Sister Ping’er’s match is about to start. Let’s hurry over.”   As the voice sounded, He Song looked up and saw Chu Shuangshuang had already taken a step forward and was leading the way in front of him.   Seeing this, He Song was speechless.   He just came to join in the fun.   Just to avoid appearing too eccentric.   How did it turn into he would definitely come when Chu Shuangshuang said it? He clearly refused Ping’er very decisively when she wanted him to participate before.   However, watching Chu Shuangshuang’s figure gradually move away, He Song thought about it and quickly followed her.   Since he was here anyway.   It didn’t matter who he watched.   Although Ping’er was only at the eighth-tier of Qi Refining, since she dared to participate, she must have had a trump card.   Thinking about this.   He Song quickly followed Chu Shuangshuang and arrived at a competition stage.   Standing side by side with Chu Shuangshuang below the stage, He Song looked up and immediately saw Ping’er’s figure.   At this time, Pinger looked different from the Ping’er He Song knew in his daily life.   Pinger loved to smile and was always warm and gentle with others.   But now, standing on the stage, her face was extremely serious.   She had surrounded herself with Artifact shields, and mana swords swam around her like a dragon.   Opposite Ping’er was also a female cultivator.   He Song didn’t recognize the woman, but as a cultivator, she was beautiful as well.   However, the Cultivation World was full of beauties, and He Song only glanced at her before focusing on Ping’er.   “An eighth-tier Qi Refining fighting against a ninth-tier? Does Ping’er have a trump card?”   As he murmured to himself, He Song was about to find out what Ping’er’s trump card was that could give her the confidence to win against a higher level.   When Chu Shuangshuang, who was standing beside him, suddenly showed a strange look on her face.   “Junior Sister Ping’er usually focuses on cultivating, and I haven’t seen her practice any skills. As for a trump card…l guess she doesn’t have any.”   As if explaining to He Song, and as if thinking that Ping’er was bound to lose, Chu Shuangshuang spoke with an increasingly strange look on her face.   Turning to look at He Song, Chu Shuangshuang saw the astonishment on his face as he looked at her and continued to speak.   “I tried to persuade her, but she insisted on seeing just how powerful our fellow sisters are. Besides, her cultivation is low, so losing wouldn’t be a disgrace.”   “So… ‘   As she looked at the two people on the stage who had already begun to bow to each other, seemingly preparing for the next moment to take action.   Chu Shuangshuang sighed.   She shook her head.   After shrugging her shoulders toward He Song, she didn’t say anything more about the matter.   Hearing Chu Shuangshuang’s words, He Song was at a loss for words.   He initially thought that Ping’er had some trump card up her sleeve, perhaps capable of defeating a stronger opponent despite her weaker cultivation.   Unexpectedly, Ping’er didn’t have any trump cards, and she only wanted to go on the stage to learn from the other sisters.   With her cultivation at the eighth-tier of Qi Refining, losing wasn’t a disgrace, as Chu Shuangshuang said.   At this moment, the majority of disciples on the stage were at the ninth-tier Qi Refining, and some even had reached the Qi Refining great perfection.   Under such circumstances,   It would be challenging for her, an eighth -tier Qi Refining cultivator without any trump cards, to win.   On the stage,   After Ping’er and the female cultivator opposite her exchanged greetings, they quickly started fighting.   On the stage, two mana swords clanged and rang, and under their mutual strikes, surges of spirit power overflowed.   However, standing below the stage, He Song could clearly perceive that Ping’er was running out of strength.    As expected.   After fighting for a few rounds, Ping’er straightforwardly conceded. Since Ping’er had admitted defeat,   The two on the stage exchanged greetings and farewells once more.   Pinger soon left the stage.   She came over to He Song and the others.   As soon as He Song and the others arrived, she had noticed their presence.   Unfortunately, she was busy on the stage at the time and had no time to greet them.   Now that she had conceded, Ping’er naturally came over immediately.   “Brother, Sister, I lost, ” Ping’er said in a low voice, but upon closer inspection, He Song noticed that despite her words, there wasn’t a trace of discouragement on her face.   It seemed that Chu Shuangshuang’s earlier statement that Ping’er only wanted to go on stage to learn from her fellow sisters was accurate.   From Ping’er’s unfazed expression, it was evident that she probably had never thought of winning in the first place.   In this case,   He Song simply nodded his head and didn’t say anything else.   Chu Shuangshuang on the side also didn’t say anything to comfort Ping’er, only nodding her head like He Song, before leading the two of them away from this stage.   The three of them only stopped after arriving underneath a new stage, and then began to chat casually.   He Song was unwilling to participate in the Outer Disciple Competition.   Chu Shuangshuang already had a Foundation Establishment Elixir and didn’t need to participate in the Outer Disciple Competition.   Since Ping’er had already participated, she naturally didn’t think about going on stage again.   Thus,   When the three gathered together, commenting on the fighting disciples on the stages became a good way to pass the time.   He Song had quite an extensive network among the outer disciples.   While chatting casually with the two beside him, other outer disciples that he knew would occasionally come to greet him.   He Song responded to each of them without appearing unsociable,   Just like an ordinary outer disciple, not drawing any attention.   The traditional Thick Earth Sect’s Outer Disciple Competition was held once every thirty years.   The once-in-thirty-years competition was quite a grand event, and its rewards were even more abundant.   At that time, Foundation Establishment elders from within the sect would come to seek disciples.   Unlike this Outer Disciple Competition, which was quite modest with only ten stages.   This Outer Disciple Competition was not a tradition of the Thick Earth Sect but the Outer Disciple Competition held by Master Fa Xuan in order to compensate the outer disciples.   Its purpose   Was actually to make it easier for the outer disciples to advance to Foundation Establishment and to have more Foundation Establishment Masters born within the sect.   That’s why ten Foundation Establishment Elixirs were awarded this time.   In the outside world, many outer disciples already have Foundation Establishment elders as their masters, and their Foundation Establishment Elixirs were basically taken care of by their masters.   Just like Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang, the Foundation Establishment Elixirs for the two of them were taken care of by Master Qingyue, and they didn’t need to worry about it themselves.   This time, the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect went to war, requiring all disciples to return to the sect’s headquarters.   At the same time, their masters would also be requisitioned by the sect to fight against the Seven Star Sect.   In that case, some disciples who had reached the Qi Refining great perfection would be left without Foundation Establishment Elixirs for their breakthrough.   Also, their masters might not have time to find Foundation Establishment Elixirs for them anymore.   Under such circumstances,   Holding an impromptu Outer Disciple Competition and issuing Foundation Establishment Elixirs to outer disciples who had reached Qi Refining great perfection but couldn’t break through due to a lack of elixirs became an excellent solution.   Disciples at the Qi Refining great perfection were, of course, stronger than regular ninth-tier Qi Refining disciples.   Their chances of getting higher rankings were naturally greater.   As for other rewards, such as high-quality Artifacts and becoming a disciple of the Sect Leader,   They were all secondary.   If they already had a master, even if they won first place, they might not be able to enjoy the status as a disciple of the Sect Leader.   The hierarchy of respect for masters was quite strict in the Cultivation World..

Chapter 170 - 170: 170: Two Years Later Translator: 549690339   It could be said that the reward for taking first place in the Outer Disciple Competition was extremely tempting in the eyes of some outer disciples who had no master.   However, in the eyes of some other people, it was not even comparable to the top three rewards.   He Song and his companions did not leave the venue of the Outer Disciple Competition, thus they got a very clear view of the wins and losses on the ten stages.   There were no surprises for He Song.   When no one else went up to challenge, the ten people left standing on the stages were almost all at the level of Qi Refining great perfection.   Outer Sect disciples who had not reached the Qi Refining Great Perfection could not defeat them.   Disciples who had reached the Qi Refining Great Perfection but possessed Foundation Establishment Elixirs would not participate.   Therefore, the people who could remain on the stages were mostly those who were at Qi Refining Great Perfection and did not have Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   Just like Chu Shuangshuang next to He Song.   She was at the Qi Refining great perfection stage but did not want to compete for the top ten spots on the stages with others because she already had a Foundation Establishment Elixir.   It wasn’t that she didn’t care about the improved success rate of Foundation Establishment with an extra Elixir.   Instead, there was an unspoken rule in this Outer Disciple Competition.   The ten Foundation Establishment Elixirs were reserved for those Outer Sect Disciples who were about to reach Foundation Establishment but did not have Elixirs.   Disciples like her who had Foundation Establishment Elixirs basically understood this rule.   It was Chu Shuangshuang who told He Song about this, and only then did he realize that there were such secrets.   At the same time, after knowing that there was an unspoken rule, He Song was also glad that he didn’t go on the stage.   If he really stood on the stage and grabbed a spot, he would have likely become a target and be seen as someone who broke the rules.   After all, He Song currently had two Foundation Establishment Elixirs on the surface.   These two Foundation Establishment Elixirs were passed down from the Sect   Leader.   They fell into He Song’s hands through Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   This was not difficult to find out.   Therefore, if He Song still grabbed a spot while having the two Foundation Establishment Elixirs, he would immediately be seen as a greedy person.   At that time, it would be hard not to be remembered by others.   Since he knew there was an unwritten rule in the Outer Disciple Competition, He Song’s original subtle desire to compete also completely dissipated.   This sudden Outer Disciple Competition was in fact just Master Fa Xuan’s way of winning people’s hearts in secret.   If one or two of the top ten disciples in this competition were able to successfully reach Foundation Establishment, they would probably owe Master Fa Xuan a favor.   Under such circumstances, He Song gained a deeper understanding of Master Fa Xuan through his actions.   “Although it’s simple and crude, it’s a good way to win people’s hearts.”   “But it doesn’t matter, after all, he is a Golden Elixir Master.”   He Song shook his head, his gaze thoughtful as he swept over the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect, and stopped dwelling on these thoughts.   Since he already knew that there was more to this Outer Disciple Competition, He Song had no expectations for the results.   Who would take first place.   Who would take second place.   Who would be in the top ten.    In fact, it didn’t make a difference for He Song.   Anyway, he was now fully prepared and just waiting to reach Qi Refining great perfection before attempting Foundation Establishment.   Now, He Song’s main task was to seclude himself in cultivation and quickly reach Qi Refining great perfection.   Therefore, after chatting with Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang until the end of the competition, He Song didn’t even glance at the first place winner; he turned around and went back to the living quarters with the other disciples.   The Outer Disciple Competition ended.   He Song quickly immersed himself in cultivation.   In the blink of an eye, two years had passed. During these two years,   He Song spent his days practicing cultivation   As well as studying the Smoke Array and the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill.   Finally,   One day,   He Song engraved all the intricate array patterns required for the Smoke Array on the Array Disk and Array Banners.   When the mysterious array patterns were densely distributed on the Array Banners in his hand, making the entire banner seem extremely mysterious, a smile appeared on He Song’s face.   “The Smoke Array is complete!”   Feeling delighted in his heart, He Song casually put the Array Banner into his storage bag.   There were already two sets of Array Skills in He Song’s storage bag.   One was the Spirit-Gathering Array, which He Song had made seven years ago and had been kept in the storage bag ever since.   The other was the Smoke Array, which He Song had finally succeeded in making now.   Originally, He Song had thought about leaving the Thick Earth Sect and opening a cave mansion in the outside world after creating the Spirit-Gathering Array.   From then on, he would no longer have to worry about a Golden Elixir Master discovering his secrets in the Thick Earth Sect.   Unfortunately, at that time, He Song hadn’t learned the Smoke Array yet. If he had rashly opened up a cave mansion outside, once discovered by others, he would likely be in a situation of certain death.   Because of this, he had been delaying until now.   However, now that He Song had truly created a set of Smoke Arrays, his idea of leaving the sect and opening a cave mansion immediately resurfaced.   “If I leave the sect and build a cave mansion, set up a small Spirit-Gathering Array, my cultivation speed will be even faster.”   “Moreover, within the small Spirit-Gathering Array, even if I break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, it wouldn’t cause any commotion. With the concealment of the Smoke Array, not even a Golden Elixir Master’s divine sense could detect the existence of the cave mansion.”   “In this case, it is indeed the best time to leave the sect and establish a cave mansion. ”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎   With various ideas flashing through his mind, He Song made up his mind after a brief contemplation and then stood up from his meditation chamber, putting all his belongings into the storage bag.   He Song was definitely moving out of the small courtyard where the outer disciples of the Thick Earth Sect lived.   Would he return here again in the future?   He Song was not too sure about that either.   However, taking away all his belongings would not hinder him from returning in the future.   Of course, with the storage bag available, it was only natural to take all these belongings to his new cave mansion on a whim.   Since he was leaving the sect in order to open a cave mansion, it wasn’t like He Song would never return after opening up his cave mansion.   Therefore, He Song did not say goodbye to Wei Fan, Ping’er, and the others.   Instead, after packing his things, he came to the periphery of the Thick Earth Sect alone.   Seeing that no one was around, He Song’s figure sunk into the ground using the Earth Tunneling Skill and quickly headed towards the outside of the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   Soon enough,    He Song’s figure appeared dozens of miles away from the Thick Earth Sect.   After floating up to the surface and surveying the surroundings, He Song confirmed his current location but didn’t stay, instead using the Earth   Tunneling away towards the east of the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   In that direction was the Green Wall Immortal City.   However, he wasn’t trying to go to Green Wall Immortal City. The reason was that a few years ago, He Song had come across a beautiful place with clear mountains and rivers, birdsong and fragrant flowers while searching for a suitable place to establish spirit fields.   Although the spirit Qi in that area was scarce, as long as He Song deployed a small Spirit-Gathering Array, the concentration of spirit Qi would naturally increase.   Moreover, that place was several hundred miles to the east of the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   Such a distance would take He Song several hours to travel at his current speed.   Presumably, even if the Thick Earth Sect experienced any changes or was attacked by a Golden Elixir Master, it would not affect the location of He Song’s cave mansion.   As such, it was naturally a very safe place to be.   Living there, He Song could return to the Thick Earth Sect in just a few hours it was not exactly near but still relatively convenient.   Under such circumstances, it was only natural for He Song to choose that place as the location of his cave mansion.   After traveling underground for several hours,   He Song’s figure finally appeared beside a river.   Gazing into the distance, He Song’s eyes flashed with satisfaction.   This place was truly a good location.   The continuous mountains in the distance and the hazy mist on the river, along with the occasional sounds of insects, birds, and fish leaping in the river, all gave He Song a wonderful feeling of being integrated with heaven and earth.   With a flash in his eyes,   only after detecting that there were no spirit power fluctuations around him, He Song waved his hand, and an Array Disk and six Array Banners appeared before him.   One Array Disk and six Array Banners were the items needed to set up the Smoke Array.   He Song chose a low hill by the river for his cave mansion.   The view from here was excellent, and anyone passing by would be immediately noticed by He Song.   Also, with the steep hill nearby, even if the cave mansion was discovered, He Song could easily escape through Earth Tunneling without worrying about being trapped on a mountain peak.   Thus, He Song formed hand gestures, and the Array Disk in his hand quickly floated up, transforming into a ray of light and falling into the small mountain not far away.   When the Array Disk was in position,   He Song changed his hand gestures, and the Array Banners shot out from his hand one by one, flying towards the small mountain not far away.   When they reached the top of the small mountain, the Array Banners fell into the mountain under He Song’s control, forming a mysterious array within the mountain.   Having done all this, He Song casually scattered five hundred spirit stones, and the small mountain instantly flashed before returning to its normal state.   Only faint wisps of smoke, invisible to the naked eye and undetectable by divine sense, drifted with the wind around the small mountain.   When ordinary cultivators perceived it, they would subconsciously stay away from this place.   Seeing this, He Song’s face flashed a faint expression of joy, and he immediately flied towards the small mountain.   The Array Skills described in Array Tao Primary Introduction consume a tremendous amount of spirit stones.   Maintaining an array for just one year requires five hundred spirit stones.   This is the case for the small Spirit-Gathering Array and for the Smoke Array.   However, fortunately, both the small Spirit-Gathering Array and the Smoke Array could store more spirit stones at once, so He Song didn’t have to replenish spirit stones every year.   If he put enough spirit stones in at once for the Array to run for decades, the Array would naturally operate for decades.   Unless it were offensive or defensive arrays.   For these two types of arrays, if someone tries to break through, the consumption of spirit stones would be extremely terrifying. Perhaps even thousands of spirit stones might not last long.   However, as He Song hadn’t learned these types of arrays right now, he didn’t need to worry about running out of spirit stones.   The moment He Song stepped into the range of the small mountain, his figure suddenly disappeared..

Chapter 171 - 171: 171: Old Friend Has Passed Away Translator: 549690339   He had already entered the Smoke Array.   From the outside world’s perspective, he seemed to have disappeared into thin air.   As the one who set up the array, He Song naturally wouldn’t be affected by the Smoke Array.   Therefore, after stepping into the Smoke Array, he immediately controlled the Array Disk, expanding its range to cover much more than just the small hill it first encompassed.   Only after integrating a small part of the nearby river into the Smoke Array did He Song stop manipulating it.   At this moment, the Smoke Array completely enveloped the small hill where He Song was, as well as a large area around it, extending even to the nearby river.   He Song’s gaze swept across the area covered by the Smoke Array, calculating tor a moment betore nodding ms nead.   “The Smoke Array covers dozens of acres. If it weren’t for the river on one side and the mountain slope on the other, it could be even larger.”   “I’ll construct the cave mansion on the top of the hill, using the other areas to plant spirit rice and medicinal herbs.”   “In this way, not only will I make use of the spirit Qi gathered by the small Spirit-Gathering Array, but I also won’t waste the area covered by the Smoke Array.”   “The Smoke Array is far stronger than the Illusion Array. Even if a cultivator was to fly by above it, their divine sense would be unable to detect anything.”   “It seems I’ll have to purchase some precious spirit medicine seeds and transform the entire surrounding area into spirit fields.”   After secretly planning everything in his mind, He Song concentrated his thoughts and brought out another Array Disk and five Array Banners, which were required for the small Spirit-Gathering Array.   Ever since He Song had created the small Spirit-Gathering Array’s Formation Disk and Array Banners seven years ago, this was only the second time he had taken them out.   The first time was shortly after he had made the Spirit-Gathering Array, when he had secretly ventured out of the sect to test it.   Since then, He Song had never taken out the Spirit-Gathering Array’s Formation Disc and Array Banners within the Thick Earth Sect or anywhere else.   Until today.   He Song intended to open a cave mansion here.   Of course, a Spirit-Gathering Array that could gather the spirit Qi in the surroundings was necessary to set up inside the cave mansion.   After arranging the Smoke Array and completely hiding the area he was in, He Song naturally began to open his cave mansion.   With a simple motion of his finger, a divine light shot out from He Song’s hand, directly penetrating into the mountain under his feet.   Seeing that the Spirit-Gathering Array’s Formation Disk had been set, He Song changed his hand seals, and the five Array Banners rose into the air, quickly fluttering around.   Following this, He Song’s gaze became solemn, and with a downward press of his finger, the five Array Banners floating in mid-air transformed into streams of light, plunging into the mountain.   From then on, the small Spirit-Gathering Array was laid out.   Feeling the spirit Qi density in the area slowly increasing, He Song nodded slightly, a hint of satisfaction flashing in his eyes.   With the Spirit-Gathering Array gathering spirit Qi, the aura in this area would soon become rich.   At that time, his cultivation speed here would definitely be faster than within the Thick Earth Sect.   One must know that He Song would now have a small Spirit-Gathering Array all to himself.   Although there were still several dozen acres of spirit fields that needed nourishment, He Song could also set up another small Spirit-Gathering Array within his cave mansion to supply the spirit fields with Qi.   Perhaps, with the supply of spirit Qi from a small Spirit-Gathering Array, the spirit rice in these fields would become more plentiful, or the medicinal properties of the spirit medicine would improve.   In that case, once He Song started selling spirit medicine or spirit rice, the profits would naturally be much higher.    Now that the small Spirit-Gathering Array had been set up and the area was completely concealed by the Smoke Array, He Song immediately used Object Controlling Skills to create a cave mansion on the small hill beneath his feet.   Although dubbed a cave mansion, it looked more like a mountain cave.   However, due to the cover provided by the mountain and the relatively small entrance, the cave mansion He Song created appeared to be quite concealed.   Unless one was carefully scanning with divine sense or observing closely, most people would likely overlook it unconsciously.   Although it was already hidden within the Smoke Array, He Song’s cautious nature demanded that the cave mansion he constructed also possess a certain degree of concealment.   After opening up the cave mansion, He Song divided it into several areas.   One quiet room for seclusive cultivation, one hall for daily relaxation or entertaining guests, one place for daily skill practice, one place for studying spirit amulets, and one tea room for daily tea drinking.   As for the kitchen and other necessary facilities, He Song also carved them out separately.   One downside of making one’s own cave mansion was that he would have to cook his own spirit rice every day. No one would deliver food during seclusive cultivation, leaving him only the option to consume Inedia Elixir.   Inedia Elixir could only maintain daily consumption, while spirit rice could accelerate cultivation.   Therefore, most cultivators consumed spirit rice daily, only relying on Inedia Elixir to sustain their bodies’ daily needs during seclusive cultivation or other scenarios where spirit rice couldn’t be consumed.   However, He Song didn’t care too much about these things.   Compared to these trifling matters, constantly worrying about his secrets being exposed within the Thick Earth Sect was truly unbearable.   Rather than enduring that anxiety, it was better to move out of the sect and construct a new cave mansion that brought peace of mind.   “The cave mansion has been opened up, now I need to purchase some spirit medicine seeds.”   “Also, the skill of amulet making needs to be obtained. If too much time passes, someone might misunderstand and think I have a talent for array tao, which would be troublesome.”   “I wonder if that Senior Brother Song Zhen from back then is still around. He did say that if I couldn’t learn, I could exchange it for one of the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth for free.” (From Chapter 129)   After the completion of the cave mansion.   After pondering for a moment, He Song quickly stepped out of the Smoke Array and headed towards the distance.   He needed to go to a nearby Immortal Pavilion to buy some spirit medicine seeds, and then return to the Book Collection Pavilion of the Thick Earth Sect to find a senior brother named Song Zhen and exchange the Amulet Tao Introductory Insights from him.   In this way, He Song’s future path in Amulet Tao would naturally have a new goal.   Soon.   He Song arrived at the nearest Immortal Pavilion from his newly opened cave mansion.   Colorful Cloud Immortal Pavilion.   This place had a unique terrain, with colorful clouds constantly appearing in the sky.   Thus, it was named the Colorful Cloud Immortal Pavilion.   He Song had never been here before. This time, he entered the pavilion to buy spirit medicine seeds while wearing a black robe and changing his appearance and body shape.   After finding the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion in the Colorful Cloud Immortal Pavilion and buying some popular spirit grass seeds that didn’t require a long time to grow, He Song turned and left, heading towards the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   A few hours later.   Upon returning to the Thick Earth Sect, He Song didn’t go back to his original residence but went straight to the Book Collection Pavilion of the Thick Earth Sect.   However, just as he stepped into the Book Collection Pavilion, a figure quickly appeared beside him.   “I am Yang Yan, and I greet this Senior Brother. Is there anything I can help you with?”   As the figure appeared, the man’s voice also reached He Song’s ears. Upon hearing this, He Song looked towards the source of the sound.   A young man appeared before his eyes.    Looking at the young man, he still seemed to have a trace of immaturity in his eyes, indicating that he must have lived in a secluded place for a long time.   At this moment, the young man was standing by He Song’s side, looking at He Song with a smile on his face.   Seeing this, He Song shook his head and didn’t answer his question. Instead, he asked,Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m   “I am He Song, and I greet Junior Brother Yang. How long have you been here, Junior Brother Yang? Have you ever seen a Senior Brother named Song Zhen here?”   He Song hadn’t seen Song Zhen at first glance and already had some speculations in his heart.   Back when he had just joined the Thick Earth Sect, Song Zhen was already a Qi Refining great perfection cultivator.   Now, more than a decade had passed.   His own cultivation had broken through from the seventh- tier of Qi Refining back then to the present ninth-tier of Qi Refining.   Presumably, Song Zhen’s cultivation wouldn’t have remained stagnant either.   If Song Zhen hadn’t successfully established his foundation, he must have been sent out of the mountain gate by now.   If Song Zhen had already achieved Foundation Establishment… he should have been sent to the war between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect, right?   The war between the Seven Star Sect and the Thick Earth Sect.   It had been going on for two years.   In these two years, He Song’s life hadn’t changed much.   But occasionally, news from the front lines would give him some understanding of the war between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect.   Although the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect had comparable numbers of Foundation Establishment cultivators, the Thick Earth Sect had a slightly greater number, but there was no overwhelming advantage.   Therefore, in order to avoid massive casualties among the Foundation   Establishment masters,   Both sides maintained a certain degree of restraint in the war over the past two years, and almost all of those participating were Qi Refining stage cultivators.   Foundation Establishment experts rarely entered the battlefield.   In such a situation, allocating more Foundation Establishment experts from other places to join the battlefield might give them a numerical advantage.   This was also the reason He Song was certain that if Song Zhen had achieved Foundation Establishment, he would definitely be sent to the frontline.   However, all of this was speculation now.   To find out whether Song Zhen had achieved Foundation Establishment or not, and where he had been sent,   He could only ask Yang Yan, who was standing in front of him. “Senior Brother Song Zhen?”   “Ten years ago, Senior Brother Song Zhen failed his attempt to achieve Foundation Establishment. After recovering from his injuries, he was assigned to the Mountain Immortal City to handle affairs.”   “Senior Brother He, you are one step too late.”   “Three months ago, Senior Brother Song Zhen was ambushed outside the Mountain Immortal City and lost his life…”   Upon He Song’s inquiry, a trace of sadness flashed in Yang Yan’s eyes as he slowly informed He Song of what he knew.   Outer disciples of the Thick Earth Sect, if they failed to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm by the age of sixty, they would be sent to the Immortal City.   It was normal for Song Zhen to be sent to the Mountain Immortal City after failing to achieve Foundation Establishment.   He Song wasn’t surprised when he heard the first part of Yang Yan’s description.   But.   When he heard that Song Zhen had died outside the Mountain Immortal City three months ago, a trace of regret couldn’t help but flash in his eyes.   Song Zhen.   The very same Senior Brother Song Zhen who had warmly helped him choose skills when they first met.   In He Song’s heart, he still had some impression of him..

Chapter 172 - 172: 172: Secret Technique Translator: 549690339   At the beginning, after choosing Array Tao Primary Introduction, Song Zhen had specially reminded him that if he couldn’t learn it, he could come back and exchange it for free.   Unfortunately… when He Song came back now, Song Zhen could no longer be found in the Book Collection Pavilion.   Letting out a sigh, He Song swept his gaze over the familiar Book Collection Pavilion, suddenly feeling dispirited.   The Book Collection Pavilion in front of him even seemed to become a bit dimmer.   After a brief moment of silence.   He Song spoke again.   “Mr. Yang, please restrain your grief. I came to look for Brother Song Zhen, but there is no important matter. It’s just that I once heard him mention that if I couldn’t learn Array Tao Primary Introduction, I could come here to exchange it for another free Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.”   “I wonder if Mr. Yang could help me exchange it for Amulet Tao Introductory Insights?”   With that, He Song took out the records of his previous study of the Array Tao Primary Introduction and other skills at the Book Collection Pavilion, and handed it to Yang Yan in front of him.   Yang Yan looked and didn’t speak; he just nodded his head at He Song.   Then he turned around and left to find Amulet Tao Introductory Insights for He Song.   Seeing that Yang Yan seemed unenthusiastic, He Song thought about it and started wandering around the Book Collection Pavilion.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com   There were many books in the Book Collection Pavilion.   Most of them were recorded on jade slips, and there were paper introductions beside the jade slips.   He Song casually flipped through these introductions, his gaze also swept over one jade slip after another.   All of this.   To learn, one needs contribution points.   Each jade slip costs about two to five contribution points.   These jade slips only record Qi refining stage skills, and if Foundation Establishment Realm skills are involved, the price is likely to be higher.   However.   While He Song was strolling around the Book Collection Pavilion.   As he walked, his gaze swept over each jade slip.   When he walked to a jade slip and saw the five big characters on the paper introduction book, those five characters quickly attracted He Song’s attention.   “Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill!”   “Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill?”   “I should have thought of it earlier. There is Mountain Wind Riding Skill and   Mountain Pressing Sword Riding Skill, so why wouldn’t there be Mountain   Merging Earth Tunneling Skill?”   “Maybe after Foundation Establishment, there will be a Foundation   Establishment edition of Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill?”   Looking at the suddenly appearing Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill, He Song’s face flashed a trace of astonishment, but quickly came to understand.   However, understanding aside.   Looking at the jade slip in front of him that recorded the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill, He Song’s eyes gradually filled with passion.   Ordinary Earth Tunneling Skills.   It would allow him to tunnel ten meters underground and, coupled with Breath Concealment Formulas, greatly increase the stealthiness of his departure from the sect.   So, what about Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill?   This is a secret skill!   Moreover, it is a secret skill of the Thick Earth Sect, a sect that specializes in earth attribute skills!   If he learned it, wouldn’t his stealthiness when using the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill to leave the sect increase exponentially in the future?    Thinking of this, He Song hurriedly took down the jade slip in front of him and held it in his hand.   At the same time, he couldn’t help but glance at the other jade slips around him.   He wanted to see if there were any other secret skills similar to the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill.   Secret skills like the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill were extremely important to He Song.   However.   After searching for a while, He Song didn’t find any other secret skills, and in the end, he could only return unhappily to his original spot and wait for Yang Yan’s return.   It didn’t take long for He Song to wait.   Shortly after He Song returned to his original spot, Yang Yan quickly brought back Amulet Tao Introductory Insights’ jade slip for He Song.   The jade slip for Amulet Tao Introductory Insights didn’t require He Song to spend contribution points and was exchanged for free.   However, the jade slip for the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill cost He   Song a full three contribution points to purchase.   Four hundred and fifty spirit stones.   A bit expensive.   But it’s worth it!   The first one was, of course, Amulet Tao Introductory Insights.   Placing the jade slip on his forehead, He Song’s mind was immediately branded with all kinds of information about Amulet Tao Introductory Insights.   After receiving all the knowledge about Amulet Tao Introductory Insights, He Song picked up the jade slip containing the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill.   He affixed it to his forehead as well.   Immediately, all kinds of cultivation methods and tricks related to Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill poured into He Song’s mind.   He only needed to recall it casually, and he could remember everything about the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill, making it impossible to forget.   After all this was done.   He Song left the quiet room and returned the jade slips.   Then, he went alone to the periphery of the Thick Earth Sect and used the Earth Tunneling Skill to go to his newly opened cave mansion.   Since he already had his cave mansion.   Naturally, He Song would not stay at the entrance of the Thick Earth Sect as he did before.   Although his cave mansion was not as safe as the Thick Earth Sect with the protection of the Golden Elixir Master.   But with the protection of the Smoke Array, He Song’s newly opened cave mansion would be safer than ordinary Immortal Mansions or even the prestigious ones.   Once He Song learns an offensive or defensive Array Skill in the future, he can arrange these skills within his newly excavated cave mansion.   At that time, the safety of He Song’s cave mansion will naturally greatly increase.   A few hours later.   He Song returned to his newly excavated cave mansion.   As the surrounding area of the cave mansion had not yet been turned into fields and still appeared as a wasteland, He Song quickly began to transform the land around his cave mansion after returning.   The land that could be turned into fields was turned into fields, waiting for the small Spirit-Gathering Array to gather spirit Qi and transform these fields into spirit fields.   For those that couldn’t be turned into fields, He Song chose some places and transformed them into Medicine Gardens, waiting for the spirit Qi to become abundant before planting spirit medicine seeds.   The spirit medicine seeds he had bought from Colorful Cloud Immortal Mansion were still lying quietly in his storage bag at this moment.   After doing all these things, He Song introduced water from the river beside his cave mansion and had it flow within the range of the Smoke Array.   After tidying up the surroundings of the cave mansion according to his own wishes,   He Song stood at the entrance of the cave mansion.   His gaze swept around, and a satisfied expression appeared on his face.   His cave mansion was located halfway up a small hill.   Looking out from the entrance of the cave mansion, the most magnificent scenery of this place could be seen at a glance.    Layers of fields were situated at the foot of the hills, adjoining the river.   Patches of medicine gardens, still covered in lush green grass, were spread throughout the hills, looking like carefully adorned emeralds that dazzled the   eyes.   The place was situated near mountains and rivers, with beautiful scenery and a variety of wild animals. It wouldn’t seem too secluded.   Gazing at the scene before him, He Song took a deep breath and felt his mood lighten considerably.   “This place is wonderful. In the future, when I retreat for cultivation, I can do so right here.”   “If I need to do other things, I can leave the cave mansion and go to the Thick Earth Sect or other places.”   “In this way, I don’t need to worry about my secret being discovered. It’s much better than being in the Thick Earth Sect.”   “It’s just… traveling is a bit inconvenient, but it’s bearable.”   After taking another look at the range covered by the Smoke Array, He Song turned around and entered the cave mansion.   The entrance of the cave mansion also quietly closed at this moment.   From within the Smoke Array, He Song’s cave mansion seemed to have disappeared, leaving no traces at all.   However, if one were to look at the small hill where He Song was from outside the Smoke Array,   it would seem as if the small hill and the surrounding land had no difference compared to the rest of the area.   The spirit fields and medicine gardens that He Song had created were all hidden within the illusions of the Smoke Array, making it difficult to distinguish the truth.   Moreover, this place was already remote, and hardly anyone, whether cultivators or ordinary people, would come here.   Under such circumstances, it would be quite difficult for He Song’s cave mansion to be discovered.   This wasn’t an Immortal Pavilion or Immortal City open to the public.   No one would be deliberately searching for this place.   Naturally, all he needed to do was avoid other cultivators’ sight and divine sense to ensure the safety of his cave mansion.   Once He Song has learned defensive and offensive Array Skills in the future, the security of this place will become even higher.   Inside the cave mansion.   He Song arrived in the meditation room.   Once he sat down cross-legged, all sorts of information about the “Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill” suddenly filled his mind.   “The Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill is significantly faster and can tunnel deeper than the ordinary Earth Tunneling Skill.”   “Furthermore, one can even launch attacks from beneath the ground, potentially catching unprepared cultivators by surprise and killing them.”   “However, the Earthshaking Skill can still pose a great threat to the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill.”   “As a result, few outer disciples within the Thick Earth Sect are willing to practice this skill.”   “It is a skill with great advantages but also extremely obvious drawbacks.”   As the introduction of the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill flashed through his mind, He Song agreed quite a bit with these opinions.   The Earthshaking Skill truly countered the Earth Tunneling Skill to an extreme degree.   It wasn’t much of a problem if they hadn’t encountered a cultivator who had learned the Earthshaking Skill, but if they did,   they might be shaken out from the ground and even killed instantly after using the Earth Tunneling Skill.   Such an obvious drawback could not be entirely avoided even by the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill.   The Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill only allowed for deeper and more concealed tunneling, as well as launching sneak attacks from beneath the ground.   However, if it encountered the Earthshaking Skill cast by a cultivator of the same level, the impact range of the Earthshaking Skill would be incredibly huge,   and the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill would also be greatly affected.   Therefore, for sect disciples with many other skills available to learn, it was not worthwhile to practice an Earth Tunneling Skill with such noticeable drawbacks.   There were countless skills within the Thick Earth Sect.   They could learn whatever they wanted, such as Sword Riding Skill, Wind Riding Skill, or other skills, none of which would have particularly obvious drawbacks.   There was no need to constantly fixate on the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill, which had such significant drawbacks.   Only He Song, out of caution, would be so persistent in learning the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill.   “Now that the cave mansion is complete, the next step is to steadily improve my cultivation, and practice the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill and the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill.”   “I hope that by the time I leave seclusion, my cultivation has reached Qi Refining great perfection.”   As the cultivation method for the Mountain Merging Earth Tunneling Skill flashed through his mind, He Song began to practice the skill according to the method while thinking about this..

Chapter 173 - 173: 173: 3 Years Later Translator: 549690339   However, even though He Song thought this way in his heart, he knew that it was just his own wishful thinking.   Secluding himself and achieving Qi Refining great perfection all at once.   It seems very beautiful.   But he would miss many things.   For example…   Three years later.   He Song had already cultivated the Mountain Escaping Skill to the point where he could use it freely and without losing its power.   At the same time, during these three years, the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill was finally understood by He Song and he could use it at any time to place all the spirit power hidden in his body into the Elixir Field.   In addition to practicing, He Song did not forget his great plan for farming.   The new spirit field outside his cave mansion had been completely turned into a spirit field, and he even harvested one crop, yielding tens of thousands of pounds of spirit rice.   Besides that, He Song had also planted spirit medicines in the medicinal gardens that he had opened up.   However, the time required for spirit medicines to grow was too long, and they still had not matured up to now.   Seeing this, He Song could only wait patiently for the spirit medicines to mature.   After all, he didn’t have a small jade bottle, and it was impossible to instantly mature the newly planted spirit medicines to the level of hundreds or thousands of years.   Fortunately, he had a long life ahead of him.   He didn’t have to compete against time like other cultivators.   The cave mansion was well-managed by He Song.   In fact, he even remembered the one hundred spirit fields he had opened up elsewhere.   In these three years, He Song harvested three spirit fields and sold two batches of spirit rice, making a profit of more than thirty thousand spirit stones.   He Song saved up these thirty thousand spirit stones, apart from the necessary expenditures.   By now, He Song already possessed six Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   At least in his first attempt at Foundation Establishment, he would not need to exchange for additional Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   Only after his first attempt of Foundation Establishment failed would He Song need to go back to the Thick Earth Sect to exchange for the second Foundation Establishment attempt.   Therefore, He Song, who had not yet attempted Foundation Establishment for the first time, did not intend to use the spirit stones on his body to exchange for Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   Save up the spirit stones.   If his first Foundation Establishment attempt was successful, the saved spirit stones could be used as his startup capital during the Foundation Establishment Stage.   At that time, high-quality artifacts and Foundation Establishment skills would all require spirit stones.   He Song saved up the spirit stones also intending to plan for the future.   Of course, if he failed in his first attempt at Foundation Establishment, the saved spirit stones could be used to purchase additional Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   He now possessed more than one hundred acres of spirit field.   With so many spirit fields, he could earn more than ten thousand spirit stones per year.   Almost one Foundation Establishment Elixir per year.   Such a terrifying speed of earning spirit stones made He Song secretly click his tongue.   He merely mastered some introductory Array Skills, and he could already earn so many spirit stones.   How about those sects, those aristocratic families…   A thought suddenly struck He Song.   He was different from those sects and aristocratic families.   His earnings, aside from the cost of running the array, all belonged to himself.   For the people from those sects and aristocratic families, they needed to calculate the expenses for inviting Array Path Masters, the cost of stationing people in the spirit fields, the cost of running the array annually, and the wages for the spiritual plant farmers to manage the spirit fields.   With so many costs calculated, the spirit stones they could earn would definitely be much less than him.   Moreover, the spirit stones they earned would most likely be used to sustain the sect or aristocratic family.   Maybe, most of the income would have to be handed over to the Upper Sect as protection money.    Thus, the more they earned, the more they spent.   Those sects and aristocratic families might not be as free and easy as he is.   After all, he was the kind of person who had control over the means of production and could support his whole family by himself.   Such a person could live freely wherever he went, right?   With this thought in mind, He Song’s mind began to wander. But soon he was awakened by the light appearing at his side.   Inside the meditation room.   He Song, who had been cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes.   His gaze swept around before letting out a sigh of relief.   “A Sound Transmission Amulet? Has the day for Wei to leave arrived?”   Three years ago, before He Song went into seclusion, he had thought about Wei Fan leaving the Thick Earth Sect in three years and being sent to the front lines of the Mountain Immortal City.   Now, three years have passed, and when He Song saw the glowing Sound Transmission Amulet, he naturally understood who was looking for him.   He picked up the Sound Transmission Amulet.   Opened it.   Took out a thin piece of paper from it.   He Song’s eyes scanned it, and immediately a knowing look appeared in his eyes.   “Fellow Daoist He, I have been in the Foundation Establishment Stage for ten years, and now that I have fully mastered the power of Foundation Establishment, it is time for us to part.”   “Last night, the Sect Leader sent a message to me, assigning me to the Mountain Immortal City, stationed there with Lao Meng.”   “Today, I came to find Fellow Daoist but found that the place where you reside is empty. Has something happened?”   “If nothing has happened, I hope Fellow Daoist will return to Thick Earth Sect as soon as possible. I would like to say goodbye in person.”   “Wei Fan.”   He Song sighed as he put away the thin paper in his storage bag.   He had known this day would come a long time ago.   Even on the day Meng Guan left the sect, he had thought about the arrival of this day.   But…   When Wei Fan was truly sent to the front line of Mountain Immortal City by the Sect Leader, He Song couldn’t help but feel a little emotional.   During these three years, although He Song spent most of the time in the cave mansion, due to his extensive connections, he was not isolated from the news.   Three years had passed.   The war between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect had gradually escalated.   At first, it was just Qi Refining cultivators fighting against each other.   It evolved later to Foundation Establishment Stage Masters joining the fight. By now, several Foundation Establishment Stage Masters from both sides had died.   He Song didn’t recognize any of the Foundation Establishment Stage Masters who died on the Thick Earth Sect’s side.   However, not being in the Thick Earth Sect, He Song could clearly sense the increasingly oppressive atmosphere within the sect.   Under the circumstance where their own side had an advantage in terms of higher-level fighters,   Golden Elixir Masters were not participating in the battles.   Instead, they let their Foundation Establishment Stage Masters and Qi Refining disciples compete against each other. This made He Song totally puzzled.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m   But eventually,   He wasn’t a Golden Elixir Master, so although he was curious, he didn’t know any better.   His only conclusion was that the two Golden Elixir Masters within the Thick Earth Sect had other considerations in mind.   However, no matter how hard he tried, He Song couldn’t understand their rationale.   Now that Wei Fan was being sent to Mountain Immortal City, He Song felt a little depressed.   Meng Guan had been living on the edge even during his Qi Refining stage.   Hence, his title Master Duan Hun was achieved during his Qi Refining stage with his Soul-Broken Sword.   One could say that Meng Guan had extremely rich combat experience.   After reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, he lived quite carefree in Mountain Immortal City.    But Wei Fan was different from Meng Guan.   From the beginning, Wei Fan had been in safe environments.   Whether it was at the Thick Earth Mansion, Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, Green Wall Immortal City, or later when he arrived at the Thick Earth Sect,   All these areas were extremely safe.   The number of fights that Wei Fan had experienced in his life were likely very few.   Under such circumstances, just ten years after breaking through Foundation Establishment, he was sent to defend the Mountain Immortal City.   It was not difficult to imagine how dangerous Wei Fan’s mission would be. “Alas, I’ll wait until I see Wei and then try to persuade him to be cautious in the   Mountain Immortal City and not to venture out.”   “There’s only so much I can do.”   Standing up from the cushion, He Song sighed in his heart as he walked towards the exit of the cave mansion.   There was no other way.   If Wei Fan wanted to survive this war,   Being cautious was the only way to go.   Wei Fan was not Meng Guan, who could eat and drink in Mountain Immortal City for five years.   If Wei Fan wasn’t careful, he might lose his life.   After leaving the cave mansion,   He Song stepped out and immediately headed towards the Thick Earth Sect’s gate.   At the same time,   He sensed the spirit power within his body.   When he discovered that the spirit power in his body was gradually becoming abundant, and he should be able to reach the Qi Refining great perfection soon, A flash of delight appeared in his eyes.   After three years of cultivation, He Song was just one step away from Qi Refining great perfection.   Maybe, in another month, or at most two months, He Song would be able to step into Qi Refining great perfection, making Foundation Establishment within reach.   Three years, huh.   During these three years,   He Song had been in a small Spirit-Gathering Array, enjoying the spirit Qi gathered by the array alone.   Although his absorption of spirit Qi was slow due to his cultivation base, he was still cultivating at full speed.   In addition to other things that could improve his cultivation base,   He Song’s growth of spirit power within his body during these three years was not slow at all, and even faster than when he was in the Thick Earth Sect.   Under these circumstances, He Song was able to raise his cultivation base to the level of near Qi Refining great perfection just five years after breaking through the ninth-tier Qi Refining.   This time, if it weren’t for Wei Fan wanting to see him,   He Song’s plan of reaching Qi Refining great perfection through one seclusive cultivation session might have actually been realized.   But it didn’t matter.   Meeting Wei Fan wouldn’t take long.   At most one day, he could return to the Thick Earth Sect.   Once he returned to the cave mansion, it would only take him another month, or two months, to achieve Qi Refining great perfection.   With such thoughts in mind, He Song quickened his pace, wishing he could immediately go to the Thick Earth Sect and meet Wei Fan.   A few hours later,   He Song returned to the Thick Earth Sect.   Without stopping,   He Song’s figure quickly appeared outside Wei Fan’s cave mansion.   At the same time,   Wei Fan’s cave mansion door slowly opened.   “Seems like nothing has happened. However, Mr. He, you should be careful outside. With the war between our sect and the Seven Star Sect underway, there might be disciples of diabolism coming into our sect’s territory to cause   “Mr. He, you must be cautious.”   As soon as he saw He Song, Wei Fan took the initiative to remind him.   Before, when he went to He Song’s courtyard to find him, he found that the courtyard had long been empty.   Under such circumstances, Wei Fan searched in the sect for a while but couldn’t find He Song..

Chapter 174 - 174: 174: Being Too Cautious Translator: 549690339   However, by chance, they encountered Master Yuan Shan.   Master Yuan Shan. (From Chapter 124)   He was the master who blocked their way when He Song and the others first entered the Thick Earth Sect.   At that time, there was some unpleasantness between Master Yuan Shan and Master Qingy Yue.   However, the previous incidents were mainly due to the open and secret struggles between the two factions.   Now that the two factions have started to cooperate, the previous estrangement has not disappeared completely, but it has eased a lot.   At least.   Seeing that they were all fellow disciples, the masters from the two factions occasionally talked when they met each other, and their relationship was no longer as stiff as before.   However.   It was when Wei Fan met Master Yuan Shan.   Master Yuan Shan began talking to Wei Fan about He Song’s matters.   “Master Cheng Fu, I know that you are good friends with Master Duan Hun and the little fellow named He Song, and I envy the friendship between the three of you when I hear about it.”   “There are some things that are not easy to say, but if you run into that little fellow named He Song in the future, please tell him.”   “If there is an urgent matter in the future and he wants to leave the sect, just tell me.”   “It’s because of his close relationship with the two of you that he doesn’t betray the sect and leave. If it were someone else, perhaps they would have been caught as a spy and interrogated by now.”   As he spoke, Master Yuan Shan shook his head and looked quite helpless at the time.   He, along with several other Foundation Establishment Masters, were ordered to guard the mountain gate.   By chance, he discovered that He Song was using Earth Tunneling to leave the sect from the ground.   Had he not met He Song before, and known that He Song was good friends with Wei Fan and Meng Guan, and that the Sect Leader highly valued He Song and even gave him two Foundation Establishment Elixirs to help him break through to the Foundation Establishment stage,   he would have caught He Song on the spot and tortured him to find out his intentions for leaving the sect.   It was only because He Song’s identity was special and he was closely connected to the two Foundation Establishment Masters within the sect that he saw no reason for leaving the sect. As a result, Master Yuan Shan decided to   turn a blind eye.   He didn’t expose He Song for that reason.   However, after meeting Wei Fan this time and pondering over it, Master Yuan Shan decided to tell Wei Fan about it.   He wanted Wei Fan to tell He Song.   If he wanted to leave the sect in the future, he only needed to tell him, and he wouldn’t have to leave through Earth Tunneling.   Wei Fan was stunned when he heard this.   After a long silence, he finally understood.   No wonder he couldn’t find He Song in the Thick Earth Sect.   It turned out that He Song had already left the sect.   But… the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect are at war now, so why would He Song leave the sect at this time?   If it were not for their friendship of several decades, perhaps Wei Fan would have doubted He Song’s motives.   However, it was precisely because of this.   Master Yuan Shan knew about the relationship between He Song and Wei Fan and Meng Guan, so he didn’t suspect anything.   If it were someone else, they would have probably been caught and tortured when discovered leaving the sect using Earth Tunneling.   Immediately, Wei Fan smiled and promised.   And he secretly made a decision in his heart.   He planned to talk to He Song about this matter after he returned to the sect.   That’s why, as soon as He Song arrived, Wei Fan reminded him to be careful.   However, He Song was not aware of this situation at the moment.    Nor did he know.   That when he left the sect using Earth Tunneling, Master Yuan Shan had discovered him and had told Wei Fan about it.   “Well, thank you for the reminder, Wei. I will certainly be more careful in the future.”   He Song nodded to Wei Fan and expressed his gratitude.   He would naturally pay close attention to his own safety, even without Wei Fan’s words, He Song would have done so.   But now that Wei Fan had brought it up.   He Song could only show gratitude with a sentence in order to reassure Wei Fan.   Seeing this, Wei Fan didn’t say much either, and just took He Song into the cave mansion.   Inside the cave mansion.   Wei Fan and He Song sat face to face.   In front of the two, a pot of hot tea was sending out a rich fragrance.   “When I went to find friends today, do you know who I met in the Thick Earth Sect?”   After ushering He Song into the cave mansion, Wei Fan remembered what he had heard that day and asked immediately.   As he spoke.   Before He Song could reply, Wei Fan mentioned a name.   “Master Yuan Shan.”   After saying it, seeing the confusion on He Song’s face, a smile appeared on Wei Fan’s face.   “Speaking of which, this Master Yuan Shan has quite a fate with us.”   “When we had just entered the Thick Earth Sect, the master who stopped us was him.”   “Today, I met him and learned a very interesting matter.”   Looking at He Song, Wei Fan stopped talking, as if waiting for He Song to ask him.   But how could He Song not know his friend’s character after being friends for decades?   Upon seeing this.   He Song stared at his nose and breathed evenly, pretending he knew nothing, and silently sipped his tea.   On the side.   Seeing that He Song didn’t fall for it, Wei Fan waited for a while and continued to speak.   He didn’t wait for He Song to ask a question.   “Master Yuan Shan said that while he was guarding the mountain gate, he accidentally discovered a little fish swimming under his divine sense’s coverage,”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com   “Dear friend, do you know that there is a kind of little fish that can move in the ground?”   At this point, Wei Fan did not speak. He just looked at He Song, as if he wanted to watch He Song more closely before leaving. However, upon hearing Wei Fan say this, He Song’s eyes flashed with vigilance.   What kind of fish can travel in the ground?   Could it be that Master Yuan Shan, who was guarding the mountain gate, accidentally discovered him using Earth Tunneling to leave the mountain gate?   Otherwise, Wei Fan wouldn’t possibly hear any interesting stories from Master Yuan Shan when they met.   The two of them had never met before, and they had no leisurely time to chat.   Moreover, Wei his demeanor at the moment, it seemed as if he wanted to gauge He Song’s reaction. He Song gradually had a bottom line in his heart.   It seems that,   It was when he accidentally used Earth Tunneling to leave the sect one of those times when Yuan Shan discovered him.   But the number of times Yuan Shan discovered him should be just once.   If it were several times, Wei Fan would definitely say that the little fish was swimming around underground, not just swimming by once.   In this case,   He Song’s use of his Earth Tunneling strategy was completely correct.   Even a Foundation Establishment Realm Master’s divine sense could only discover him by chance for one time.    And he didn’t reduce the number of times he left the sect over these years.   There were not many times when he left the sect, but it was more than a dozen times at least.   But even so, he was discovered only once.   And that was when he was still using the ordinary Earth Tunneling Skill, which was when he was discovered.   Now,   When He Song goes out, he basically uses the Mountain Escaping Skill.   The Mountain Escaping Skill can tunnel tens of meters deep into the earth.   Even the divine sense of a Foundation Establishment Realm Master might not be able to probe tens of meters deep into the ground, right?   In such a case, although He Song knew that he was discovered by Yuan Shan once when he left the sect, he remained unflustered.   If nothing happened when he was discovered, nothing would happen in the future.   He had already exchanged his tactics; even if he tunneled under Yuan Shan’s feet every day from now on, Yuan Shan might not notice him.   Thinking about this, He Song looked at Wei Fan with a hint of helplessness in his eyes.   His good friend had no problems anywhere else.   But when it came to him and Meng Guan, Wei Fan always liked to use riddles.   However, Wei Fan was completely different when facing others and when facing He Song or Meng Guan.   Just like when He Song asked Wei Fan to kill Chen Zhou, Wei Fan didn’t hesitate to chase after him and strike.   He even almost killed Meng Guan, who had just emerged from the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   Fortunately, Meng Guan was quite witty at the time and immediately shouted “Wei” to save his life.   Now, looking at Wei Fan,   He Song couldn’t even connect the two Wei Fan with different personalities.   But after decades of getting along, He Song knew that this was the real Wei   Fan.   Being resolute and decisive with outsiders is him.   Being affectionate and brotherly on the inside is also him.   They are contradicting, but they belong to the same person.   “I haven’t seen a fish moving in the ground, but a few years ago, I learned an Earth Tunneling Skill that allows me to travel underground.”   He shook his head without revealing his secret. Instead, he volunteered a little token of information under Wei Fan’s brightening gaze.   That’s right.   Now, the Earth Tunneling Skill is just a small token for He Song, not even a trump card.   At this moment, He Song’s Earth Tunneling Skill is not an ordinary one but the Mountain Escaping Skill.   Since ordinary Earth Tunneling has already been exposed, and Yuan Shan and Wei Fan should already know, why not confess it?   Not only would it make Wei Fan happy, but it could also hide his true trump card, the Mountain Escaping Skill.   So, why not?   “Ahem, Master Yuan Shan asked me to tell you that if you want to leave the sect in the future, just let him know, and you don’t need to use Earth Tunneling Skill anymore.”   “Speaking of it, you haven’t changed your cautious nature in the past few decades.”   “You even need to use Earth Tunneling Skill to leave the sect. You won’t use Earth Tunneling Skill to travel when you go out, will you?”   After conveying Yuan Shan’s message to He Song, Wei Fan looked at He Song with a touch of helplessness in his eyes. To him,   He Song was indeed too cautious.   Initially, He Song was at the Qi Refining Early Stage, and he couldn’t beat anyone, so being cautious was understandable.   When He Song was at the Qi-refining mid stage, he couldn’t beat someone at the Qi-refining late stage, so being cautious was also understandable.   But now, He Song’s cultivation had reached the Qi-refining late stage, and he had two Foundation Establishment Realm friends. Being so cautious seemed unreasonable, right?   You have backers.   Two Foundation Establishment Realm Masters.   If you’re still so cautious, do you look down on your two brothers?   Back then, he was itching to take action after reaching the Qi-refining late stage, but he couldn’t find an opportunity while being in the Immortal Pavilion.   The only time he took action was when He Song asked him to kill Chen Zhou.

Chapter 175 - 175: 175: Qj Refining Great Perfection Translator: 549690339   Up until now, he had been in Foundation Establishment for ten years but had not taken any action even once.   Recalling that he had been wanting to make a move all these years, but there had never been an opportunity, Wei Fan couldn’t help but sigh.   However, his eyes brightened right away.   Next,   He would be going to the Mountain Immortal City.   What kind of place was the Mountain Immortal City?   It was the battlefront between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect.   Although there hadn’t been any large-scale conflicts between Foundation Establishment cultivators, it would be easy to act in Mountain Immortal City.   Although he might not be able to defeat any enemy cultivator in Foundation Establishment with his cultivation.   But even if he couldn’t defeat those in Foundation Establishment,   Fighting with Qi Refining cultivators or holding on for a while under the enemy’s Foundation Establishment attack was nothing to him.   At least, it was much easier than staying in the Immortal Pavilion or the Thick Earth Sect.   Back when he was in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, he didn’t have the opportunity to make a move.   After arriving in the Thick Earth Sect, there was even less opportunity to act.   Now, the sect leader sending him to the Mountain Immortal City was not the perfect chance for him to act?   With this thought flashing across his mind, Wei Fan looked at He Song, feeling that even his own feelings of parting had been swept away.   “Understood, I’ll let him know when I leave the sect.”   Ignoring Wei Fan’s doubts about how he would travel when he was outside, He   Song nodded and agreed.   This was a trivial matter.   He Song basically didn’t live in the Thick Earth Sect, and the chances were high that he would return to the sect to handle matters.   Once the matters were handled, he would naturally leave.   It is not a bad idea to visit Master Yuan Shan when he leaves the sect. As for whether or not it would be troublesome for Master Yuan Shan,   Since he had said that, He Song would most likely agree to it even if he had to bother him.   “However, Wei, you need to be extra careful when going to Mountain Immortal   City this time, as it is not like the sect, dangers could arise at any moment.” “If you see a dangerous situation, it is best to prioritize preserving your life.”   “Act together with Lao Meng, so you can support each other.”   “You must not be careless.”   Seeing that Wei Fan seemed to want to ask how he would travel when he was outside, He Song quickly changed the topic and began to admonish him.   Meng Guan had lived in Mountain Immortal City for several years.   In these years, he hadn’t heard of any dangers Meng Guan had encountered. Therefore, when admonishing Wei Fan, He Song also reminded him to act together with Meng Guan.   Two people together are always better than one person on their own.   Moreover, their relationship was extremely close, and they could even entrust their backs to each other.   In such a situation, having a trustworthy friend was definitely safer than acting alone.   “Don’t worry, I understand the word ‘caution’ very well, and I won’t do things I am unsure of.”   “By the way, do you think it will be safer if I use the Earth Tunneling Skill when I’m on the road?”   Wei Fan nodded, seemingly taking He Song’s advice to heart.   However, the question that came out of his mouth next left He Song speechless.   Ignoring Wei Fan’s question, He Song chatted with him for a while before personally sending him out of the mountain gate. At the Thick Earth Sect mountain gate,   He Song watched Wei Fan’s figure gradually disappear.   Like Meng Guan before, Wei Fan wasn’t flying toward the Mountain Immortal City, but was speeding across the land.   Both Meng Guan and Wei Fan were newly promoted Foundation Establishment cultivators.   They had not been exposed to the world, and Wei Fan had not even left the sect since his Foundation Establishment.    Therefore, the Seven Star Sect knew very little about them, and their identities were naturally best kept secret.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates   Residing in Mountain Immortal City every day, they could play an unexpected role in the face of enemy attacks.   Wei Fan’s figure disappeared into the distance,   He Song did not return to the Thick Earth Sect, but headed directly to his cave mansion.   By now,   He Song’s cultivation would soon reach Qi Refining great perfection.   It was only because Wei Fan was his friend that He Song had to leave seclusion to see him and send him off.   Otherwise, He Song would most likely still be in his cave mansion, struggling to break through to Qi Refining great perfection. How could he possibly be outside the cave mansion?   After sending Wei Fan off,   A few hours later,   He Song returned to his cave mansion.   Closing the cave mansion door,   He entered the quiet room.   Feeling the extraordinarily dense spirit Qi around him, He Song couldn’t help but take a deep breath, as if trying to inhale this dense spirit Qi directly into his belly.   However, spirit Qi was not to be taken in like this. He Song shook his head, sat down on the meditation cushion in the quiet room, and his expression instantly calmed down.   Next, no one should bother him.   This time in seclusion,   He would not break the seclusion until he achieved Qi Refining great perfection!   With firm determination in his eyes, He Song quickly immersed himself in cultivation.   Traces of spirit Qi were absorbed into his body and then continuously transformed into his spirit power under the operation of the Thick Earth Formulas   As time slowly passed,   The spirit power within He Song’s body gradually increased.   Over these three years,   Apart from mastering the Mountain Escaping Skill so that it could be applied at will without diminishing its power,   He also completely mastered the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill, which could be used at any time.   At the same time, He Song never forgot about the tool for his food.   After learning the Small Spirit-Gathering Array and Smoke Array, He Song shifted his focus to the other Array Skills recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction.   Many and varied Array Skills were recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction.   However, there were two Array Skills that He Song found particularly appealing.   One was an offensive Array.   The other was a defensive Array.   There were many offensive Array Skills, which dazzled He Song’s eyes.   In the end, after careful consideration, He Song chose one of them as his next research subject.   Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array.   An offensive Array Skill.   After refining the Array Disk and Array Banners, the array could be set up whenever needed.   After activating the Array, enemies could be trapped inside and burned with celestial fire, producing great power.   Of course, the celestial fire in the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array was only spirit fire transformed from spirit Qi and not actual celestial fire.   It was just called by this name to make it appear more domineering.   The celestial fire in the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array could burn spirit power, and as time passed, those who entered the Array would not only have to rely on their spirit power to resist the fire’s burning but also bear the huge consumption of spirit power caused by the fire’s burning.   If they could not break through the Array or forcibly destroy its core in a short time, their spirit power would soon be exhausted and they would be at the mercy of others.   He Song chose to study this Array because of its ability to burn spirit power.   Not for anything else.   It was because he would soon enter the Foundation Establishment stage.   After successfully breaking through to Foundation Establishment, he would be able to learn the Soul Searching Skill.   In this way.    He would first use the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array to disperse the enemy’s spirit power and then release them, followed by a Soul Searching Skill session.   That scene…   Ordinary people would probably not dare to try it.   However, as He Song’s enemies, even if they did not dare, He Song would make sure they experienced it.   As for the defensive Array Skills.   He Song had not yet decided which one he wished to study.   However, once the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array was completed and successfully set up, He Song’s next target would naturally fall on the defensive Array Skills.   Time.   Slowly passed in the process of He Song’s continuous cultivation.   In tne blink ot an eye.   A whole month had passed.   During this month.   He Song spent all his time outside of his daily practice studying the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array.   His understanding of the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array also progressed by leaps and bounds.   In addition, He Song immersed himself in cultivation every day, unable to extricate himself.   Not until one day.   In the quiet room.   He Song sat cross-legged on a cushion, with strands of spirit Qi constantly pouring into his body from all directions.   However, just as he thought his cultivation for the day was going as expected.   A strong sense of obscurity suddenly emerged from his body.   He Song’s brows furrowed, and he immediately felt a strong discomfort.   This feeling.   It was like he was eating food while already full, yet his hand still wanted to stuff more food into his stomach, as if his entire body was resisting the entry of food.   At this moment, He Song felt that the spirit power in his meridians had become incredibly obscure.   Even if there was spirit Qi from the outside entering, it was still impossible to convert those strands of spirit Qi into spirit power through the Thick Earth Formulas.   After sensing the obscurity in his meridians.   He Song opened his eyes.   “Qi Refining great perfection, achieved!”   With a hint of joy on his face, He Song didn’t mind the discomfort the obscurity in his meridians had just brought him.   Qi Refining great perfection.   The spirit power within the body is saturated.   No matter how much one practices, the spirit power in one’s body will no longer increase by even a little bit.   Upon reaching this stage, it is called Qi Refining great perfection.   From now on, only by successfully breaking through to Foundation Establishment can one become stronger.   As for the scenarios of practicing Qi refining for tens of thousands of years and dominating the world upon emerging, these are impossible.   The body cannot hold that much spirit power.   Even the slightest bit more spirit Qi absorbed will be rejected and one’s cultivation will no longer make any progress.   This is the body’s limit.   It is also the limit of the Qi Refining stage.   After successfully cultivating to Qi Refining great perfection, He Song naturally emerged from his seclusion.   Leaving the quiet room.   Arriving outside the cave mansion.   He Song’s eyes swept over the surrounding scenery, a satisfied look flashing through them.   This was the location of the cave mansion he had personally selected.   Naturally, he was extremely content with the scenery here.   Now, after breaking through to Qi Refining great perfection, being in such beautiful surroundings would make He Song’s mood even more peaceful, allowing him to find the opportunity to break through to Foundation Establishment more quickly.   Breaking through to Foundation Establishment.   It requires an opportunity.   At some point in time, a desire to attempt a breakthrough will arise in a cultivator’s heart..

Chapter 176 - 176: 176: Attempting Foundation Establishment Translator: 549690339   If during that time, one has a sufficient supply of elixirs, a relatively safe environment, and someone to protect them, they can attempt to break through to Foundation Establishment on the spot.   Like Meng Guan and Wei Fan, when the two were trying to break through to   Foundation Establishment, they both went into a quiet chamber and looked for the opportunity within,   As for He Song.   With the Smoke Array hiding him, He Song didn’t need to look for opportunities in a cramped chamber like Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   On the contrary.   He Song could walk freely within the coverage of the Smoke Array.   Even if he walked several miles away, he could attempt a breakthrough to   Foundation Establishment anywhere and anytime.   It’s not that He Song didn’t value his safety.   It’s because he could control the Smoke Array to hide himself at any time.   When inside the Smoke Array, with a small Spirit-Gathering Array providing spiritual Qi within the cave mansion for He Song, naturally, there would be no disturbances when he tried to break through Foundation Establishment.   The small Spirit-Gathering Array supplying the spirit field.   As well as the small Spirit-Gathering Array supplying He Song’s daily cultivation.   There were two small Spirit-Gathering Arrays within the range of the Smoke Array, which were enough for He Song to make a breakthrough here without absorbing the spiritual Qi from other areas around him.   Thus, even if someone came to this place while He Song was trying to break through Foundation Establishment, they wouldn’t discover that He Song was actually establishing his foundation nearby.   Under such circumstances, as long as He Song was around his cave mansion, he naturally wouldn’t have to worry about his safety.   Walking down the small hill.   He Song took one step at a time towards the river not far away.   He Song didn’t know the name of this river, but considering that there had never been any boats in it, there should be no mortal gatherings upstream or downstream of it.   Or there might have been some in the past, but they eventually vanished.   Without any curiosity about this, He Song came to the riverside, listening to the rushing water flowing by his ears and the occasional splashes of leaping fish; his entire being suddenly became calm.   However.   After standing for a long time.   He Song shook his head and opened his eyes.   “Back when Lao Meng and Wei were trying to establish their foundations, they both entered the quiet chamber, then after a few days, they succeeded.”   “It seems that within a few days, an opportunity for Foundation Establishment should appear.”   “If not, I’ll wait a little longer.”   Picking up a cobblestone from the riverside and throwing it into the river, He Song’s mood relaxed as the series of splashes rose.   Foundation Establishment.   It cannot be rushed.   The opportunity for Foundation Establishment.   It won’t appear just because I’m anxious.   After figuring out this matter, He Song’s urgency for Foundation Establishment also slowed down a bit.   I am an everlasting being after all.   As long as I’m not killed by anyone, I can live forever.   To live until the end of time, until the sea dries up and the rocks rot, until the world changes and the stars shift.   In the endless years, all I can do is to constantly make myself stronger and ensure my personal safety.   At the same time, if I can live a more comfortable life, that would be even better.   Also.    As an everlasting being, I don’t need to be in a hurry.   My time is always more than enough.   As his mood gradually calmed down, He Song casually picked up another cobblestone, just about to throw it forward, but he faintly felt that there was something wrong with the cobblestone in his hand.   Too round.   Even though cobblestones are generally round.   But being this round was rather abnormal.   Just as He Song wondered and looked at the cobblestone in his hand, what appeared before him made a hint of astonishment emerge on his face.   “What is this? A round white cobblestone? Or a round white jade? Or an egg laid by something?”   After carefully examining the egg-like object that resembled white jade in his hand, He Song thought for a while but still couldn’t determine whether this was a cobblestone, a piece of white jade, or an egg laid by some creature.   This object was oval, with a surface as white as jade, no sound when shaken, and a shadow in its center when exposed to sunlight, but it was impossible to determine how the shadow was formed. Is it impurities in the cobblestone?   Or impurities in the white jade?   Or yolk of the egg?   He Song contemplated for a moment, and a sudden flash of light appeared in his eyes.   If he couldn’t see anything on the surface, he would use the Spirit Vision Skill to see.   For cultivators, everything without spiritual Qi is garbage.   Even if a cobblestone by the roadside contains spiritual Qi, to cultivators, it is still a spirit stone.   A flash of light.   He Song’s expression changed.   It’s an egg!   Although the spiritual Qi contained in this egg was thin, at least it contained some spiritual Qi, and at the same time, He Song also saw signs of life in the egg using the spirit vision skill.   In other words.   Perhaps this egg could hatch something.   Bringing the egg to his eyes, He Song carefully observed it but ultimately couldn’t tell what kind of egg it was.   After thinking about it, He Song looked around to see if there were any other eggs nearby. Only when he didn’t find any did he take this nameless egg back to the cave mansion with him.   Inside the cave mansion.   Putting the egg he had just picked up on the table, He Song glanced at the fragrant spirit rice not far away, then looked at the egg in front of him.   Eat?   Or incubate?   That is the question.   Eating it would satisfy one’s appetite for a moment.   Incubating it, on the other hand, would result in a clueless pet.   Given the faint spirit Qi contained in this egg, whatever hatches from it will likely not possess a high level of intelligence.   Naturally, even if it were to be raised as a pet here, He Song would not have to worry about his secrets being exposed.   Moreover, having an extra small pet by one’s side can help guard the house.   Not that he would rely on this little pet to face his foes.   But it would also be good for relieving boredom.   After some contemplation,   He Song ultimately decided to incubate the egg and see what happens.   If something with high intelligence hatches, he’ll turn it into a dish.   If something with worrisome intelligence hatches, he’ll use a Beast Mastery Token to capture it as a spirit pet to guard his place.   Beast Taming, is one of the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   A Beast Mastery Token can be easily purchased at any Immortal Pavilion shop.    But the price is a bit expensive for Qi Refining cultivators.   However, for He Song now, a small Beast Mastery Token is nothing more than a small expense for some peace of mind.   With the Beast Master Token, he can bind the hatched creature.   He can control the life and death of the spirit pet at any time.   Even if it escapes when he’s not paying attention, Or if it’s captured by someone who wants to search its soul for his secrets,   Or even if it secretly harbors rebellious thoughts,   He can simply use the Beast Mastery Token to erase its soul completely at any time.   Having such a convenient Beast Mastery Token is the main reason why He Song thought of incubating the egg in the first place.   Given He Song’s cautious character,   He would definitely prefer not to deal with things he can’t control. A spirit pet, on the other hand, is something he can easily control.   Upon the master’s command,   Even if they are unwilling, they must charge forward.   Charging might mean nine deaths and one life,   But not doing so would mean certain death.   After picking up an egg by the riverbank, He Song found a suitable place for it to incubate and then returned to his search for an opportunity to establish his Foundation.   so,   A few days later,   At some moment,   He Song, who was standing at the peak of the mountain, suddenly felt a sense of urgency to begin attempting Foundation Establishment. Upon realizing this, a faint hint of joy flashed through his eyes.   For several days,   The opportunity for Foundation Establishment had never arrived.   But now, after waiting so painstakingly for several days, the long-awaited moment had come without any warning.   Currently, He Song had six Foundation Establishment Elixirs on him.   And he was inside the Smoke Array, where his presence and aura were completely concealed, so he didn’t need to worry about his safety. In addition, two small Spirit-Gathering Arrays inside the Smoke Array provided him with spirit Qi.   This way, even if he begins Foundation Establishment right now, no person or thing could disturb his breakthrough.   As for the egg… To avoid failing his first attempt at Foundation Establishment because of it, He Song had already thrown it into a hidden spot tens of miles away, allowing it to quietly incubate there.   He would never keep such an item of unknown origin by his side before it has hatched and been restricted by the Beast Mastery Token. Although a newly born cub would definitely pose no threat to him,   This was a crucial time for He Song.   Foundation Establishment was not a period during which any accidents could be permitted.   At the mountain peak,   He Song faced the east and gently sat cross-legged on a cushion.   With his eyes closed,   He started to transfer all the spirit power contained in his body to his Elixir Field without using the Thick Earth Formulas.   According to Meng Guan and Wei Fan, as well as other Foundation   Establishment-stage Masters’ insights in the Book Collection Pavilion,   To establish a foundation, one needed to direct all the spirit power in their body to their Elixir Field.   When the Elixir Field is filled to the brim, and all the spirit power in the body is directed into it,   One can then begin compressing the abundant spirit power in their Elixir Field.   The moment a sliver of mana is produced from the compressed spirit power is the moment successful Foundation Establishment.   Following that, they just need to proceed step by step, transforming all the spirit power in their body into mana in order to consolidate their cultivation and leave seclusion.   As for the cultivation after Foundation Establishment Realm,   It is, of course, similar to the Qi Refining stage, where one absorbs spirit Qi from the surroundings and turns it into mana, thus gaining enhanced mana and increasing one’s strength.   He recalled the Foundation Establishment experiences imparted by Meng Guan and Wei Fan, as well as the insights he had read in the Book Collection Pavilion.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m   After recalling every single Foundation Establishment experience and firmly memorizing their key points,   He Song began, unhurriedly, to move all the spirit power he could manipulate in his body toward his Elixir Field..

Chapter 177: Chapter 177: Shocking Foundation Establishment   Translator: 549690339   For other cultivators attempting to reach the Foundation Establishment, this step could be incredibly challenging.   The spirit power within their bodies is actually quite vast for a cultivator at the Qi Refining great perfection.   Normally, controlling the spirit power within the body to cycle and absorb spirit Qi to transform it into their own spirit power is entirely different from the experience of gathering all their available spirit power to the Elixir Field.   The former just requires urging the spirit power to move along the meridians and keep cycling.   While the latter needs to manipulate every strand of spirit power that can be controlled in the body and bring them all into the Elixir Field. The workload between these two is utterly dissimilar.   One follows the natural course.   The other needs absolute precision.   However, thanks to having the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill that increases the success rate of reaching the Foundation Establishment, He Song finds this step relatively easy.   After an initial attempt, He Song thought it was too slow to gather the spirit power into the Elixir Field bit by bit.   Moreover, it was extremely exhausting for his mind, which was not conducive to the subsequent spirit power compression, so He Song decisively used the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill.   With a single thought.   The Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill was activated.   In an instant, He Song felt the spirit power within his body swarm towards his Elixir Field.   Regardless whether it was the spirit power circulating within his meridians or the spirit power contained within his limbs and bones.   At this moment.   Everything seemed to be summoned, swarming into He Song’s Elixir Field.   Within just a short time, He Song felt that all the spirit power in his body had entered his Elixir Field.   At the same time.   He Song also felt his body quickly weakening.   Although a cultivator’s body appears to be strong, it is only because of the spirit power protecting it.   When all the spirit power inside the body converges into the Elixir Field, the body’s strength will naturally be comparable to that of an ordinary person.   Perhaps it is still somewhat more resilient than the body of an ordinary person, but when compared to the body of a cultivator, it appears exceptionally weak.   “It seems that after reaching the Foundation Establishment, I will need to learn a body refining technique.”   Feeling the weakness within his body, He Song was reminded in his heart. If he had learned a body refining technique by now, this phenomenon would never have occurred.   If there were some extreme situations in the future.   If he had learned a body refining technique earlier, perhaps it could save his life.   For the sake of his own future survival.   After becoming alert, He Song felt that all the spirit power within his body had entered his Elixir Field and had been firmly bound within it.   With a thought, six small jade bottles appeared before He Song.   He reached out to grab the jade bottles and opened them one by one.   Immediately.   A rich fragrance emanated from the six small jade bottles in front of He Song.   As soon as he caught a whiff, He Song felt a surge of strength in his body.   Seeing this, He Song’s mind was shaken.   Indeed, the Foundation Establishment Elixir is truly terrifying in its effectiveness.   But, it was not the time to contemplate this.   At the moment, He Song had already bound all the spirit power within his body to his Elixir Field. All he needed to do was to take the Foundation Establishment Elixir and allow its medicinal power to help him compress his spirit power as much as possible.   With the assistance of six Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   It was reasonable to assume that He Song would find the compression of spirit power much easier during the process.            Six Foundation Establishment Elixirs!   Ordinarily, a cultivator having just one Foundation Establishment Elixir would greatly bolster their confidence in reaching the Foundation Establishment.   While just one of these Elixirs increased the success rate slightly, it could still drive some loose cultivators at Qi Refining great perfection into madness.   For loose cultivators, having a single Foundation Establishment Elixir is considered great fortune.   For disciples of sects and children of aristocratic families, having one Foundation Establishment Elixir and some insights from seniors regarding the Foundation Establishment is already a great resource.   But for He Song.   Foundation Establishment Elixirs? He has six!   Foundation Establishment insights? He has read many, and even received personal instruction from two Foundation Establishment Masters!   Moreover, He Song also has the secret skill of Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill that can increase the success rate of reaching the Foundation Establishment.   With the blessing of these things.   At this moment, He Song, who was sitting cross-legged at the peak of a mountain and preparing to make a breakthrough to the Foundation   Establishment Realm, did not believe that his attempt at reaching the Foundation Establishment would end in failure.   He opened his mouth.   A Foundation Establishment Elixir entered He Song’s stomach.   Immediately after, He Song felt a powerful medicinal effect that enveloped the area around his Elixir Field as soon as the Elixir entered his stomach.   Apart from this medicinal effect that assisted He Song in compressing the spirit power in his Elixir Field.   Another part of the medicinal power spread throughout his limbs and bones, as well as the outer part of his Elixir Field.   This portion of the medicinal power had no effect in helping He Song compress the spirit power in his Elixir Field.   It would only function when the spirit power in the Elixir Field went out of control due to a failed breakthrough attempt, in which case this medicinal power would protect He Song from dying on the spot due to failed Foundation Establishment.   Upon feeling that these two parts of the medicinal power were ready, He Song still did not start ms Foundation Establlsnment process.   On the contrary.   After realizing that a single Foundation Establishment Elixir contained two types of medicinal power, He Song did not hesitate to consume the remaining five Foundation Establishment Elixirs all at once.   Immediately, a surge of powerful medicinal effects spread through He Song’s body, making him feel a rush of hot blood straight to his forehead.   Six Foundation Establishment Elixirs were ingested, and at the location of He Song’s Elixir Field, the medicinal effects had almost solidified. He Song only needed to sense it slightly to detect the supportive effects of this power.   The Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill was used.   Another six Foundation Establishment Elixirs were ingested.   Now, it was time for him to launch an assault towards Foundation Establishment!   Determination flashed in He Song’s eyes, and with a wave of his hand, countless dazzling spirit stones appeared around him.   Under the sunlight, the spirit stones placed around He Song looked incredibly dazzling.   At this moment, He Song sat in the midst of these spirit stones, and the abundant spirit Qi around him even gave him the illusion that he was within a spirit stone vein.   After doing all this, He Song still felt that it wasn’t secure enough.   After some thought, he took all the other spirit stones from his body and placed them around him.   Although he was not sure if placing spirit stones beside him could increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment.   But since breaking through the Qi-refining mid stage and Qi-refining late stage both had an increased chance when spirit stones were placed nearby, it should be the same for attempting Foundation Establishment.   Other cultivators couldn’t, like him, place tens of thousands of spirit stones around themselves.   That was because they were poor.   He Song was not poor.   Thus, he could make such an attempt.   After doing all this and feeling the increased concentration of spirit Qi around him, He Song finally closed his eyes in peace and began attempting Foundation Establishment.   With closed eyes.   He Song immediately felt the location of his Elixir Field.            The spirit power firmly restrained in his Elixir Field was now waiting for him to compress them.   The tremendous medicinal power generated from the Foundation Establishment Elixirs was also waiting for him.   At this moment, as long as He Song had a thought, the spirit power he firmly restrained in his Elixir Field would be compressed for the first time.   He calmed his emotions.   He Song then made a mental move.   Compress spirit power!   With the assistance of the powerful medicinal effects within his body, He Song quickly started his first attempt to compress his spirit power.   During the first compression of spirit power, He Song mustered all his strength and directly compressed the spirit power in his Elixir Field to his own limits.   Feeling that he could no longer make any progress, He Song then firmly restrained the spirit power in his Elixir Field that had been compressed once, while secretly gathering his strength.   Only when he felt that he had gathered enough strength and was ready to compress the spirit power in his Elixir Field again did he attempt the second compression of spirit power.   This method.   It was first proposed by Meng Guan and then tested twice by Wei Fan, resulting in a method that could maximize the compression of the spirit power in the Elixir Field.   Even the Foundation Establishment Masters from the Thick Earth Sect used a similar method when compressing spirit power during their breakthroughs to Foundation Establishment.   When He Song was reading in the Book Collection Pavilion, he had seen many insights from the Thick Earth Sect’s Foundation Establishment Masters regarding Foundation Establishment.   In these insights, methods like this one were often used.   Benefitting from the experiences of predecessors, He Song naturally wouldn’t explore other methods on his own.   Moreover, with Wei Fan and Meng Guan’s successful examples, the feasibility of this method had been confirmed. Naturally, He Song had nothing to hesitate about.   Thus, after the first and second compressions.   He quickly prepared to compress his spirit power for the third time.   According to Meng Guan and Wei Fan’s descriptions.   Compressing spirit power in the Elixir Field required many attempts before a trace of mana could be successfully created.   This number was fixed.   Eleven was the limit.   More than eleven would result in failure. Less than eleven would result in success.   For example, Meng Guan.   It was during his tenth compression of spirit power that the first trace of mana was born within his Elixir Field.   If he hadn’t birthed that trace of mana during his tenth compression, he would’ve likely failed Foundation Establishment and become an ordinary person.   As for Wei Fan.   Because Wei Fan had experienced one failure in Foundation Establishment, the insights he shared with He Song about Foundation Establishment were more comprehensive.   During Wei Fan’s first attempt at Foundation Establishment. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com  He compressed his spirit power in his Elixir Field a total of ten times.   Unfortunately, he still couldn’t compress the first trace of mana after the tenth compression.   As a result.   Wei Fan’s first attempt at Foundation Establishment ended in failure.   At the same time, he provided He Song with an accurate number.   If the spirit power in the Elixir Field didn’t produce a trace of mana after ten compressions, Foundation Establishment would fail, and the cultivator would be severely injured.   Two years later, Wei Fan began his second attempt at Foundation Establishment.   This time, Wei Fan compressed the spirit power in his Elixir Field only nine times before suddenly feeling a trace of mana appear in it.   After operating this trace of mana and continuously transforming his body’s spirit power into mana.   Wei Fan’s second Foundation Establishment attempt succeeded.   This time, Wei Fan compressed his spirit power less than ten times before he birthed a trace of mana.   Comparing the two attempts, He Song naturally understood that the “limit of eleven” had no errors.   That is to say.   As long as He Song could create the first trace of mana within his Elixir Field within the ten compressions of spirit power.   He would successfully establish his Foundation..

Chapter 178 - 178: 178: Successful Foundation Establishment Translator: 549690339   If it fails, then foundation establishment has failed.   Now, He Song is preparing for the third spirit power compression, he still has many chances.   A flash of determination glinted in his eyes, He Song, with the aid of the six Foundation Establishment Elixirs in his body, silently gathered power, steadily advancing towards his Foundation Establishment.   The third time.   The fourth time.   The fifth .   At one point.   When He Song once again exerted all his strength to compress the spirit power in his Elixir Field, continuously making the spirit power within his Elixir Field thicker.   An unprecedented sense of comfort momentarily surged in He Song’s heart.   In this moment.   He Song distinctly felt that there was a powerful force being born within his Elixir Field.   Upon sensing this, He Song was instantly taken aback.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com   This is…a sign of mana birth!   The next moment, without hesitation, He Song continued to squeeze out all the spirit power in his body.   Simultaneously, that powerful force inside his Elixir Field, as He Song continued compressing the spirit power, was becoming increasingly terrifying.   When He Song perceived that the force within his Elixir Field was fully formed, a sense of heart-mind connectivity also instantly emerged in his heart.   Spirit power, when compressed to the extreme, gives birth to mana.   Only when one has successfully birthed the first strand of mana, can a cultivator step into Foundation Establishment, becoming a true cultivator!   Anything below Foundation Establishment is just a stage that one must pass through in the transition from an ordinary person to a cultivator.   As for mana.   The biggest difference from spirit power.   Is its characteristic of being connected with the cultivator’s intention.   Spirit power, is just a power.   Controlling spirit power, in essence, there is no difference between using a knife or a sword by an ordinary person.   But as for mana, it is equivalent to a third hand, a third eye, a third ear, a third…   Mana moves with the heart, a unified heart and intention leads to mana following one’s heart.   For instance, operating Artifacts.   Using spirit power to operate Artifacts is equivalent to ordinary people wielding knives and swords.   While operating Artifacts with mana is like the sword being an extension of oneself, with one intention of mind, mana can closely follow.   This is also why a master of Foundation Establishment can launch an attack from a great distance.   A master of Foundation Establishment.   Even if it is just the Early Stage of Foundation Establishment, the range covered by their divine sense is as far as two miles.   Such a long distance, if spirit power is used, naturally, it would not reach that far.   But if one operates with mana, the mana flowing out can reach the place covered by divine sense in an instant.   Therefore, launching an attack from a far distance becomes a very usual matter.   At the top of the small mountain.   He Song was silently seated.   At the same time as the first strand of mana was born in his Elixir Field.   He originally just wanted to operate the mana in his body, converting all the remaining spirit power in his Elixir Field into mana.   However, at the moment when the mana was born, He Song suddenly felt a darkness before his eyes.   When he regained consciousness, he found himself floating in mid-air.   But the current He Song cannot use his eyes to look far, he could only vaguely sense some things around him.   The mountain peak, He Song’s sitting figure, was sensed by He Song.   At the same time, around his own figure, mountain rocks, trees, and soil, all could be sensed.   Upon noticing this.   He Song suddenly realized.            When the spirit power in his Elixir Field was successfully compressed into a   thread of mana, that mana would nourish the cultivator’s divine soul, and assist in birthing divine sense.   Whether it’s Meng Guan or Wei Fan.   When talking about the understanding related to Foundation Establishment with He Song, both of them have mentioned it.   The process of birthing divine sense is actually very simple.   He Song, floating in mid-air, is equivalent to stretching out the divine sense, sensing the surroundings.   At this moment, He Song’s divine soul is being transformed into divine sense by that little bit of mana.   Only when the first wisp of divine sense is successfully birthed, will He Song’s perception appear mid-air.   However, at this moment He Song’s divine sense is just born, he needs to wait until the divine soul is completely transformed into divine sense, only then will his perception fall from the air and return to his body.   In this way, He Song also understood.   Why, whether it was Meng Guan or Wei Fan, when they successfully broke through the Foundation Establishment and came out, they were clear about everything in the outside world.   Originally, cultivators during Foundation Establishment aren’t only able to see what they themselves can see.   At the time of divine sense birth, they can sense all kinds of things around them.   The sound of speaking.   The placement of items.   And the actions of the people around.   All of these can be vaguely sensed.   However, if you want to fully perceive these things, you need to contact them with divine sense. If it’s just swept over from mid-air, you can only vaguely sense the surroundings.   For example, He song at this moment could only sense his own body and some nearby mountain rocks, trees, etc.   The vague sense will be lost beyond ten meters.   Only when the divine sense contacts an object, or an animal, or even a person, can the sense of the divine sense be maximized.   Of course, if you really use divine sense to contact.   That would be similar to directly touching with your hand.   In the Cultivation World.   Touching someone else with divine sense is a major taboo.   If what is touched happens to be a female cultivator… it’s probably a fight to the death.   In this very moment.   The first thread of mana has appeared in He Song’s Elixir Field.   His divine soul was also gradually transforming into divine sense.   During this time.   Foundation Establishment cultivators are actually quite fragile.   Even if an ordinary person were to come along, they could decapitate the cultivator with a single strike.   This is why cultivators usually seek the protection of their closest friends, or parents and masters, when making a breakthrough in Foundation Establishment.   With someone to protect the law, it’s naturally safer when breaking through to Foundation Establishment.   However, He Song does not need to worry about this.   Staying within the Smoke Array, his safety can still be guaranteed.   After a while.   He Song’s consciousness returned to his body.   That strand of mana had successfully transformed He Song’s divine soul into a divine sense.   At this moment, as his consciousness returned to his body, He Song did not bother to try to find out how far his divine sense could perceive; instead, he focused his attention on his Elixir Field.   Now.   He Song has established his foundation.   The spirit power in his Elixir Field should naturally transform into He Song’s own mana as soon as possible.   This transformation process still requires a considerable amount of time.   Focusing his attention on his Elixir Field, with a thought, He Song started circulating the Thick Earth Formulas.   That strand of mana immediately surged from his Elixir Field and began to circulate in his meridians.   Under the operation of the Thick Earth Formulas, that strand of mana gradually absorbed the other spirit power in He Song’s Elixir Field and became stronger.   One strand.            Two strands.   Three strands.   A few days later.   After He Song’s continuous operation of the cultivation skill these days.   All the spirit power in He Song’s body has disappeared, and at the same time, the spirit Qi from the outside world has been continuously absorbed by him and transformed into mana.   While transforming the spirit power in his body into mana, He Song also absorbs the spirit Qi from the outside world to speed up the transformation.   At this moment, cultivators who have just broken through to Foundation Establishment absorb spirit Qi from the outside world at an extremely rapid rate.   At the same time, this is why there is usually a small whirlpool of spirit Qi above those cultivators who have just broken through to Foundation Establishment.   There is not enough spirit Qi where they are, so they have to draw spirit Qi from afar.   Thus, a whirlpool of spirit Qi forms.   But He Song is different.   He is in the Smoke Array, with two small Spirit-Gathering Arrays inside and tens of thousands of spirit stones around him.   Under such circumstances, the amount of spirit Qi around He Song is definitely sufficient.   Therefore.   In these few days, there has been no particular phenomenon such as whirlpools of spirit Qi in He Song’s location.   Without any distinctive occurrence, naturally it will not attract the attention of other cultivators.   This had been planned by He Song in advance.   Now, after several days, his meridians and Elixir Field are filled with a considerable amount of mana.   This mana, some of it is transformed from his original spirit power, while some of it, is produced in these few days by absorbing the spirit Qi from the outside world.   The current He Song, just needs a single thought, the mana in his body can be used as freely as his own limbs, constantly circulating in the meridians, thereby absorbing the spirit Qi from the outside world and transforming it into his own mana.   Although, to transform spirit Qi into mana, a considerable amount is needed.   However, for He Song.   As long as cultivation can increase mana, everything else is of secondary importance.   After these few days, when his body has completely become filled with mana, He Song then casually circulates the Thick Earth Formulas, and his attention quickly shifts to his divine sense.   Under normal circumstances.   After several days of consolidation, He Song should have left the confinement by now.   From the moment he emerges from the seclusion.   He is a newly established Foundation Establishment Master.   Status.   Position.   Power.   Strength.   All have taken a huge step forward.   There is an enormous gulf between the Qi refining stage he was in before and now.   However, after consolidating his cultivation base and thoroughly stabilizing his cultivation at the Foundation Establishment Realm, He Song did not leave isolation immediately.   He instead started to study divine sense.   Divine sense.   It is transformed from the divine soul.   The stronger the divine soul, the stronger the divine sense that is transformed from it.   He Song is a transmigrator.   Ever since he arrived at this world, his divine soul has always been much stronger than other people in this world.   Therefore, after his divine soul is transformed into divine sense, He Song wants to know if his divine sense would be stronger than that of others.   As soon as he thought of it, he took action.   While circulating the Thick Earth Formulas and continuously absorbing the surrounding spirit Qi, He Song also made a thought and probed his divine sense.   The sensation of exploring with divine sense is very peculiar.   In the desolate Smoke Array, He Song can freely probe with his divine sense and scan everything within the Smoke Array.   As his divine sense probes, he scans all around.   Soil, rocks, trees, fallen leaves, running water, the sound of the wind…   Everything he sensed appeared in He Song’s mind and, after being processed by his divine sense, an extremely vivid flat map was immediately constructed in his mind.   Where his divine sense scans, it is clearly reflected in this flat map.   But, it is merely a flat map, not a three-dimensional image.   With a movement of He Song’s heart, his divine sense suddenly spread rapidly around him, with He Song at the center..        

Chapter 179 - 179: 179: Blood Escape Skill Translator: 549690339   This time, when He Song’s divine sense enveloped all directions and rapidly expanded to a three-mile radius, the scene that appeared in his perception made He Song’s eyes widen in an instant.   At this moment, He Song had a clear understanding of everything within a three-mile radius around him.   No matter it was the tiny crawlers in the depths of the earth.   Or the willow catkins drifting in the sky.   Or even the leaves rustling in the wind.   All of these things appeared in He Song’s perception.   As long as He Song wanted, even a tiny grain of sand could be clearly sensed.   “A radius of three miles?”   “This means, my divine sense is considerably stronger than that of ordinary cultivators.”   “About half more.”   “No wonder my learning speed for skills and the practice of Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth is faster than ordinary cultivators.”   He Song immediately understood the reason for this when he enveloped all within a three-mile radius with his divine sense, and his thoughts moved.   I am a transmigrator.   After crossing over, I even got the memories of my previous self.   As a result, my soul’s strength is naturally much stronger than others.   With my stronger soul, naturally, my divine sense will be more powerful after it is born.   Under such circumstances, it is normal for my divine sense coverage range to be one-mile more than ordinary Early Foundation Establishment Cultivators.   A stronger divine sense than other cultivators gives He Song advantages in learning skills, practicing Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, or manipulating Artifacts with divine sense.   It’s quite a good benefit.   With a hint of satisfaction in his eyes, He Song withdrew his divine sense. Then he suddenly extended it again, trying to see if he could exceed the three-mile range.   Unfortunately,   No matter how He Song tried, his divine sense coverage range or probing range could not exceed the three-mile limit.   Even if his divine sense was concentrated into a single line and probed in one direction, it could not exceed the three-mile limitation.   After realizing this, He Song sighed and finally retracted his divine sense. “It seems that the furthest range of my divine sense is three miles.”   “If there is a breakthrough in my cultivation in the future, it should continue to grow. As for now…l don’t know if there are any elixirs that can increase divine sense.”   “If I can find some, I’ll have to buy some and give them a try.”   With such a thought in his mind, He Song soon ceased his cultivation and stood up on the mountain peak.   His cultivation had been consolidated.   His divine sense had been used freely.   It was time to come out of seclusive cultivation.   And start walking the world as a newly-minted Foundation Establishment Master!   Feeling the mana contained within his body, He Song’s gaze swept around, only to see the spirit stones still shining brightly on the ground, as if they had not been consumed at all.   Seeing this, He Song casually collected these spirit stones, with a hint of helplessness flashing in his eyes.   It seems that having spirit stones around him during the Foundation Establishment breakthrough did not increase the success rate.   His previous preparations had been in vain.   However, He Song didn’t care too much about it.   After all, it was just an attempt. Even if it had no effect, he still succeeded in his Foundation Establishment.    With one last glance around, He Song’s figure soon disappeared from the mountain peak.   Breaking through the Foundation Establishment on the mountain peak was just a coincidence.   It would be better to familiarize himself with the ins and outs of the Foundation Establishment Realm in his own cave mansion.   Soon,   He Song returned to his cave mansion.   Sitting cross-legged in his quiet room.   All the experiences during his Foundation Establishment breakthrough flashed through He Song’s mind.   “If my memory is correct, my mana was born during the seventh compression of spirit power.”   “For other Foundation Establishment cultivators, their mana is usually born during the ninth or tenth compression of spirit power.”   “As for me, because of the six Foundation Establishment Elixirs, the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill, and the Foundation Establishment insights I acquired earlier, the time it took for my mana to be born was much faster than others.”   “By that calculation, even if I had only used one Foundation Establishment Elixir, I could still have a chance to establish my foundation.”   “It’s just that the success rate was too low compared to the success rate after the full preparation. ”   “However, now that it’s come to this, breaking through the Foundation   Establishment is all that matters, and everything else is just minor details.”   “What’s really difficult is not having any cultivation skills for the Foundation Establishment Realm, as well as skills and tunneling skills for the Foundation   Establishment Realm.”   At this moment,   It was the time when the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect began to fight fiercely.   Foundation Establishment Masters entered the fray one after another, advancing from the Mountain Immortal City towards the territory of the Seven Star Sect.   At this time,   If he returned to the sect, claiming that he had broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage, he would definitely be rewarded by the Sect Leader, and perhaps even be given some good items.   At the same time, techniques, spells, and other things related to the Foundation Establishment Realm would be available for him to use.   However…   Enjoying these benefits would come at a price.   The cost would be that, within ten years, or even before ten years have passed, He Song would be sent to the battlefield by a transfer order to face and fight against the Foundation Establishment Masters of the Seven Star Sect. He Song did not want to fight.   As an everlasting being, he had no lifespan limit and could not, like other cultivators, fight to the death for an opportunity.   If he doesn’t fight, he definitely won’t die.   If he truly goes to fight, that’s when he will die.   Therefore.   This idea can only be abandoned.   But, if he doesn’t stay in the Thick Earth Sect, would he go to other sects nearby?   With his current identity as a Foundation Establishment Master, he would naturally be treated with respect if he went to other sects, just like Meng Guan, who had just broken through and was inducted into the sect.   However, He Song, who had already gained a foothold in the Thick Earth Sect, really didn’t want to give up his foundation in this place.   He Song had now firmly established himself in the Thick Earth Sect.   He had two Foundation Establishment Realm friends in the sect, and the Sect Leader had personally bestowed two Foundation Establishment Elixirs to help him succeed in the Foundation Establishment.   With such great momentum, how could he willingly give it up if he wasn’t forced into a desperate situation?   But when it comes to the point where he has to leave, He Song won’t hesitate.   But at this moment.   He still had some time to wait.    “Fortunately, I’m only fifty-six now, and there are still at least four years to wait.”   “For now, I’ll just retreat and cultivate in my cave mansion, and see if there will be a winner in the struggle between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect in these four years.”   “I don’t believe those two Golden Elixir Masters won’t make a move.” His gaze looked towards the direction of the Thick Earth Sect.   He Song made the decision to hide for four years, and immediately put the matter of going out to the back of his mind.   With four more years to go.   Not too long.   Not too short.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates   But luckily.   He had himself an opportunity during the Qi Refining stage.   Now that he had reached Foundation Establishment, it was time to see what exactlv was recorded in those two iade sliDS he had obtained from Mi Canc.   During He Song’s eighth-tier of Qi Refining, he once encountered an attempt on his life by a steward named Mi Cang from the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion while he was out to collect spirit rice.   Luckily, He Song had a backup plan and set up two Array Skills in a small valley.   With the help of the two arrays, Mi Cang died at the hands of He Song.   He Song searched several jade slips from Mi Cang’s storage bag.   Among these jade slips, there was the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill, a secret method that could increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment.   There were two other jade slips that He Song could not view due to his inadequate cultivation base and lack of divine sense. However, He Song had now reached Foundation Establishment.   His divine sense had been born.   Naturally, those two jade slips which he couldn’t view before should now be accessible.   After making the decision to temporarily wait for a few years in his cave mansion while watching the development of this great war, He Song naturally wouldn’t be idle.   With a thought.   Two jade slips appeared in front of He Song.   These two jade slips were the ones he had taken from Mi Cang, which he was unable to view during the Qi Refining stage.   Picking up one of the jade slips, He Song’s divine sense probed it, and immediately understood the contents.   At first, He Song was unable to read the jade slip in the Qi Refining stage, but once his divine sense probed it, it seemed as if he had broken through some sort of prohibition, and he easily read the information recorded in the jade slip.   “Blood Escape Skill”   This was a tunneling skill that could be used for traveling normally, and also for escaping in critical moments.   When not using essence blood as a catalyst and relying only on mana, it would function as a normal tunneling skill for traveling and such.   However, if one uses their own essence blood as a catalyst, it could explode with extreme speed in a short amount of time.   A cultivator who has learned this skill can rely on the sudden burst of extreme speed to escape their enemies’ pursuit.   At the same time, since it uses essence blood as a catalyst, the speed at which the Blood Escape Skill can explode during critical moments is much faster than ordinary escape tunneling skills.   Usually, opponents can’t react in time before the cultivator equipped with the Blood Escape Skill has vanished into the distance.   With such extreme speed, the price to pay is naturally not small.   Burning a drop of essence blood can maintain the tunneling skill for the time it takes to brew a cup of tea.   Although a cup of tea’s worth of time is enough to escape an enemy’s pursuit with the speed of the Blood Escape Skill, the consumption of a drop of essence blood is still painful for Foundation Establishment cultivators.   Ordinary cultivators possess only ten drops of essence blood.   If one has practiced body refining skills, they might have more essence blood, but not by much.   Recovering essence blood once it’s consumed is not easy.   Ordinary cultivators need years of hard work to recover it.   Even cultivators who have practiced body refining skills need at least a year to recover a single drop of essence blood by accelerating the condensation of essence blood with their body refining skills.   Given how precious essence blood is, it’s clear just how fast the Blood Escape Skill can be when for using the essence blood as a catalyst.   After examining the jade slip with his divine sense and obtaining all the methods of practicing and using the Blood Escape Skill, a glint flashed through He Song’s eyes.   He had just broken through the Foundation Establishment Realm.   It was the time when he had the least amount of skills at hand; if he encountered other Foundation Establishment cultivators, He Song, who had no Foundation Establishment skills, might not even be able to fight back..

Chapter 180 - 180 180: Arrow God Thorn But at the moment, he couldn’t enter the Thick Earth Sect and use contribution points to exchange for various skills in the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Therefore, when He Song saw the Blood Escape Skill in the jade slip, a weight was lifted off his chest.   With the Blood Escape Skill.   Once he practiced it to the point where he could use it freely without losing power:   Even if a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator attacked, he could escape using the Blood Escape Skill.   It only cost him a drop of essence blood.   He could recover in a few years.   For He Song, using a few years in exchange for a life was extremely cost-effective.   Thus, he didn’t need to worry about being discovered and killed.   Even if he didn’t have any means to contend with other Foundation Establishment Masters.   He had the Blood Escape Skill on him.   Ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators probably couldn’t do anything to him.   When his life was threatened, the Blood Escape Skill could help He Song turn danger into safety.   One could say that the appearance of the Blood Escape Skill significantly improved He Song’s safety.   If he couldn’t defeat them.   Was it impossible for him to escape?   With the Blood Escape Skill, He Song didn’t have to worry about not being able to escape.   Feeling slightly exhilarated, He Song put the jade slip containing the Blood Escape Skill back into his storage bag.            This was a good thing and had to be stored carefully.   After putting the jade slip of the Blood Escape Skill into the storage bag, He Song shifted his gaze to another jade slip.   This jade slip,   like the Blood Escape Skill, was also found in Mi Cang’s storage bag.   He didn’t know what was recorded inside.   With anticipation, He Song picked up the jade slip, and his divine sense probed within.   Arrow God Thorn.   Divine Sense Attack Skill.   The divine sense was condensed into arrow-shaped thorns and then released through a special method, inflicting massive damage on the opponent.   Under one strike, if the opponent was not severely damaged, they would suffer head dizziness, reduced battle power drastically.   If it was severe, blood flowed from all the orifices, and they would die immediately due to divine sense dissipation.   Generally speaking, divine sense attack skills were used when one’s cultivation was overwhelming the opponent.   Or, when one had taken many elixirs that could enhance divine sense and brought their divine sense above the same cultivation level cultivators.   Only by doing so could the above effects be achieved.   If the opponent’s divine sense was stronger, the one who would suffer divine sense shock, faint-headedness, substantial decrease in fighting power, or even blood flowing and divine sense disappearing, would be oneself.   One could say,   the Arrow God Thorn, this divine sense attack skill, was like a double-edged sword.   It could hurt others,   and also oneself.   In the hands of ordinary cultivators, it was a skill primarily used to bully juniors.            Foundation Establishment Masters could kill Qi Refining cultivators effortlessly using this technique.   With one strike, even a Qi Refining great perfection cultivator would die with blood flowing out of all orifices.   At the same time, unlike other skills that consumed mana, divine sense attack skills consumed divine sense.   Under unresisted conditions, the consumption of divine sense could be considered minimal.   Under such circumstances, as long as they faced a Qi Refining cultivator whose cultivation was lower, they couldn’t fight back without manifested divine sense.   A Foundation Establishment Master who had grasped the divine sense attack skill would undoubtedly be a born killer.   No matter how many Qi Refining cultivators were involved, as long as they had mastered this skill, they could kill one by one or two in pairs.   Using Artifacts consumed spirit power.   Using divine sense attack skills, facing Qi refining cultivators who had not even condensed divine sense, had virtually no cost.   In this way, He Song also had an overwhelming attack ability against Qi Refining cultivators.   “Arrow God Thorn, with my divine sense stronger than the average Foundation Establishment cultivator, this divine sense attack skill is perfect for me.”   “From now on, whether it is sneak attacks or escaping, I have one more tactic.”   “In a sneak attack, I can hit the enemy with the Arrow God Thorn beforehand, causing them to experience divine sense shock, dizziness, and a sharp decrease in fighting power.”   “Or else they might suffer from blood gushing from the orifices and die from divine sense dissipation.”   “When escaping, I can hit the enemy with an Arrow God Thorn, making them unable to chase.”   “Simply perfect!”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m   After imprinting the cultivation method and means of use of the Arrow God Thorn in his memory, He Song revealed a look of amazement. He would secretly list the Arrow God Thorn as a skill he must learn as soon as possible.   For He Song, this Arrow God Thorn was extremely powerful.   It was useful whether it was for sneak attacks or escaping.   In addition, if a Qi Refining cultivator tried to challenge He Song in the future, He Song would have the ability to strike them with a reduced dimension.   As soon as the Arrow God Thorn appeared, no matter how outstanding the opponent might be, as long as their cultivation was still in the Qi Refining stage and they had not produced divine sense, there was only death awaiting them.   After taking back the jade slip containing the Arrow God Thorn into his storage bag, He Song finally let out a long breath.   For the following four years.        

Chapter 181 - 181: 181: 3 Years Later Translator: 549690339   However, after Wei Fan went to the Mountain Immortal City, every time He Song saw him, he always asked when the Thick Earth Sect would attack, making He Song somewhat puzzled.   At the same time, he also felt that the recent order from the Golden Elixir Master was a bit unusual.   Besides that-   He didn’t say much more.   But when He Song read Meng Guan’s letter about the unusual behavior, a guess quickly flashed through his mind.   Sending Foundation Establishment Masters into the Seven Star Sect’s territory but not staying for long and leaving after appearing-   When done for the first time, it would undoubtedly put Foundation Establishment Masters in the Seven Star Sect on high alert.   Thinking that the Thick Earth Sect was about to launch a full-scale attack.   However, if this behavior continues for a while and the Thick Earth Sect side still does not take action, the Foundation Establishment Masters of the Seven Star Sect will probably get used to it.   Their alertness towards Thick Earth Sect’s Foundation Establishment Masters will significantly decrease.   Though not to the point of ignoring them, the drop in alertness is inevitable.   In such a state, if the Thick Earth Sect were suddenly to start a full-scale offensive one day, it would catch the Seven Star Sect off guard.   If it’s just Foundation Establishment Masters taking action together, they might manage to hold on.   But if there is a Golden Elixir Master taking action… the situation would be entirely different.   Could it be-   A Golden Elixir Master wants to take action to end this war?   Or are both Golden Elixir Masters going to intervene?   With various conjectures flashing through his mind, He Song looked towards the gate of the Thick Earth Sect, feeling that something significant was about to happen.   Perhaps-   He might really be able to return to the Thick Earth Sect in four years.   However, whether this will happenHe Song is not very sure.   After pondering for a long time, He Song eventually shook his head and dismissed the idea.   Thinking so much is meaningless; it’s better to wait quietly and see what will happen in these four years.   If he can return to the Thick Earth Sect, then he will go back.   If he cannot, he will leave the Thick Earth Sect’s territory and head to other sects’ location.   At this moment, he has become a Foundation Establishment Master.   No matter where he goes, he will be a distinguished guest of the sects and aristocratic families there.   He then replied to Meng Guan-   Telling him that he did not know why Wei Fan was unusually eager for battle and advised him to keep an eye on Wei Fan-   He Song soon entered the seclusive cultivation state and began practicing Blood Escape Skill and Arrow God Thorn.   Now-   He Song already knew the latest progress of the war between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect in Mountain Immortal City.   Although returning to the sect seems possible, He Song dared not rush back to the sect when things had not settled down.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m   Under these circumstances, learning the two foundational techniques he could study became the essential task for He Song.   Practicing the Blood Escape Skill was not difficult.   By expanding the Smoke Array’s coverage, covering a vast area within the Smoke Array’s range, and ensuring that he would not be discovered when practicing the Blood Escape Skill-   He Song soon began practicing the Blood Escape Skill.    He carefully memorized the key points of using the Blood Escape Skill, using mana to stimulate the skill, and transformed himself into tunneling light, flying in the sky.   At first, He Song could only fly in a straight line when using the skill.   But once he got the hang of it, He Song could control the tunneling light freely, increasing its speed and changing its direction in the sky.   At the same time, his technique for using mana to stimulate the Blood Escape Skill also improved, increasing his speed.   Normally, the mana consumed when using the Blood Escape Skill determines its speed.   If used at full power, the mana consumption will be rapid. Naturally, its speed will be extremely fast, giving it an advantage over general tunneling skills.   However, He Song had yet to try using essence blood as a guide to practice Blood Escape Skill.   Trying it would require years of recovery, so He Song was unwilling to do it unless his life was in danger.   At the same time-   When practicing the Blood Escape Skill, He Song discovered something else.   The color of tunneling light changed according to the attributes and mana of the cultivator.   The main difference between mana and spirit power is that mana can be controlled at will.   In other words-   As long as He Song wanted, his body’s mana could change into any attribute.   Metal, wood, water, fire, earth he could alter it to any attribute.   As a result-   After discovering this, He Song changed the color of his tunneling light to water-blue when he transformed into it.   Not because he liked this color-   But because the water-blue color was similar to the sky’s blue, making it the least noticeable color when flying in the sky using the tunneling light.   Perhaps his tunneling light’s water-blue color, similar to the blue sky, made others overlook it, thus avoiding some trouble?   After changing his tunneling light color to water-blue, mastering the Blood Escape Skill to the point where he could use it freely and without losing any speed, He Song nodded in satisfaction.   As for the practice of Arrow God Thorn-   The requirements for divine sense were quite high.   Arrow God Thorn was not about releasing one’s divine sense all at once to attack the enemy’s divine sense or soul.   Such an attack method didn’t involve any skill, and you could even say that everyone was capable of it.   The cultivation of Arrow God Thorn.   It was about using special techniques to gather one’s divine sense into a solid form, like an arrow shot in a condensed state, and instantly causing great damage to the enemy’s divine sense or soul.   It was like a stone dropped into a pond, the released divine sense would bring great shocks to the enemy’s divine sense or soul.   The soul or divine sense being suddenly impacted.   Of course, it would also cause a cultivator’s divine sense to fluctuate, making them dizzy and significantly reducing their combat power.   Those with weak souls or divine senses might even bleed from all seven orifices and die on the spot due to their divine sense being destroyed.   At the same time, the cultivation of Arrow God Thorn had high requirements for He Song’s own divine sense.   Fortunately, his divine sense was half stronger than that of an average cultivator at the same level, so he could practice it.   Just like that.   Time slowly passed.   He Song continued to cultivate Blood Escape Skill and Arrow God Thorn in his cave mansion.   In the blink of an eye.   Three years passed in an instant.   During these three years, the first skill He Song started to cultivate was Blood Escape Skill.    Blood Escape Skill was the best skill for He Song to rely on for survival, so naturally, it was the first he practiced.   Only after he could cast Blood Escape Skill freely without losing any speed would He Song start to cultivate Arrow God Thorn.   If he were to practice Arrow God Thorn first, and a Foundation Establishment Master discovered the location of He Song’s cave mansion and broke in, He Song, without any means of escape, would be defenseless.   For the sake of his own safety, He Song naturally knew which to choose first.   Cultivating Blood Escape Skill was quite simple.   It took He Song only a year and a half to completely master it, being able to cast it freely without losing any speed.   After that, He Song turned his focus onto Arrow God Thorn.   However,   In the remaining year and a half, during He Song’s Cultivation of Arrow God Thorn, he discovered that the cultivation difficulty of Arrow God Thorn was much higher than that of Blood Escape Skill.   He Song had never learned about divine sense attack skills before, so the speed at which he cultivated this skill was quite slow.   At the same time, Arrow God Thorn had strict requirements for a cultivator’s divine sense.   Although He Song’s divine sense met the criteria and could be used to cultivate Arrow God Thorn.   However, due to the fact that he was starting halfway, cultivating it was very difficult, making him furrow his brows.   Fortunately, He Song didn’t care too much about the passing of time.   Therefore, even today, a year and a half later, when Arrow God Thorn had not yet been cultivated to the point where it could be cast freely without losing its power, He Song had not given up.   The difficulty of Arrow God Thorn had taken He Song by surprise.   But even so, He Song continued to practice it daily, hoping to reach the point where he could cast it freely without losing its power. However, this goal seemed to be still a little far at present.   But,   From the day He Song broke through to Foundation Establishment to today, a full three years had passed.   In these three years,   Although He Song had been in seclusive cultivation for Blood Escape Skill and Arrow God Thorn, he was well aware of the outside world.   Three years ago,   When He Song broke through to Foundation Establishment, he had communicated with Meng Guan, and learned of the speculation that there would be major actions in the Thick Earth Sect.   Things did not go beyond He Song’s expectations.   One year ago, two years after He Song’s Foundation Establishment, Master Yan Shan and Master Fa Xuan of the Thick Earth Sect quietly took action.   After opening the Sect Protection Array of the Thick Earth Sect to ensure their supply route was not cut off,   The two Masters joined forces and launched an attack on the defensive line of the Seven Star Sect with great force.   The powerful strength of the Golden Elixir Masters was fully displayed at that moment.   Although He Song did not witness it personally,   From Meng Guan’s and Wei Fan’s descriptions, he could feel the shock they had witnessed first-hand.   That level of power was far greater than that of the Foundation Establishment Masters!   The Foundation Establishment Masters of the Seven Star Sect fell one by one, like wheat being cut, and the sky was filled with blood mist, with bloodshed and carnage everywhere.   In that strike, the Thick Earth Sect emerged victorious.   If it weren’t for the timely appearance of the Sect Leader of the Seven Star Sect, Master Tian Shu, who single-handedly held back Master Yan Shan and Master Fa Xuan, the Seven Star Sect’s Foundation Establishment Masters would have suffered even heavier losses.   Nevertheless,   Masters Yan Shan and Fa Xuan still managed to lead the Foundation Establishment Masters of the Thick Earth Sect, pushing the battlefront all the way from the Mountain Immortal City, where the two sects bordered, to the foot of the Seven Star Sect’s mountains.   Master Tian Shu, the Sect Leader of the Seven Star Sect, was also injured and forced to retreat due to holding back two Masters of the same level.   From then on, the Seven Star Sect activated its Sect Protection Array, and all Foundation Establishment Masters retreated to the protection of the array, trapped within the Sect’s mountain gates.   Seeing this, the two Masters of the Thick Earth Sect did not press the attack.   Instead, they began to take control of the Seven Star Sect’s territory with their Foundation Establishment Masters.   Meanwhile, after the Seven Star Sect had been trapped within their mountain gates, the Thick Earth Sect closed its temporarily opened Sect Protection Array.   The Sect Protection Array was one of the strongest foundations of almost all sects.   Once the Sect Protection Array was activated, the resources consumed would undoubtedly be enormous..

Chapter 182 - 182: 182: Foundation Establishment Failure Translator: 549690339   In such circumstances, the defense and offensive capabilities of the Sect Protection Array were naturally second to none.   When there is no threat, the Thick Earth Sect’s Sect Protection Array would not remain activated all the time.   The two Golden Elixir Masters of Thick Earth Sect didn’t pay much attention to the Sect Protection Array of the Seven Star Sect.   Forcing a Sect Protection Array requires a massive amount of resources and manpower.   Such a feat would also be practically impossible to achieve in a short span of time.   Instead, while the Seven Star Sect’s Sect Protection Array is activated, it was better to gain control over all the forces within the influence of the Seven Star Sect, turning the mountain gate of the Seven Star Sect into an isolated island.   Perhaps, when the Seven Star Sect could no longer sustain the terrifying consumption of the Sect Protection Array and would have to shut it down, they would find their forces to have been completely taken over by the Thick Earth Sect once they stepped out of their gate.   Even then, if they couldn’t find a solution, the Seven Star Sect might even risk expulsion by the two Golden Elixir Masters from the Thick Earth Sect.   By then, Master Tian Shu of the Seven Star Sect would probably be spitting blood.   Presently.   It has been three years since He Song broke through to Foundation Establishment.   This year, the Sect Protection Array of the Seven Star Sect was still active.   Meanwhile, the Foundation Establishment Masters and Golden Elixir Masters of the Thick Earth Sect were happily claiming territory within the influence of the Seven Star Sect.   Almost every Foundation Establishment Master had their pockets full of cultivation resources and various treasures.   A Sect War.   It was as dangerous as it was opportunistic.   Victory meant wealth, as the Foundation Establishment Masters of the Thick Earth Sect were currently enjoying.   Defeat would result in death, such as the fate of those Foundation Establishment Masters of the Seven Star Sect.   The reason He Song did not want to get involved in the Sect War was obviously due to concern for his own safety.   He would rather not acquire an opportunity this way.   Nor was he inclined to take part in a Sect War with such a high-risk factor.   At the same time.   Knowing that the two Golden Elixir Masters from within his sect had blatantly attacked all the way to the foot of the Seven Star Sect’s mountain gate, He Song did not rush back to his sect.   Instead, after getting this news, he further accelerated his practice with the Arrow God Thorn.   But just three years after He Song’s Foundation Establishment, while he was practicing the Arrow God Thorn.   The Sound Transmission Amulet in front of him started to glow again.   Upon seeing this, He Song quickly stopped his practice of the Arrow God Thorn and picked up the Sound Transmission Amulet.   Taking a thin piece of paper from the amulet, he glanced over it.   “Mr. He, Shuangshuang failed to establish her foundation two years ago, but she has recovered from her injuries and is about to be assigned elsewhere.”   “Before leaving, she remembered the gift you gave in Green Wall Immortal City and asked to meet you one last time to show her gratitude.”   “Ping’er.”   Reading the lines on the paper, He Song raised an eyebrow.   Ping’er’s older sister?   Chu Shuangshuang?   Chu Shuangshuang’s Establishment Foundation failed?   With a distant look in his eyes, He Song looked towards the direction of the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate and sighed softly.   Thinking back when.   When he had just arrived in this world.   He met his new friends, Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   Right after that, he met Ping’er on their way to the Spirit Skill Pavilion in the Immortal Pavilion.   From that time on, Ping’er was already acquainted with Chu Shuangshuang.            Later with Chu Shuangshuang’s help, Ping’er successfully became a disciple of Master Qingyue.   Thus, Ping’er’s status changed from a minor cultivator of the Immortal Pavilion to a disciple of a True Master in the Thick Earth Sect.   This status change was undoubtedly huge.   And by a stroke of luck, he also got acquainted with Chu Shuangshuang.   Although their relationship wasn’t close and there were no romantic feelings involved, they could still be considered acquaintances.   Now Chu Shuangshuang had failed in her Foundation Establishment, had recovered from her injuries, and was going to be assigned elsewhere. It was unlikely they would meet again.   Before she left, Chu Shuangshuang remembered that he once gifted her and both Ping’er and Master Qingyue, thus wanting to thank him in person seemed reasonable.   However…   He glanced over the quiet room he was in.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com   A helpless look flashed through He Song’s face.   Now, he himself had already established his foundation.   If he were to return to the sect now, his presence would immediately be detected by the Foundation Establishment Masters in the sect.   The appearance of a new Foundation Establishment Master would undeniably attract a lot of attention.   And what’s more, going to see someone who’s just failed in their Foundation Establishment, as a newly appointed Foundation Establishment Master… isn’t that a bit too cruel?   Of course, the most important thing was that if he returned to the sect now, it would clash with He Song’s plan.   According to his plan,   He needed to return to the sect a few days, or perhaps half a month, before his sixtieth birthday.   That way, he could give others the illusion that his Foundation Establishment was a mere stroke of luck.   As such, he would be seen as just another average cultivator who managed to establish his foundation by luck.   Not as someone who shone brilliantly right from the start.   Only then could He Song blend in within the Thick Earth Sect, steadily increasing his strength inconspicuously.   Consequently,   Since Chu Shuangshuang has now recovered from her failed Foundation Establishment and is about to be stationed elsewhere, her wish to meet him one last time seems unlikelv to come true.   This matter may not be viable.   He shook his head.   He Song casually took out a thin piece of paper, let his spiritual power flow from his fingertips, leaving lines of characters on the paper.   “Unfortunately, I failed in my attempt to build my foundation a year ago, and I am now healing in a secluded place, unable to return to the sect to see Sister Shuangshuang.”   “I am now fifty-nine, and if I cannot breakthrough the Foundation   Establishment before sixty, I’m afraid there’s no hope for me in this lifetime.”   “I believe Sister Shuangshuang will understand that whether I succeed in building a foundation or not this time, I will personally visit her.”   “I hope Ping’er will speak a few kind words for me.”   “He Song.”   After doing all this, He Song put the paper into the Sound Transmission Amulet, as his spiritual power was released, the paper disappeared instantly.   Seeing this situation, He Song sighed, feeling the irony of fate.   Chu Shuangshuang.   As Ping’er and He Song chatted casually.   She only had the talent of a four spirits root.   The reason she was able to become a disciple of Master Qingyue was that she was related to her.   So she was able to enter the Thick Earth Sect and become a disciple of a master.   The pity is…   Despite all this, because of her own limitations and bad luck, she ultimately failed to cross the difficult road of Foundation Establishment.   Even as a disciple of Thick Earth Sect, the first disciple of a Foundation Establishment master, she ended up like this.   This shows how difficult Foundation Establishment is.            It’s as hard as scaling the heavens.   For ordinary Loose cultivators, the road to Foundation Establishment is much more difficult than for disciples of the sect.   Sect’s disciples consider building foundations must be fully prepared, and there is still a high chance of failure.   For Ordinary Loose cultivators, even if they have made what they consider to be full preparation, their success rate is incomparable to a sect’s disciples.   Sect’s disciples have Foundation Establishment Elixirs and teachings on Foundation Establishment.   What do Loose cultivators have?   With this in mind, He Song couldn’t help but sigh, Meng Guan is indeed lucky.   After replying to Ping’er’s letter.   Images of his acquaintance with Chu Shuangshuang flashed through He Song’s mind, making him feel extremely depressed.   He knew that such things would inevitably occur frequently in the future.   He should get used to it.   But the more he thought about it, the more obvious the frustration in his heart became.   Out of helplessness…   He Song opened the door of his meditation room, went outside the cave mansion to enjoy the scenery and clear his mind.   At least, he should dispel his gloom before he trains with the Arrow God Thorn.   Moreover, it also allowed him to gradually get used to the feeling of familiar faces gradually being left behind, while he would keep moving forward.   As an everlasting being…   He Song was bound to face such situations in the future.   It is better to face it directly than to avoid it. Having experienced a lot, his immunity to such things would naturally be higher.   Perhaps in the future, when such things happen again, He Song will remain calm, with only a sigh in his heart.   However…   Just as He Song came out of his meditation and was about to clear his mind…   The moment he stepped out of the meditation room, he saw two sound-transmitting paper cranes appearing in front of him.   He Song had been in seclusive cultivation for a while, and when people wanted to find him, they mainly communicated via Sound Transmission Amulet, so He Song had not seen sound-transmitting paper cranes for quite some time.   Seeing two sound -transmitting paper cranes outside his meditation room, He Song was taken aback for a moment, then he released his aura and took the two pieces of thin paper.   “How have you been doing recently, my friend? I unfortunately failed in my   Foundation Establishment but survived thanks to a Vein Protection Elixir.”   “I no longer wish to stay in Green Wall Immortal City.”   “Years have been wasted, and all for naught in the end.”   “Now that I’m over sixty, it’s time for me to find a spouse, have a child or two to pass on my mantle.”   “If you need me in the future, you can find me at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.”   “We both started our Immortal Path from here, it’s hard to forget.”   “I am here, waiting for your visit.”   “Lin Cong.”   After scanning the writing on the paper, He Song’s gaze lingered on the name Lin Cong for a long time.   If his memory served him…   Decades ago, when he first came to this world, his first neighbor was Lin Cong, wasn’t it?   Lin Cong back then…   Brimming with youthful vigor.   Built like a tank.   His eyes carried a killing intent.   Bulky muscles all over his body.   He exuded a fierce aura.   Added to this, his cultivation was much higher than He Song’s at that time, his spiritual pressure was quite intimidating.   The impression Lin Cong made on He Song when they first met was deep and lasting.   But after the great disaster at the Immortal Pavilion, Lin Cong left at He Song’s suggestion and went to the Green Wall Immortal City to settle down.   It wasn’t until He Song joined the Thick Earth Sect and went to deliver gifts on behalf of Master Qingyue at the Green Wall Immortal City that they met again..        

Chapter 183 - 183: 183: Successful Foundation Establishment Translator: 549690339   And from that meeting, until today, the two hadn’t seen each other again.   Looking at it now.   Lin Cong seemed to be living a good life in Green Wall Immortal City.   To have an opportunity to establish a foundation before the age of sixty as a loose cultivator, Lin Cong’s strength probably wasn’t too weak.   However… even so, Lin Cong, who was still burly in He Song’s memory, still fell short of overcoming the obstacle of Foundation Establishment.   It made He Song feel very emotional and saddened.   Back then.   When He Song had just met Lin Cong, he had been constantly on guard against Lin Cong, fearing that Lin Cong would suddenly become violent and hurt others.   To this end, he even exposed that he had a Qi-refining late stage cultivator as his supporter.   Only then did Lin Cong feel wary, and began to try to befriend He Song   Thus, the relationship between the two improved with the passage of time.   After spending a few years together, the two would call each other good friends. During Lin Cong’s breakthrough to the Qi-refining mid-stage, the two even dined happily together at the Osmanthus Pavilion in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   However, all of this was in the past.   Today’s He Song was now a Foundation Establishment cultivator, with a long Immortal Path ahead of him.   But now, Lin Cong had failed to establish his foundation and was preparing to return to Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to live out his remaining years.   Between the two of them.   The gap in their statuses had grown wider and wider.   Perhaps, by the time He Song sees Lin Cong again, Lin Cong would have been old and frail?   Sighing, he put the paper in his storage bag.   He Song didn’t hurry to reply, instead he looked at another piece of paper.   “Mr. He, it has been more than a decade since we last met at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, how have you been lately?”   “I was fortunate to have obtained a Foundation Establishment Elixir in Green Wall Immortal City a few days ago.”   “I shamelessly sought advice from Brother Meng on the experience of building the foundation. ”   “Now that I’ve successfully established my foundation, I’ll head to Thick Earth   Sect’s main entrance.”   “By then, you and I will be fellow disciples.” “In the future, we should visit each other more often.”   “Zhao Lin.”   As his eyes scanned the lines of writing on the paper, He Song’s mind immediately conjured up the image of Zhao Lin.   Zhao Lin.   He was a connection that Meng Guan had handed over to He Song before heading to the Red Spirit Gold Mine.   His relationship with Meng Guan had been very good initially.   However, afterwards, when Meng Guan went to the Red Spirit Gold Mine, their relationship gradually faded.   As a result, when He Song was brought into the Thick Earth Sect by Meng Guan, Zhao Lin stayed in the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Meng Guan seemed to have forgotten him.   Or had thought of him but didn’t mention him.   He Song had never asked, so he didn’t know the reason.   Zhao Lin and He Song could be considered friends. When thev were in Bamboo   Mountain Immortal Pavilion, Zhao Lin had helped He Song more than once by using his authority to secure benefits for him.   Therefore, when He Song saw Zhao Lin mentioning that he had managed to obtain a Foundation Establishment Elixir and asked Meng Guan for advice on the experience of building the foundation, He Song was not surprised.   Zhao Lin was an amulet Tao master.   Moreover, he was an experienced amulet master who could draw many spirit amulets and naturally earn a lot of spirit stones using those amulets.   Under such circumstances.   He Song had long assumed that Zhao Lin would have a certain chance of establishing his foundation.   At the same time, he had also guessed that Zhao Lin would be able to obtain a Foundation Establishment Elixir.   Amulet masters also earned a lot of spirit stones.   Although they couldn’t compare with He Song’s array tao, a master like Zhao Lin, who had been studying Amulet Tao since his humble beginnings, wouldn’t be too slow in earning spirit stones.   By the age of sixty, gathering tens of thousands of spirit stones would be difficult, but He Song thought it was not impossible, according to his calculations.   A Foundation Establishment Elixir had appeared in Green Wall Immortal City.   According to He Song’s estimation, one would probably cost tens of thousands of spirit stones.   With Zhao Lin’s wealth, if he were to exhaust his savings, he might be able to bid for it,   With good luck, perhaps he could really win the bid.   Of course.   Outside Thick Earth Sect,    Every time a Foundation Establishment Elixir appeared, it would cause a stir.   What exactly Zhao Lin did during the appearance of this Foundation Establishment Elixir and how he obtained it, He Song didn’t know all these details.   In Zhao Lin’s letter, he only mentioned the result.   As for the process, he didn’t mention a word.   He Song couldn’t even guess.   However… He Song hadn’t expected.   With just one Foundation Establishment Elixir.   And a piece of advice on building the foundation,   That Zhao Lin would indeed succeed in building the foundation.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com   These conditions.   Although they were much, much better than when Meng Guan built his foundation.   Even so, such a foundation-building condition could be comparable to some thick Earth Sect outer disciples.   But when Zhao Lin truly claimed he had successfully established his foundation, He Song still felt a little surprised.   Frowning and pondering for a moment.   He Song finally decided to send a sound-transmitting paper crane to both individuals.   He stated that he was currently healing from injuries after seclusive cultivation,   And that when he was free later, he would definitely visit them in person and such.   After doing all this, He Song stepped out of the meditation chamber, and soon began to wander around his cave mansion under the cover of Smoke Array.   Now.   He Song was already fifty-nine years old.   Given He Song’s usual cultivation speed, he would definitely be able to reach Qi Refining great perfection before the age of fifty-eight.   This knowledge could be easily gathered by calculating the time.   Therefore, He Song could only declare to the outside world that he had failed his first attempt at advancement and was now recovering from his injuries.   But besides He Song,   No one knew.   That he had already successfully broken through to Qi Refining Great Perfection at the age of fifty-six, and with the help of six Foundation Establishment Elixirs, several pieces of Foundation Establishment advice, as well as the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill, he successfully built the foundation.   During the three years since he had broken through to Foundation Establishment,   He had also learned the Blood Escape Skill and was currently studying a Divine Sense Attack Skill called Arrow God Thorn.   At this moment, He Song.   Was truly a Foundation Establishment Master!   Only the outside world knew.   At fifty-eight, He Song failed in his first attempt at Foundation Establishment.   Now, he was in a two-year period of recuperation.   Even the prospect of He Song being able to establish the foundation before sixty was pessimistic.   After all, even Chu Shuangshuang had failed in Foundation Establishment, and He Song, a sect disciple who later joined, naturally had a low rate of success.   He Song hid like this because he wanted to achieve this effect.   Only in this way.   When he establishes the foundation, it won’t attract too much attention.   Everyone will think that He Song is just lucky to have established the foundation, and that’s the result of good luck.   But what they didn’t know was.   How He Song could come this far.   It was entirely different from what they thought.   To come this far, He Song relied on, not luck at all.   But his own strength!   Going to the Medicine Garden.   Fiddling with spirit medicine.   Arriving at the spirit field.   Tending to the spirit field.   Passing by the riverside.   Looking at the egg he picked up three years ago.   Three years ago.   In the eve of He Song’s Foundation Establishment, he picked up an egg with a trace of spirit Qi from the riverside.   In these three years.   He Song didn’t really care about the egg anymore, and after breaking through the Foundation Establishment, he brought it back from a remote corner several dozen miles away.   And then it was always thrown by He Song on the riverside, living or dying.   However.    Three years have passed, and the egg that He Song picked up is still just an egg.   Crystal clear, with a shadow inside.   When observed with the Spirit Vision Skill, it still contained traces of spirit Qi.   It’s been three years.   The egg never broke, nor did it hatch anything.   If it wasn’t for the increasingly noticeable life aura in the egg, He Song estimated that the egg would have gone bad.   However, after three years, the egg remained unbroken and didn’t hatch anything.   This also made He Song a bit puzzled.   This egg… doesn’t seem to be a mortal thing?   What kind of egg can be thrown by the river and stay fresh for three years?   The key is that after three years, the life aura inside has become stronger and stronger.   Did he get lucky and pick up a treasure?   After playing with the egg in his hands carefully, He Song could not figure it out.   The spirit Qi contained in the egg was just like that, very thin.   He Song certainly wouldn’t believe that the egg was some kind of mysterious bird like a phoenix, Suzaku, or a real dragon.   There is too little spirit Qi inside the egg.   But to say it’s a mortal thing, it contains a little spirit Qi, and at the same time, it remains active for a long time.   Looking at it this way, the egg doesn’t look like a mortal thing.   After playing with it for a while.   He Song thought, and decided to bring the egg back to his cave mansion.   Now.   He Song’s Foundation Establishment is complete.   Even if something strange were to hatch from the egg.   He should be able to handle it.   This egg.   Perhaps it was thrown by the river, and the temperature was not suitable, so it couldn’t hatch for three years.   If he puts the egg in a suitable temperature, it should be able to hatch.   With this thought in mind, He Song began hatching the egg for several days.   At the same time.   He can also use this time to completely calm his emotions.   A few days later.   Maybe it was because of the suitable temperature.   The egg, which hadn’t hatched anything for three years, suddenly cracked at this moment.   He Song glanced at it.   He saw a small tortoise crawl out of the eggshell and look around.   A glint of brilliance flashed in his eyes.   He Song quickly discovered that the little turtle’s body contained traces of spirit Qi.   It appeared.   It was a spirit beast.   Moreover.   Turtle-type spirit beasts had long lifespans and preferred peace to movement, and they were excellent for watching over the house.   As long as this little tortoise is controlled with a Beast Mastery Token, he could have his first spirit beast in his life.   It’s just… this turtle doesn’t really suit his Foundation Establishment Master’s identity.   It seems that he could only use it to watch over the house and couldn’t show it to others in the same way.   With this thought flashing through his mind.   He Song quickly made up his mind to go catch a good-looking spirit beast to serve as his mount.   As for this turtle.   He can use it to watch over the house.   After all, he had spent several days hatching it, and it wouldn’t be right to ignore it now.   Now that He Song has adjusted his mentality after several days, he even has the idea of keeping this turtle to watch over the house.   After making the decision.   He Song casually got some food for the newly hatched tortoise.   Then he entered the quiet room again, and began to practice the Arrow God Thorn.   Raising a little turtle.   Normally, He Song doesn’t need to take care of it too much.   Just feed it when he remembers to, or let it outside the cave mansion to forage for food within the Smoke Array.   Economical.   That was also one of the reasons He Song kept it.   If He Song were to go into seclusion for three or five years, this spirit beast turtle would probably not starve to death..

Chapter 184 - 184: 184: A Year Later Translator: 549690339   Just like that.   Another year passed in the blink of an eye.   During this year.   He Song became more and more proficient in the Arrow God Thorn. In the end, he even managed to practice it to the point where he could use it casually without losing any of its power.   Indeed, the cultivation of the Arrow God Thorn was quite difficult.   Counting the time.   It took He Song a full two and a half years to finally master the Arrow God Thorn to the point where he could use it casually without losing any of its power.   According to He Song’s original estimate, he would only need about two years to cultivate various techniques of the Foundation Establishment Realm after reaching it.   For simpler ones, such as the Blood Escape Skill, it would only take a year and a half.   However, it took He Song a full two and a half years to completely master the Arrow God Thorn.   From this, it seems that the difficulty of cultivating the Arrow God Thorn is more challenging than other techniques of the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Moreover.   The two and a half years were only because He Song cultivated skills faster than other cultivators, so it took only two and a half years.   After completely mastering the Arrow God Thorn, He Song could use it easily without losing any of its power, so he finally relaxed and left his quiet room.   However, as soon as He Song stepped out of the quiet room, he saw a palm-sized turtle on the ground outside the door, lying on its back with all four feet in the air, as if it was accusing him of negligence.   Upon seeing this.   He Song beckoned, and mana rushed out from his body, lifting the little turtle on the ground and placing it on his hands.   After taking a closer look.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com   He Song came to a conclusion.   It was not dead.   It was okay.   He put down the little turtle, threw some food to it, and then walked into the tea room.   He brewed himself a pot of hot tea.   With the fragrance of the tea filling the room, He Song picked up the tea cup and took a gentle sip.   Noticing that there was a tiny increase in his mana after swallowing the tea, He Song’s eyes flashed with dissatisfaction.   This tea was highly effective for Qi Refining cultivators.   But for Foundation Establishment cultivators, it could only be said to be slightly helpful at best.   The increase in his cultivation was too minimal.   It seemed he would have to change the tea he drank daily to spirit tea suitable for the Foundation Establishment Realm.   With this thought in mind, He Song quickly calculated his age and found that he was very close to his sixtieth year.   There was just a little over half a month before he would turn sixty.   Seeing this, he thought for a moment before taking out a thin piece of paper, pouring his spirit power into it, and writing several lines of text on it.   “Fellow daoist, I am approaching the age of sixty, and two years ago, I failed in my Foundation Establishment. It is affecting my dao heart.”   “Currently, I have left the sect to search for an opportunity to break through while also trying to make up for the deficiencies in my dao heart.” “If successful, I will return to the sect with good news.”   “If not, I will return to the sect after recovering from my injuries to serve at the sect’s disposal.” “Do not worry.”   “He Song.”   After deliberating on his words, He Song came up with a reason for attempting to break through his Foundation Establishment stage outside the sect.   Furthermore, he left a reassuring message, stating that if successful, he would return to the sect with good news, and if not, he would serve at the sect’s disposal after recovering from his injuries.    Thus.   Even if He Song were to break through his Foundation Establishment stage outside the sect, no one would suspect anything upon reading this letter. For this was a message He Song sent to his good friends within the sect.   Nobody would think that he was lying after reading this.   After all, who knew that He Song had actually broken through the Foundation Establishment Realm long ago, and had been acting years ahead of time?   In others’ eyes, He Song had no reason or motive for fabricating his story.   With two Foundation Establishment Elixirs and two Foundation Establishment Realm Master friends in the sect, why would he need to lie?   Wasn’t it normal to no longer be confident after failing in their first Foundation Establishment attemDt, which affected their dao heart?   Wasn’t it also normal to try to mend their dao heart outside the sect before attempting the Foundation Establishment again?   And when the day came that He Song returned to the sect as a Foundation Establishment Master.   The existence of this Sound Transmission Amulet would serve as proof of the authenticity of his written words.   By then.   No one would question why He Song wanted to leave the sect to establish his foundation.   They would only sigh, thinking how lucky He Song was to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm when he was about to turn sixty.   The existence of this Sound Transmission Amulet was just one layer of insurance that He Song had in place for his plan to break through Foundation Establishment outside the sect.   After making several copies of the text on the thin paper.   He sent them to Meng Guan, Wei Fan, Ping’er, and Zhao Lin, respectively.   He Song soon received their replies.   In their responses.   Meng Guan, Wei Fan, Ping’er, and Zhao Lin all expressed their understanding of He Song’s decision and wished him success in his Foundation Establishment.   They also each expressed regret that they couldn’t be there to guard him during the process.   Seeing this, He Song didn’t engage in further communication with them.   The more they talked, the more they might give away.   After thinking about it, He Song quickly looked in the direction of Green Wall Immortal City.   If he were to mend his dao heart.   I’m afraid I have to go to Green Wall Immortal City myself.   Head to Green Wall Immortal City using the Breath Concealment Formulas.   As long as he doesn’t encounter other Foundation Establishment Realm Masters, He Song can hide his cultivation.   But if he’s in the Thick Earth Sect… it might not be so easy to hide.   That’s because there are Foundation Establishment Realm Masters guarding the sect and a Golden Elixir Master in charge.   He Song is not sure if the Breath Concealment Formulas can deceive a Golden Elixir Master.   Even for a Foundation Establishment Realm Master, He Song can only guarantee that they won’t sense his Foundation Establishment Realm aura if they don’t meet face-to-face.   But if he encounters them directly, they might see through him at a glance.   Therefore, He Song needs to infiltrate Green Wall Immortal City using the Breath Concealment Formulas.   Then, in his temporary residence, he needs to set up a small Spirit-Gathering Array and manually operate it to extract the surrounding spirit Qi.   Create a small Qi vortex.   It doesn’t need to be big.   Just like when Meng Guan broke through before, a not too big or too small Qi vortex is enough.   In this case, He Song just needs to sit in the quiet room, release his divine sense to cover the room, and wait for the situation to develop.   If a strange divine sense comes to investigate,   as soon as their divine senses touch, the strange divine sense will confirm that someone is breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm within Green Wall Immortal City.    Only after He Song’s breakthrough is over will they personally visit him.   Just like when Meng Guan broke through, and Master Qingy Yue came personally.   In this way,   the news of He Song consolidating his Dao heart and breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in Green Wall Immortal City will immediately spread.   His words and actions will then verify each other.   Even if some people in the Thick Earth Sect are suspicious, after learning about this matter, they probably won’t doubt He Song’s breakthrough outside the sect too much.   After all, although his breakthrough isn’t within the sect, it’s still within Immortal City.   The Foundation Establishment Realm Master who comes to see He Song in Immortal City can testify for him.   So, naturally no one will have doubts about He Song’s breakthrough outside the sect anymore.   By the time He Song achieves Foundation Establishment and returns to the sect, the treatment he receives shouldn’t be affected either. He Song has been a member of the Thick Earth Sect for over ten years.   All these years, he’s been within the sect.   Now that he’s reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, it’s a great joyous event for the sect disciples who have also succeeded in their breakthrough.   Moreover,   with the different status of Foundation Establishment Realm Masters, even if someone is suspicious, they will not have any objections as long as He Song has returned to the Thick Earth Sect.   He Song, Wei Fan, and Meng Guan are a formidable force when they band together as Foundation Establishment Realm Masters.   Thus, He Song does not need to worry about his breakthrough outside the sect being questioned by others anymore.   After planning everything,   He Song stayed in his cave mansion for another two days.   He finally got up and left his cave mansion.   He used the Breath Concealment Formulas and the Earth Tunneling Skill all the way.   He Song’s figure quickly arrived outside Green Wall Immortal City.   Although he was delayed for two days, his speed was much faster than when he was at the Qi Refining great perfection stage.   At this rate, calculating the time it takes for him to travel from the Thick Earth Sect to Green Wall Immortal City at the speed of Qi Refining great perfection, He Song should be arriving at the city.   This timing is what He Song had calculated.   Upon entering Green Wall Immortal City, He Song quickly rented a room in an inn in the west of the city using some spirit stones.   From this point, the first half of He Song’s plan began. In the inn,   He Song waited for several days.   Until one day,   He Song was sitting on a cushion with a small Spirit-Gathering Array set up by his side.   At the same time, he absorbed the spirit Qi himself, causing the spirit Qi to gather continuously from all directions.   After a small Qi vortex formed in mid- air,   He Song timely released his divine sense, covering the entire room within the range of his perception.   Having done all of this,   He Song checked the Qi vortex that had appeared above the inn with his divine sense, and nodded secretly in his heart.   The Qi vortex was just the right size, almost indistinguishable from when Meng Guan had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.   In this state, it should quickly attract the attention of others.   At the same time, the Foundation Establishment Realm Masters within Green Wall Immortal City would likely come to investigate soon.   When that happens, the moment He Song’s divine sense touches the other party, his plan will be halfway successful. The next step, is to wait quietly.   A Qi vortex had appeared above an inn in Green Wall Immortal City.   This sight immediately shocked all the cultivators in the city who had observed it.   Everyone knows,   to cause a Qi vortex in a place as rich with spirit Qi as Green Wall Immortal   City,   either someone breaks through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and is currently consolidating their cultivation, or a Golden Elixir Realm Master is cultivating here to cause such a big commotion..

185  Chapter 185: A Step to the Sky   Golden Elixir Masters are a rare sight for most cultivators, so naturally, they would not believe that one would appear here.   As such, the only explanation is that someone within the inn had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, becoming a genuine Foundation Establishment cultivator.   In a short while.   A large number of cultivators began to converge at the inn where He Song was staying.   It seemed as if they all wanted a piece of the good fortune that accompanied He Song's breakthrough.   At the same time, the inn's owner was extremely delighted at this moment.   Someone had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in his inn!   In the future, his inn could even be renamed the Heaven Ascending Inn!   For ordinary cultivators, reaching Foundation Establishment was like ascending to the heavens in one step.   Someone successfully reaching Foundation Establishment in his inn was like a golden signboard!   A fitting name: Heaven Ascending Inn!   Meanwhile.   As countless cultivators flocked to the inn,   He Song detected a strange divine sense approaching this place.   But before it could come into contact with He Song's divine sense, a message was already passed along.   "Fellow cultivator, rest assured in consolidating your cultivation. I am Master Qingyue of the Thick Earth Sect; with me here, no one can disturb your cultivation."   As the message arrived, Qingyue's divine sense withdrew as well.   As He Song had deployed the Breath Concealment Formulas, he didn't reveal a shred of his aura.   As a result, Master Qingyue had no idea that the person 'breaking through' in the inn was someone she knew.   Inside the inn.   He Song quickly realized that someone had suppressed the disturbance outside.   Sensing the calming atmosphere outside the inn,   He Song's expression became rather peculiar.   Master Qingyue?   Was Master Qingyue still performing her duty as the guardian of Green Wall Immortal City like before?   What kind of expression would she have if she knew the person 'breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm' in the inn was herself?   It was known that.   This woman used to not think much of He Song.   The rare occasions when she smiled were merely out of courtesy given Meng Guan and Wei Fan, who were also Foundation Establishment Masters.   At other times, for Qi Refining cultivators like He Song,   She didn't even spare them a second glance.   Even when her gaze passed over him, she never paused.   It was only because He Song had gotten acquainted with her two disciples and personally delivered gifts that she had any impression of him at all.   As for anything else?   It was definitely not there.   And now.   From the message Master Qingyue had sent using her divine sense, her attitude towards this 'stranger' Foundation Establishment cultivator was far more amicable.   Seated on the meditation cushion, He Song controlled the small Spirit-Gathering Array to absorb spirit Qi from the outside world while also increasing his own absorption speed to the max.   In mid-air, the not too big, not too small spirit Qi vortex was firmly maintained.   However.   When the image of Master Qingyue's face crossed his mind, He Song's eyes became even more peculiar.   He was really curious.   What kind of expression would Master Qingyue have when she personally came to visit him only to discover that the cultivator 'breaking through' in the inn was He Song?   It should be.   Quite amusing, right?   ...   Several days later.   He Song dismantled the small Spirit-Gathering Array.   And he also stopped absorbing any more spirit Qi from the outside world.    The vortex of spirit Qi above the inn gradually dissipated as He Song ceased his actions.   For this time.   He Song had planned carefully.   For when Meng Guan had broken through to Foundation Establishment, the spirit Qi vortex in mid-air had taken several days to dissipate as well.   Since He Song was going through this process, it would naturally take several days for the spirit Qi vortex to disappear.   As such.   When the spirit Qi vortex had completely dispersed,   He Song instantly retracted his divine sense and put on an excited expression as though he had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Then, he began to quietly wait while seated on his meditation cushion.   Through Meng Guan's Foundation Establishment experience, He Song knew very well   that Master Qingyue would soon arrive here, intending to win him over to join the Thick Earth Sect.   However... he was already a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, and Master Qingyue's plan to make a big profit from this situation would fall through.   The reason why he chose to 'break through' to the Foundation Establishment Realm in Green Wall Immortal City was to find someone who could testify on his behalf.   As for the rewards, he could just go back to the sect and ask the Sect Leader for them.   There was no need to rely on others.   As the spirit Qi vortex above the inn disappeared,   Such a scene quickly attracted the attention of surrounding cultivators.   For a moment.   Countless cultivators cast their gazes in this direction.   When the spirit Qi vortex had formed a few days ago, they knew that a Foundation Establishment cultivator was about to be born here.   Today, everyone knew.   When the spirit Qi vortex dispersed, it marked the birth of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.   The loose cultivators, Immortal Pavilion cultivators, and Immortal City cultivators outside the inn, gazing from afar, suddenly had a burning gleam in their eyes.   A Foundation Establishment cultivator!   And one who had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm within an inn!   Presumably, this Foundation Establishment cultivator shared a similar identity to them—a loose cultivator, maybe?   Breaking through in an inn must mean that this Foundation Establishment cultivator had no fixed residence within Green Wall Immortal City.   Could it be that an unremarkable Qi Refining Great Perfection cultivator had extraordinarily good luck and successfully broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm?   Could there be some secret in this inn that increases the success rate of Foundation Establishment?   Could it be...   For a moment.   Cultivators paying attention to this inn each had their own guesses in their hearts.   But what they didn't know was.   He Song, who was quietly waiting for Master Qingy Yue's arrival at this moment, was not simply a loose cultivator as they thought.   He was in fact someone.   Who had taken six Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   Had been personally taught Foundation Establishment knowledge by two Foundation Establishment Masters.   Witnessed the records of several Foundation Establishment Masters' Foundation Establishment experiences.   And also possessed a secret technique that can be used to increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment, the Qi Sinking into Elixir Field Skill.   With these stack of resources.   He managed to successfully establish his foundation during his seventh attempt to compress his spirit power, becoming an outer disciple of Thick Earth Sect.   With so many identities, resources, and insights combined, He Song's success rate for Foundation Establishment was incredibly high. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m  Under such circumstances, the gap between He Song and the loose cultivators was practically incalculable.   Furthermore.   He Song had already broken through to Foundation Establishment four years ago.   He came here now and made such a big commotion.   The purpose was only to avoid arousing suspicion from the sect by breaking through the Foundation Establishment outside the sect.   As for the guesses about the various hard-earned efforts, brainstorming, and unbeatable luck to succeed in Foundation Establishment, they had never actually happened to He Song.   No matter how the outsiders speculated.   At this moment, Master Qingy Yue had transformed into a tunneling light, silently landing outside the inn.   At the same time, Master Qingy Yue's crisp voice also rang out.    "Fellow Daoist, may I come in for a chat?"   Standing outside the inn.   Master Qingy Yue asked in the direction where He Song was.   A few days ago, when the spirit Qi whirlpool suddenly appeared above the inn, everyone in the inn, including the innkeeper, had already been invited out by the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team.   Now.   Only He Song was in the large inn.   Master Qingy Yue's words were, of course, meant for He Song.   Inside the inn.   Hearing Master Qingy Yue's voice, He Song immediately stood up, walked out of the room, and headed towards the inn's main entrance to welcome her.   "Please come in, Master Uncle."   Without even having seen Master Qingy Yue, He Song had already spoken.   Outside the inn.   When she heard He Song's voice and his address as master uncle, a hint of surprise quickly appeared on Master Qingy Yue's face.   Master Uncle?   And this voice...why does it sound so much like Meng Guan's friend?   With a hint of doubt in her eyes.   Master Qingy Yue decided to step forward and enter the inn.   No matter who it is.   Going in and taking a look will tell.   If it is, the Thick Earth Sect adding another Foundation Establishment Master would be a good thing.   If not... she would still benefit from this address as master uncle.   Among Foundation Establishment Masters, addressing each other as fellow Daoists is sufficient.   It was only because He Song felt that using 'Master Uncle' for his 'new' breakthrough to Foundation Establishment would add some impression points, allowing Master Qingy Yue to take this advantage.   As soon as the two met, Master Qingy Yue would naturally ask He Song to change his address.   He Song knew this very well.   In order to have Master Qingy Yue testify for him, giving her some benefits is necessary.   Although it was only an address, it still counted as a benefit.   Soon.   Master Qingy Yue, who had just stepped into the inn, came face to face with He Song, who was walking towards the inn's entrance.   When the two met.   As their eyes met.   They both stopped in their tracks.   He Song wanted to see Master Qingy Yue's reaction when she discovered that the person who had 'broken through' Foundation Establishment here was him.   As for Master Qingy Yue.   When she saw that the person in front of her was indeed He Song, the doubt in her eyes turned to shock.   Although she had guessed in her heart.   After all, she could still recognize He Song's voice.   Plus, He Song's address as master uncle before he revealed himself had deepened her guess.   However, when He Song stood in front of her in his true form as a Foundation Establishment Master.   The impact on her mind still left Master Qingy Yue startled for a long time.   Inside the inn.   As the two gazed at each other, neither spoke.   He Song got his wish and saw Master Qingy Yue's shocked expression.   Meanwhile, Master Qingy Yue was still lost in her thoughts.   She really didn't expect.   He Song.   A four spirits root cultivator who was just brought into the Thick Earth Sect by Meng Guan, would unexpectedly meet her as a Foundation Establishment Master under such circumstances.   Before today.   She had always felt regretful for Chu Shuangshuang's failure in Foundation Establishment.   But she never thought.   That while her highly-regarded Chu Shuangshuang failed in Foundation Establishment.   He Song, whom she thought had little chance of establishing a foundation, actually succeeded.

Chapter 186 - 186: 186: Heaven Ascending Inn Translator: 549690339   Thinking of Chu Shuangshuang.   A hint of melancholy flashed in Master Qing Yue’s eyes.   Afterwards, she lifted her gaze and carefully observed He Song’s current appearance, her expression on her face gradually becoming gentler.   “Don’t mention the word ‘apprentice uncle’ anymore, now that you have reached Foundation Establishment, we should treat each other as equals. Just call me Qing Yue Daoist Friend from now on.”   “However, why did you come here to Green Wall Immortal City instead of breaking through within the sect?”   After snapping out of her daze, Master Qing Yue’s attitude towards He Song had clearly changed somewhat.   Although she was inherently cold in nature, and it would not be overly warm when she spoke.   But because she was already acquainted with He Song, the conversation also began to resemble friendly chatter between friends, rather than the dialogue between a senior and a junior as before.   Seeing this, He Song stopped looking at Master Qing Yue’s facial expressions.   It must be said that Master Qing Yue’s shocked expression when she first saw him has given He Song a deeper understanding of her.   This Master Qing Yue does not always have very few facial expressions.   At least, when encountering something that shocked her, the expression of astonishment on her face simply couldn’t be faked.   “In that case, I should call you Qing Yue Daoist Friend. I attempted Foundation Establishment two years ago and failed, losing some of my Dao Heart. I felt hopeless for my next breakthrough.”   “So I left the sect and came to the outside world to mend my Dao Heart.”   “Who knew I would be accidentally end up coming here…”   Leading Master Qing Yue into the inn, He Song casually explained the situation to her.   This was also part of He Song’s plan.   Only by informing Master Qing Yue about this would she be able to tell others what He Song wanted her to say whenever someone asked her about it in the future.   With such evidence, there would be no flaws in his story of breaking through away from the sect.   After all, everyone knew that He Song was brought into the Thick Earth Sect by Meng Guan.   And the starting point of He Song’s Immortal Path was the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion under the jurisdiction of Green Wall Immortal City.   It made sense for him to go there to mend his dao heart.   Thus, He Song’s plan had already been more than halfway executed.   Next, he just needed to return to the sect and meet with the Sect Leader Master, then he could continue to settle down in the Thick Earth Sect.   It seemed that with the Seven Star Sect besieging the gate for a long time without leaving, the war between Thick Earth Sect and Seven Star Sect should also come to an end within ten years, right?   With this thought in mind, He Song quickly brought Master Qing Yue to his room.   Sitting face to face, He Song personally began to brew some tea. “I see, I just thought that you should have been in the sect, so why did you come here?”   “But now that you have reached Foundation Establishment, do you need me to escort you back to the sect?”   Seeing He Song brewing tea for her, a strange light flashed in Master Qing Yue’s eyes, and she soon asked.   In her eyes, He Song had just reached Foundation Establishment Realm, but he hadn’t learned any tunneling skills or magic spells, and the artifacts he used were still of medium quality. Despite possessing Foundation Establishment cultivation, he lacked the strength of the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Given the situation, her offer to escort He Song back to the sect was perfectly normal.   If an accident happened to He Song on his solo journey back to the sect, causing the Thick Earth Sect to lose a Foundation Establishment Master, that’d be a huge issue.   Although the chances were very slim, the war between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect had basically reached garbage time at this point, so she didn’t need to guard the Green Wall Immortal City every day.   There were several other Foundation Establishment Masters guarding the Green Wall Immortal City.   Thus, offering to take He Song back to the sect at this time was only natural.   Upon hearing this, He Song was delighted in his heart.   If Master Qing Yue accompanied him back to the sect, he would certainly save some effort in explaining himself.   At least upon entering the sect gate, he would not be interrogated.   The joy in his heart flashed by momentarily, but He Song remained expressionless.   Instead, he looked somewhat puzzled.    “Escort me back to the sect? Don’t you need to stay in Green Wall Immortal City, DAOIST FRIEND? The war between our sect and the Seven Star Sect hasn’t ended yet.”   He Song’s expression of astonishment was seamless.   Master Qing Yue didn’t notice any flaws either.   As a result, after hearing this, she nodded her head immediately.   “It doesn’t matter; there are several other Foundation Establishment Masters guarding this place. Since you haven’t yet gained the strength of Foundation Establishment Realm, I might as well escort you back to the sect and check on my apprentice.”   Accompanying He Song back to the sect was not a whim of Master Qing Yue. It was because Ping’er was on the verge of reaching Foundation Establishment, and she, as a master, had to bring some cultivation resources back to the sect for her, like Foundation Establishment Elixirs.   Her eldest disciple Chu Shuangshuang had already failed in her Foundation Establishment attempt.   This made her feel deep regret.   Now that her second disciple Ping’er was about to reach Foundation Establishment, she naturally wouldn’t ignore it as their master.   If Ping’er could succeed in Foundation Establishment, it would make her feel a bit better.   Accompanying He Song back to the sect was just a matter of convenience.   Even if He Song hadn’t broken through to Foundation Establishment here, she would have made a special trip back to the sect soon to see Ping’er.   “Thank you, Daoist friend.”   “However, a year ago, Sister Shuangshuang had said she wanted to meet me in person. At that time, I had failed to break through to Foundation Establishment and was healing my injuries, so I couldn’t see her.”   “Do you know where Sister Shuangshuang is now? If she’s nearby, I’d like to see her first.”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m   He Song nodded in response.   Then he remembered that a year ago, when Ping’er had sent him a voice transmission, she had mentioned that Chu Shuangshuang had failed her Foundation Establishment and was about to be sent elsewhere.   Before leaving, she had thought of the gift He Song had given her and wanted to meet him in person before she left.   U111UILUnctLe1Y, ne          ulull L nave Lile Lillie            Lilell,              Luey                L geu LU meet.   However, He Song had also said at the time that as soon as he was free, he would surely visit her personally.   Now that he had met Master Qing Yue, who was Chu Shuangshuang’s master, it made sense for He Song to ask her about Chu Shuangshuang’s whereabouts since she should be in the know.   With this in mind, he inquired if Chu Shuangshuang was with Master Qing Yue. If she were there, He Song wouldn’t have to go through all this trouble.   “After Shuangshuang failed her Foundation Establishment, she felt too ashamed to see me again and went to Lianshan Immortal City.”   Seeing He Song asking about Chu Shuangshuang, Master Qing Yue’s eyes dimmed, her heart feeling somewhat bitter.   However, she quickly seemed to think of something and brightened up, looking at He Song and eagerly requesting.   “Since you know her, if you see her again, please try to persuade her to return. As her master, how could I bear to blame her? Whether she succeeded in establishing her foundation or not, it would be nice if she could come back.”   Seeing the sudden change in Master Qing Yue’s expression, He Song had a thought.   It seemed that Master Qing Yue truly loved Chu Shuangshuang dearly.   It made sense, as the two were familiar with each other, and Master Qing Yue personally raised Chu Shuangshuang, with deep feelings between them.   However, He Song quickly waved his hand.   Signaling Master Qing Yue not to worry.   Then.   He continued to speak.   “Sir, don’t be like this. I didn’t know about this before, so I asked randomly. I hope you won’t mind.”   “As for the persuasion, I will do my best to persuade her. Please don’t worry.”   It was just persuasion.   It wasn’t guaranteed that he could persuade her.   He Song agreed, of course, without any pressure.   However, hearing that Chu Shuangshuang felt too ashamed to see Master Qing Yue after failing her Foundation Establishment and went to Lianshan Immortal City, He Song sighed in his heart.   Chu Shuangshuang only had four spirits roots.   The success rate of her Foundation Establishment wasn’t high.   Failure was a reasonable outcome.    But.   She was different from He Song, who had come up from being a loose cultivator, as she was a sect disciple who had been carefully cultivated by a master with Foundation Establishment since childhood.   She chose to escape to Lianshan Immortal City after failing Foundation Establishment and feeling ashamed to see Master Qing Yue again, which was quite normal.   Because in the hearts of sect disciples like Chu Shuangshuang.   Although they thought Foundation Establishment was difficult.   They always had more confidence in it.   So when they failed, they became even more upset and couldn’t let go.   Which led to this happening.   “Since you are willing to help, I won’t take offense.”   “It’s getting late. Why don’t we set off for the sect now? I think Ping’er must be getting impatient.”   Seeing He Song agree, Master Qing Yue visibly relaxed and finally wore a slight smile on her face.   Dne tnen Ill’lteu ne bong LO sec 011.   After He Song nodded and agreed.   Master Qing Yue waved her hand.   The spirit boat He Song had ridden on more than a decade ago shot out of her hand and stopped outside the inn.   They both got on the spirit boat.   Under Master Qing Yue’s control, the spirit boat soared into the sky, rushing towards the direction of the Thick Earth Sect’s gate.   Soon after the spirit boat left.   In Green Wall Immortal City.   Outside the inn where He Song had been staying.   Members of the Immortal City Law Enforcement Team left one after another.   Meanwhile.   The cultivators who were originally watching the commotion from the periphery were now gazing at the inn with deep gazes.   There was a man with an excited expression, standing in front of the inn’s entrance.   “I announce! From today onwards, this inn is officially renamed the Heaven Ascending Inn! ”   “Heaven Ascending Inn, where all who come may ascend to the heavens!”   “A Foundation Establishment master came out of this very place!”   That man was the innkeeper and also the owner of the inn.   Now that he saw He Song being taken away by Master Qing Yue to the Thick Earth Sect, he couldn’t help but jump out and rename the inn to the Heaven Ascending Inn.   For loose cultivators, Immortal Pavilion cultivators, and even Immortal City cultivators.   Stepping into the Foundation Establishment Realm.   It was like ascending to the heavens in one step.   With He Song successfully establishing his foundation here.   The name Heaven Ascending Inn was indeed fitting.   After renaming the inn to Heaven Ascending Inn, the innkeeper raised the room rates more than tenfold.   Even.   The room He Song once lived in was now incredibly expensive.   But even so.   The rooms in Heaven Ascending Inn were still in high demand.   However, He Song had no idea.   At this moment in time, He Song.   Stood side by side with Master Qing Yue on the spirit boat, gazing down at the vast, beautiful landscape below.   Like this.   Several days later.   The spirit boat they were riding finally crossed tens of thousands of miles of land, arriving at the location of the Thick Earth Sect’s gate.   “There’s Thick Earth Sect up ahead. Many years have passed since I last returned, but it still looks the same as before..”

Chapter 187 - 187: 187: The Roadblocker Translator: 549690339   As Master Qingyue’s eyes swept over the various scenes inside the Thick Earth Sect, there was a flash of nostalgia in her eyes.   Beside her,   He Song also looked in the same direction, but he didn’t feel as sentimental as Master Qingyue.   This Thick Earth Sect.   He Song had also lived here for more than ten years.     It was only a few years ago that he finally moved out and built his own cave mansion.   Thus, his return to the sect this time could not be considered a long-awaited homecoming, but merely a few years of wandering outside.   Just a few years.   It was not enough for He Song to feel sentimental. However,   As He Song’s gaze fell into the sect’s mountain gate,   The appearance of a tunneling light made him raise his eyebrows slightly.   This tunneling light…   It seemed familiar.   And why did he feel deja vu as it got closer and closer to him?   For a moment, He Song felt an inexplicable familiarity as he looked at the tunneling light flying in from afar.   It seemed like he had experienced this scene before.   He Song quickly realized what was happening.   It seemed that something similar had happened when he first entered the Thick Earth Sect.   At that time,   He Song looked towards the sect, and saw the tunneling light flying in from afar.   At that time,   He Song was also riding on Master Qingyue’s spirit boat.   At that time,   He Song felt the tunneling light coming closer and closer, getting nearer and nearer.   At that time…   A flash of insight appeared in his eyes, and He Song’s gaze swept over to find a familiar face.   In the light, the figure of Master Yuan Shan appeared indistinctly.   Cultivators had excellent memories.   Even more than ten years later, He Song could still recognize Master Yuan Shan’s appearance.   The moment He Song saw Master Yuan Shan, he immediately understood where the familiar feeling in his heart came from.   More than a decade ago,   Didn’t Master Yuan Shan intercept him in the same way as today when he was about to enter the Thick Earth Sect? Under He Song’s watchful gaze,   In no time,   Master Yuan Shan’s light fell on Master Oängyue’s spirit boat.   As the light scattered, Master Yuan Shan’s figure appeared on the spirit boat. He looked at the two of them and spoke.   “Greetings to Mr. Qing Yue and Mr. He,” Master Yuan Shan said without arrogance, greeting the two with a polite bow.   “Greetings to Master Yuan Shan,” Master Qingyue returned the gesture.   “Greetings to Master Yuan Shan,” He Song also bowed. After the three had exchanged greetings,   A look of shame appeared on Master Yuan Shan’s face.   His gaze fell on Master Qingyue,   And he immediately said,   “Master Qingyue, I trust you’ve been well. I apologize for my offenses in the past; I hope you can be magnanimous.”   At this moment, the Sect Leader’s faction and Master Yan Shan’s faction had reconciled, no longer openly fighting or secretly undermining each other.   Naturally, when facing Master Qingyue, who belonged to a different faction, Master Yuan Shan no longer harbored ill intentions and instead sought to make amends.    As a Foundation Establishment Realm Master,   No one would be a fool.   Previously, the offensive words were only because of factional differences and the need to take a stand for the higher-ups.   Now that the two sides had reconciled and even worked closely together, there was no need to act as before.   Mending the relationship at this moment would be following the general trend.   “Master Yuan Shan, you’re too serious. We all have our duties, and there’s no offense. I’ve also been disrespectful in the past, and I hope you can be magnanimous,” said Master Qingyue.   With Master Yuan Shan’s intention of mending the relationship, Master Qingyue naturally wouldn’t give him the cold shoulder.   They were fellow disciples, after all, and their previous conflicts were just factional disputes.   Now that they were working closely together, she wouldn’t go out of her way to offend a Foundation Establishment Realm Master.   Therefore,   With both sides seeking to mend their relationship, the tension between them quickly dissipated.   Once the relationship between the two was more or less mended, Master Yuan Shan turned his gaze to He Song.   This time, his main target for the investigation was He Song.   After all, he was a newly promoted Foundation Establishment Realm Master, and as a gatekeeper, he needed to come and learn more about him.   It was only because the two sides were already acquainted that he didn’t ask about it right away.   Now that the time was ripe, it was time to raise the question.   “This…”   Looking at He Song and then at Master Qingyue, Master Yuan Shan opened his mouth but didn’t continue, appearing as if he was listening attentively.   It seemed like he was waiting for the two of them to speak.   Seeing this,   Before He Song could even speak, Master Qingyue said what he wanted to say.   “Two years ago, Mr. He failed his Foundation Establishment, causing damage to his Dao heart. Therefore, he left the sect to mend his heart.”   “As a result, he came all the way to Green Wall Immortal City, repaired his Dao heart, and broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in an inn there.”   “I witnessed it myself, so I personally escorted him back to the sect to ensure his safety on the way.”   “He is a disciple of the sect. The incident just occurred for a reason, and he established his foundation outside.”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com   “Now that he’s back at the sect, he intends to meet with the Sect Leader and assume the position of Elder.”   Listening to the crisp voices in his ears, He Song looked towards Master Qing Yue, and couldn’t help but secretly sigh.   His decision to pretend to establish the foundation in the Green Wall Immortal City was the right one.   With Master Qing Yue’s assistance, his Foundation Establishment in Green Wall Immortal City would be a sure thing.   At this moment.   Even if he said he had already established the foundation, and he only went to Green Wall Immortal City just to cover up, no one would believe it.   However, this was exactly what He Song wanted.   His original plan was just like this.   Now that Master Qing Yue cooperated so well, He Song looked at her with admiration.   It seemed.   Master Qing Yue really got things done.   From the side.   Having listened to Master Qing Yue’s description, Master Yuan Shan’s eyes glinted with comprehension.   He had met He Song before, but the two had not communicated much.   However, both He Song and Master Yuan Shan had seen each other before, and knew each other existed.   Master Yuan Shan even discovered when He Song sneaked out of the sect and didn’t catch him on the spot. Instead, he let Wei Fan inform He Song that if he wanted to leave the sect, he could just say so, there was no need for Earth Tunneling.   There were two Foundation Establishment Realm friends behind He Song.   Compared to the average outer disciple, their backgrounds were much deeper.   Now that He Song has also achieved Foundation Establishment.   Combined with Meng Guan and Wei Fan, the three of them would be a powerful force in the Thick Earth Sect.   This force was not to be underestimated even inside the Thick Earth Sect.   Under such circumstances, after hearing Master Qing Yue’s description, Master Yuan Shan had confidence in his heart.   He believed that what Master Qing Yue said must be true, that He Song left the sect to breakthrough in order to mend his Dao heart.    As for other things.   Such as colluding with the Seven Star Sect to obtain Elixir.   With He Song’s identity and the resources he had, there was no need for him to do so.   After all.   Having two Foundation Establishment Realm friends, He Song could get the Foundation Establishment Elixir just by talking. Why would he risk dying and implicating his friends by becoming a traitor?   Moreover.   The Seven Star Sect has been trapped inside the mountain gate and hasn’t come out for a long time. They don’t have the ability to develop traitors within the Thick Earth Sect anymore.   Various conjectures flashed through his mind.   Eventually.   Master Yuan Shan quickly nodded, no longer doubting Master Qing Yue’s words.   As for why He Song left the sect to breakthrough, he had a clear idea in his mind.   Presumably, it was as Master Qing Yue said, due to the damage to his Dao heart that he left the sect to repair it. After repairing his Dao heart, he would then break through in the nearby Green Wall Immortal City.   After coming to this conclusion, Master Yuan Shan bowed his hands towards   He Song.   “Mr. He, please excuse me for my duty.”   “I will leave first, good luck to both of you.”   Having said these words, Master Yuan Shan did not linger. He lept off the spirit boat and turned into tunneling light in mid-air, heading back in the direction he came from.   Seeing Master Yuan Shan leave.   Master Qing Yue looked at He Song and gave him a faint smile, saying.   “Mr. He, you don’t need to take it to heart. He has responsibilities, and his involvement was just a routine matter.”   Hearing this, He Song nodded but didn’t say anything.   Master Yuan Shan’s arrival was unexpected, but fortunately, the matter was perfectly resolved. Now, there was no need to worry about any unexpected incidents in the future.   His departure from the sect for a breakthrough would have a conclusion after this incident.   Even if a Golden Elixir Master asked about it, there would be no flaws in his departure from the sect to breakthrough.   In this way.   He Song’s plan to return to the Thick Earth Sect was successfully completed.   Next.   As long as he didn’t expose any flaws when he meets the Sect Leader, he could cultivate and become stronger within the Thick Earth Sect as a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.   However, thinking about the upcoming meeting with the Sect Leader, He Song felt a little helpless.   If it were not for the fact that after the breakthrough in Foundation Establishment, he had to meet the Sect Leader in order to be promoted to an elder position.   He wouldn’t have wanted to meet the Sect Leader.   Although Master Fa Xuan wouldn’t harm him.   However, the feeling of having his life in someone else’s hands still made He Song very uncomfortable.   That’s why he wanted to move away from the Thick Earth Sect.   But there is no choice now.   If he wants to get various resources within the Thick Earth Sect, he has to go through the process.   After psychologically preparing himself, He Song and Master Qing Yue quickly arrived at the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect.   Master Qing Yue seemed to be very familiar with the main peak.   She led He Song up the main peak, constantly climbing upwards.   Soon, the two of them arrived in front of a great hall at the top of the main peak.   “Junior Qing Yue, with the newly founded Cultivator He Song, is requesting an audience with Sect Leader Master.”   Bringing He Song to this place, Master Qing Yue bowed her hands and spoke.   He Song, seeing the situation, immediately followed suit, bowing his hands in salute as well.   He was about to face a Golden Elixir Master directly.   He Song’s face was calm, but his heart tightened.   What he hoped for now was that there would be no accidents.   Thinking of this, He Song thought of Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   Both of them had seen the Sect Leader before.   They were fine.   He should be fine too.   As this thought settled in his mind, He Song’s nerves eased, and some of his worries disappeared..

Chapter 188 - 188: 188: Master Fa Xuan Translator: 549690339   “Come in.”   Soon, a cold voice was heard from inside the hall.   Upon hearing the remark, Master Qingy Yue led He Song into the hall.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎   Inside the hall.   There were various furnishings, not complex, yet profoundly traditional.     With a quick look, He Song realized that it seemed everything in the hall was a part of the hall itself.   Seeing this, he finally understood.   These items were likely inherent to the main precipice of the Thick Earth Sect.   The main peak of Thick Earth Sect was actually a high-quality artifact named the Mountain Seal.   The mountain under their feet was the real body of this spirit artifact.   The palaces on it were naturally transformed by the spirit artifact.   The items in the hall were naturally part of the spirit artifact.   It seems that when the Ancestor Yuanying of the Thick Earth Sect originally refined the Mountain Seal, there was an idea of using this top-quality artifact as a main peak, which included the architectural style of thousands of years ago, branded in the hall of the Mountain Seal.   That’s why the objects in the hall looked so antique.   Having scanned with his eyes and kept his emotions in check, He Song followed closely behind Master Qingy Yue and went forward.   Soon, a silhouette appeared in front of them.   Before He Song could salute and greet him…   The figure nodded slightly and then spoke.   “Well done, well done, you three have supported each other from the very beginning and all have achieved    now. This is indeed a great story for the Thick Earth Sect.”   “Back in the day… ah…”   “Well, since you have established your foundation, you are now an elder of the Thick Earth Sect.”   “All your rewards have been transferred to the sect’s treasury. After you communicate with the treasury, you will receive them.”   “Go back, cultivate well, and don’t tarnish the name of our Thick Earth Sect.” Seeing He Song, Master Fa Xuan’s eyes seemed to have a flicker of light.   He first praised He Song and his companions for their mutual support, calling it a great story.   But, immediately after the praising, he sighed.   Later, as if he had lost interest in speaking, he motioned for them to leave.   Seeing this…   He Song and Master Qingy Yue could only leave the palace bewildered.   Even so…   After leaving the palace, both shared a look of surprise.   He Song was confused. The first sentence was praising, then sighing in the next, and the third sentence was basically driving them away.   What had happened?   Master Qingy Yue was also puzzled.   When she brought Meng Guan to meet the Sect Leader, he did not have such an attitude.   Could it be…   Looking back at the huge palace, Master Qingy Yue somehow remembered a rumor within the Thick Earth Sect.   It was said that Master Fa Xuan and Master Yan Shan have been close friends since childhood.   However, after a few incidents, their relationship suddenly changed.   With a thoughtful look, Master Qingy Yue chose not to tell He Song about it, deciding to talk about it later on.   At the moment, they were still on the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect.   If she voiced out her guesses now, it might upset Master Fa Xuan.   Therefore…   Fifteen minutes after climbing up the mountain, they came back down.   At Master Qingy Yue’s invitation, He Song didn’t rush to get the rewards mentioned by Master Fa Xuan but rather visited her cave mansion.    In the cave mansion of Master Qingy Yue…   He Song and Master Qingy Yue sat facing each other.   At their side, Ping’er was looking at He Song with a complex expression, her eyes flowing with thoughts.   Just then…   When Master Qingy Yue informed her to come to the cave mansion quickly, she was ecstatic.   Assuming that Master Qingy Yue had returned to visit her, to encourage her for her imminent Foundation Establishment.   But she didn’t expect…   When she arrived in Master Qingy Yue’s cave mansion, she saw a familiar figure.   But before she could greet He Song…   Master Qingy Yue already spoke, asking her to greet her junior uncle.   Junior uncle?   Where did this junior uncle come from?   Confused, Ping’er looked at He Song.   Yet, she saw He Song constantly waving his hand at Master Qingy Yue, indicating her it’s unnecessary to be so formal.   Only after listening to the conversation between He Song and Master Qingy Yue did she realize that he had successfully achieved Foundation Establishment.   At that moment, He Song had become a Foundation Establishment Master.   And that…   Was the main reason Master Qingy Yue asked her to call He Song her junior uncle.   For a moment, Ping’er was taken aback.   Foundation establishment.   He Song had established his foundation!   The He Song whom she met in the Spirit Skill Pavilion of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   The one who started as a loose cultivator and then gradually became a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect…   Had actually achieved Foundation Establishment!   Even now…   He Song and Master Qingy Yue had already been sipping tea for a while, and she still couldn’t get back to her senses.   As for He Song and Master Qingy Yue, they didn’t bother her at that moment. Instead, they started talking about a secret rumor in the Thick Earth Sect.   “Do you have any idea why the Sect Leader’s attitude has changed so dramatically?”   To keep He Song from being confused for too long, Master Qingy Yue opted to share her suspicions with him after some careful thought.   If she let He Song guess for himself, he might be utterly perplexed by the Sect   Leader’s attitude.   Instead of leaving He Song in confusion.   It would be better for her to tell him about the secret.   In this way, He Song wouldn’t overthink things, and his feeling of belonging, as well as his future cultivation in the Thick Earth Sect, would be stronger.   “This… I really don’t know. I appreciate your guidance.”   Shifting his gaze from Ping’er, who still looked dazed, He Song responded with a frown.   He had no clue about the drastic changes in Master Fa Xuan’s attitude.   But he didn’t care much either.   When returning to the sect, all he wanted was to obtain as many Foundation Establishment skill methods as possible from the Thick Earth Sect. If possible, he even wanted to try the “Golden Elixir Skill Means”.   Not for any other reason.   It was simply because He Song felt it necessary to have a backup plan.   Like before, when the Thick Earth Sect suddenly waged war against the Seven Star Sect, he had no choice but to flee, setting up his own cave mansion.   If the Golden Elixir Master hadn’t considerably advanced the war, He Song probably would have already been under another sect’s influence, preparing to join a new one.   Therefore, he intended not to miss out on the Foundation Establishment and even the “Golden Elixir Skill Means” in the future, so as to avoid such an awkward situation.   As long as he could learn.   Learn first, and then see how things go.   Whether or not these things would become useful, he could always decide later.    After all, once the knowledge was imprinted in his mind.   He could always recall it when needed.   In this way, even if he was forced to leave the Thick Earth Sect in the future, he wouldn’t end up like previously, without any Realm   cultivation skills at least.   Meanwhile, Master Qingy Yue had no idea what He Song was thinking of.   She assumed that He Song was still pondering over the attitude issue of Master Fa Xuan, so she quickly started explaining.   “It’s been said that Master Fa Xuan and Master Yan Shan were once very close, but for reasons unknown, their interactions dwindled over time.”   “Probably, the camaraderie between the three of you reminded him of something, causing such a dramatic shift in his attitude.”   “And, the two Foundation Establishment Elixirs that he intentionally gifted you may be a reflection of his nostalgia for past camaraderie.”   “His sudden change of attitude this time could simply be due to some past memories invoked upon seeing you.”   “Rest assured, it isn’t specifically against you.”   “Perhaps, when you go to collect your rewards from the sect’s treasure house, there might be a pleasant surprise waiting for you too.”   Master Qingy Yue shared, as if spilling beans from a bamboo tube, everything she knew with He Song to help him understand the situation.   Upon hearing the secrets revealed by Master Qingy Yue, He Song suddenly had a realization.   That’s how it was.   This explained everything.   Master Fa Xuan and Master Yan Shan had a great relationship.   However, whether before or after reaching the Elixir Establishment, there was definitely a problem between them.   Otherwise, they wouldn’t have created two factions and started battling, both openly and behind the scenes.   But perhaps, the appearance of He Song and the other two.   Or some other reasons.   Had gradually improved the relationship between Master Fa Xuan and Master   Yan Shan.   That’s why the two factions stopped confronting each other recently. Master Fa Xuan and Master Yan Shan joined forces to injure Master Tian Shu of the Seven Star Sect, seizing a place from the Seven Star Sect.   Furthermore, Master Fa Xuan had specially gifted He Song with two Foundation Establishment Elixirs and gifted Wei Fan one Foundation Establishment Elixir too.   Such actions were probably due to their friendship, which had deeply moved him, and hence he bestowed the Elixirs.   Otherwise, why hadn’t he ever gifted any Foundation Establishment Elixirs to regular outer disciples?   Because Master Fa Xuan and Master Yan Shan had been very close before. And seeing He Song and his friends support each other right from the start,   Made him generously show kindness due to the proverb, ‘Love the house as well as the crow.’   In this way, everything made sense.   “So, that’s how it is. I never knew such secrets were involved.”   “Thank you for clearing up my confusion; I’m truly grateful.”   Having understood everything, He Song thanked Master Qingy Yue with a bow and gratitude.   If Master Qingy Yue hadn’t spoken up.   He wouldn’t have known about the existence of this relationship.   Although he didn’t care much about these things, and was more concerned about whether he could reenter the Thick Earth Sect and learn the Foundation Establishment skill methods there.   But now, since Master Qingy Yue had told him, it had dissolved his doubts and made him understand everything.   Therefore, He Song wouldn’t be stingv with a word of thanks.   “Don’t mention it; this isn’t a deep secret. If you were curious, you would definitely have been able to find out.”   “I was just making a casual comment. It’s not worth mentioning.” Faced with He Song’s gratitude, Master Qingy Yue responded with a smile.   With his confusion cleared, He Song.   After casually chatting with Master Qingy Yue for a while, He Song no longer wished to stay longer.   After drinking some more tea.   He Song excused himself, saying he had some other matters to attend to.   Master Qingy Yue didn’t detain him much; instead, she advised him to set up his cave mansion as soon as possible.   He Song promised to do so.   After bidding farewell to Master Qingy Yue and Ping’er, he quickly left her cave mansion.   Heading directly towards the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect.   There.   A generous reward awaited his collection..

Chapter 189 - 189: 189 Master’s Generous Reward Translator: 549690339   This was a reward from Master Fa Xuan.   Although He Song didn’t know the exact value, he was sure it wouldn’t be small.   On the way to the Thick Earth Sect’s treasure vault.   He Song didn’t use the Blood Escape Skill.   He kept in mind his current status.     Right now, he was still just a cultivator who had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage, without having learned any Foundation Establishment techniques.   If he used the Blood Escape Skill, it would immediately arouse suspicion from other Foundation Establishment masters.   Wouldn’t that spoil all his plans?   Moreover, it would attract suspicion for no reason.   There would be more loss than gain.   Under these circumstances, He Song still used the Mountain Wind Riding Skill, just like a Qi Refining cultivator, and headed towards the treasure vault of the Thick Earth Sect with a light body.   In no time.   He Song appeared at the foot of the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect.   After taking out the Elder Token given by Master Fa Xuan from his storage bag.   He Song quickly used the Elder Token in his hand to access the sect’s treasure vault.   And he received all the rewards given to him by Master Fa Xuan from the treasure vault.   A spirit boat.   Three blank Disciple Tokens.   200 contribution points.   A top-rank storage bag.   A token with the word “cave mansion” engraved on it.   He put everything into the newly acquired top-rank storage bag.   He Song didn’t stay at the location of the treasure vault, but instead returned to the small courtyard where he used to live during his Qi Refining stage after a brief pause.   Now, He Song had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and hadn’t had time to open a cave mansion within the range of the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   Therefore, if he wanted to have a place to stay, he could only return to the small courtyard where he had lived in during his Qi Refining stage.   It wouldn’t be too late to find another place to establish a cave mansion after he had taken care of other matters.   Back in his own small courtyard.   He Song activated the Array Skills in the courtyard.   Soon, the courtyard was enveloped by the Illusion Array, and He Song, who was inside, naturally disappeared from sight.   Inside the courtyard.   With a thought, He Song’s divine sense instantly surged out, covering the entire courtyard.   In this way, as long as he didn’t withdraw his divine sense, no one could bypass him and find out the specific situation inside the courtyard.   And once other cultivators came to probe, He Song would know immediately and drive them away.   Such an approach allowed He Song to be unmonitored by anyone in his courtyard.   After doing all this.   He Song finally breathed a sigh of relief and put everything from the top-rank storage bag on the table in front of him.   A top-rank storage bag.   It was different from ordinary storage bags and those inferior storage bags that cost a hundred spirit stones each.   The space contained in a top-rank storage bag was at least ten times larger than that of an ordinary storage bag, while an ordinary storage bag’s space was at least ten times larger than that of an inferior storage bag.   Such a vast space made the top-rank storage bag the mainstream choice for Foundation Establishment cultivators.   As for Qi Refining cultivators, they could generally only use ordinary storage bags or even inferior ones.   The price of a top-rank storage bag was much higher than that of an ordinary one.   Qi Refining cultivators actually had a hard time getting their hands on such genuine good stuff like top-rank storage bags.   Even He song.    During his Qi Refining stage, he already had tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of spirit stones.   However, he had only heard of the existence of top-rank storage bags.   Wanted to buy one?   He didn’t have the connections for that.   However.   When He Song reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, the top-rank storage bag he had only heard of quietly appeared in his hands.   “As expected, in the Cultivation World, one’s cultivation level is the most important thing.”   “As long as the cultivation level is high enough, one’s status and position will be elevated accordingly.”   “A big fist is the hard truth.”   Looking at the top-rank storage bag in his hand and recalling his past predicament of being unable to buy one, He Song couldn’t help but sigh inwardly.   That’s how it was in the Cultivation World.   Once the cultivation level was reached, everything would work out.   No matter one’s status or position, or their power and influence, they would all be within reach.   But if one’s cultivation was not enough.   No matter how hard one worked, or how well they networked, they would still hit a wall.   Putting down the top-rank storage bag in his hand, He Song’s gaze swept over the other items.   These items.   Were the tangible benefits that his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm had brought him.   As for the other changes in one’s status, position, and power, he would have to discover them over time.   The items in front of him were the ones he could actually hold in his hand at the moment.   At first glance.   He Song’s gaze locked onto the spirit boat.   A spirit boat.   Mana-driven, it could fly at extremely high speeds in the sky, and the consumption of mana was much less compared to using a tunneling skill.   The power of the spirit boat mostly came from spirit stones.   As long as there were enough spirit stones, the spirit boat could keep going.   A cultivator only needed to use mana to make slight adjustments, and the consumption of mana could be considered negligible.   In the Cultivation World, when the distance was long, cultivators would use the spirit boat to travel.   Using tunneling light all the way would be faster than a spirit boat, but it would truly consume their own mana.   It’s fine for short distances.   Once the distance is long enough, the mana spent on the tunneling skill will be massive.   Perhaps by the time you arrive, your mana would already be exhausted.   In such situations, the spirit boat is needed.   To maintain their peak combat power, cultivators generally use spirit boats for long-distance travel.   This practice effectively prevents others from taking advantage of their vulnerability.   Protecting cultivators from being attacked by evildoers when their mana has been greatly depleted.   It can be said that,   in the Cultivation World, spirit boats are indispensable tools for cultivators when traveling.   Picking up the spirit boat on the table, He Song’s gaze swept over it.   A flash of admiration quickly appeared in He Song’s eyes.   The spirit boat seemed to be carved from white jade, with intricate patterns on it, making it extremely beautiful.   After playing with it for a while,   He Song’s divine sense entered the spirit boat.   Information about the usage of the boat and other related details appeared in his mind.   Once he had assimilated all the information, a flash of realization appeared in He Song’s eyes.   “The White Jade Boat, made of white spirit jade as the main body and refined   with many precious materials, is very fast and has defensive capabilities.” “After refining it with mana, it can be stored in the Elixir Field and taken out at any time. ”    “The boat has a spirit stone groove, and after putting spirit stones into it, you can control it at will.”   The name White Jade Boat was quite fitting, as it closely resembled the boat in front of He Song.   With a body like white jade, it was no wonder it was called the White Jade Boat.   The boat’s appearance was quite appealing, which made He Song quite fond of it.   However, since the White Jade Boat was now his possession, He Song wasted no time in using his mana to begin refining it.   This refinement process, took several days to complete.   Fortunately, the White Jade Boat was just a spirit boat, with no complex features, so it only took a few days for He Song to refine it.   If it were a high-quality artifact, the time spent on refining it would be much longer.   It would take at least a few months for a Foundation Establishment Master to refine a high-quality artifact.   Adding the time needed to familiarize with a high-quality artifact, it would likely take a year.   A few days later,   He Song casually pointed a finger, and the palm-sized White Jade Boat immediately transformed into a stream of light and entered his body.   Eventually, under the cover of his mana, it became extremely small and rested within He Song’s Elixir Field.   He Song had successfully refined the White Jade Boat and stored it in his Elixir Field.   After integrating the White Jade Boat into his Elixir Field, He Song’s gaze shifted and quickly fell upon other items on the table.   Blank Disciple Tokens.   Three of them.   These three blank tokens would allow He Song to bring three people into the Thick Earth Sect as outer disciples.   This was a privilege granted to Foundation Establishment Masters by the Thick Earth Sect.   When Meng Guan achieved Foundation Establishment, it was through these three spots that He Song and Wei Fan were brought into the Thick Earth Sect. In this way, when a cultivator achieves Foundation Establishment,   it is believed that one who attains enlightenment will allow even their domestic animals to reach heaven.   He Song was once a beneficiary of this rule.   Now, having received these three blank tokens, he had a way to bring others into the Thick Earth Sect.   However,   He Song just glanced at the three blank tokens in front of him and then placed them in the nearby top-rank storage bag.   For He Song at the moment, these tokens were actually not very useful.   Although they were valuable, he had no one in mind that he wanted to bring into the Thick Earth Sect.   His dear friends, apart from Lin Cong, all had already entered the Thick Earth Sect and became Foundation Establishment Masters one by one.   Meng Guan, Wei Fan, and Zhao Lin were now Elders of the Foundation Establishment Realm in the Thick Earth Sect.   They did not need He Song’s tokens.   As for Lin Cong, the only one who had not succeeded in Foundation   Establishment,   he was now over sixty years old, and even if brought into the Thick Earth Sect, he would no longer have the chance to achieve Foundation Establishment.   Therefore, He Song didn’t care much about these three blank tokens.   After storing the three blank tokens, He Song’s gaze shifted again and quickly landed on the last item on the table.   It was a token.   The word ‘Mansion” was engraved on the token.   He Song had heard about the function of this token before.   Upon becoming a Foundation Establishment Master,   most Foundation Establishment Masters would open a cave mansion within the scope of the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   As for this token,Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m   after deciding on the location of your cave mansion, you could take this token to seek the Artifact Refining Hall’s personnel within the Sect.   Upon seeing the token, the Artifact Refining Hall’s personnel would specially assign someone to create a cave mansion and set up Array Skills for you.   As long as you lead the Artifact Refining Hall’s personnel to the location where you want to establish the cave mansion, and then hand the token over to them, you can leave afterwards.   After a few days, a completed cave mansion will be arranged at your chosen location.   At the same time, a new token will be handed to you.   This new token, is used to control the various Arrays within the cave mansion.   From then on, the cave mansion will belong solely to you.   This process is something almost all Foundation Establishment Elders of the Thick Earth Sect go through.   Opening a cave mansion within the gates of the Thick Earth Sect, is not simply a matter of digging a hole..

Chapter 190 - 190: 190: Foundation Establishment Secret Technique Translator: 549690339   Putting this token with the word “cave mansion” carved on it into his top-rank storage bag, He Song had a thought, and another token appeared in his hand.   This was the Thick Earth Sect’s Elder Token.   It was given to He Song personally by Master Fa Xuan.   It represented He Song’s identity as an elder of the Thick Earth Sect.   It could also connect with the sect’s treasure vault, allowing him to exchange items from the treasure vault as an elder.     At this moment.   Fiddling with the Elder Token.   He Song’s gaze was directed towards the main peak of the Thick Earth Sect. “It seems that the surprise Master Qingyue mentioned is indeed true.” “Two hundred contribution points, worth thirty thousand spirit stones, equivalent to the annual salary of a Foundation Establishment elder.”   “Master Fa Xuan is really generous, giving me ten years’ worth of annual salary directly. ”   “I haven’t seen Lao Meng and Wei receive so many rewards when they returned before.”   “Although I’m not short of spirit stones now, it’s still nice to have an extra thirty thousand.”   “However, next, I would need to go to the Book Collection Pavilion and use these contribution points to exchange for some Foundation Establishment Realm skills.”   “After that, I’ll go to the sect’s Artifact Refining Hall to purchase a high-quality offensive and defensive artifact for self-defense.”   “Also, I need to purchase some Defense Spirit Amulets for the Foundation Establishment Realm for self-preservation from the sect.”   “I wonder if there are any poisons in the sect that can turn Foundation Establishment cultivators on their heads; it doesn’t seem like a bad idea to prepare some for sneak attacks.”   After sorting out all the things he had to do in his mind, He Song saw that the table was already empty, and he promptly stood up.   He was ready to go to the Artifact Refining Hall to secure his cave mansion.   Just back in the sect.   He Song, who had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Stage in the eyes of others.   Within ten years, it was impossible for him to leave the sect in the limelight.   There was no choice.   There were many people in the Thick Earth Sect, and it would be difficult to avoid unnecessary trouble if he left the sect rashly without any Foundation Establishment skills.   Therefore, He Song had no choice but to open a cave mansion within the scope of the Thick Earth Sect for his own safety.   When he was not needed, he would stay in the cave mansion.   When necessary, he could use the Mountain Escaping Skill to leave the Thick Earth Sect quietly from underground.   In this way, he could avoid being discovered by others and keep his movements completely hidden.   It would not delay his affairs and would not cause other consequences.   After making a decision, He Song’s figure quickly arrived at the Artifact Refining Hall of the Thick Earth Sect.   After displaying his cave mansion token and stating that he wanted his cave mansion to be adjacent to Meng Guan and Wei Fan’s cave mansions, He Song immediately turned and left.   The following matters did not require his attention.   He just needed to wait a few days, and the people of the Artifact Refining Hall would naturally deliver the new cave mansion’s token to his hand.   By then.   He would be neighbors with Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   Unfortunately, his two friends were still in the Mountain Immortal City, and he didn’t know when they would return.   Leaving the Artifact Refining Hall.   After identifying the direction, He Song quickly headed towards the Book Collection Pavilion of the Thick Earth Sect.   Book Collection Pavilion.   He Song had been here twice.   The first time was when he first joined the Thick Earth Sect, coming here to purchase secret skills and the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   The second time was when he exchanged Array Tao Introductory Insights for Amulet Tao Introductory Insights, and found the Mountain Escaping Skill.   This time.    It was his third visit.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎   And it was also the first time He Song, as a Foundation Establishment Master, came to the Book Collection Pavilion.   Upon arriving at the Book Collection Pavilion, Yang Yan’s figure appeared in front of him.   Yang Yan.   He was the keeper of the Book Collection Pavilion.   A few years ago, when He Song came here to exchange for the Cultivation Truth, he was the one who served him.   Seeing He Song, Yang Yan opened his mouth unconsciously.   “Greeting Brother He…no, Greeting Elder He. The Foundation Establishment skills are on the second floor; please go up and check them yourself, and hand them over to me when you leave.”   However, halfway through, Yang Yan’s words changed.   Because he found that, a few years ago, He Song, who was only at the ninth-tier Qi Refining, had already reached Foundation Establishment when he came back now.   At the moment, He Song was already a Foundation Establishment Master. Naturally, the brother he was originally addressing turned into Elder.   “Alright, I’ll go upstairs now.”   He Song gave a friendly smile to Yang Yan in response and went upstairs after replying to him.   Also, just as at the moment He Song went upstairs,   Watching He Song’s departing figure, Yang Yan couldn’t help but start daydreaming.   “Foundation Establishment…l didn’t expect that in just a few short years, the brother who had old dealings with Brother Song Zhen managed to successfully reach Foundation Establishment in such a short time.”   “Since he can reach Foundation Establishment, as a disciple of the Thick Earth Sect, can I also reach Foundation Establishment?”   For a moment, a burning ambition appeared in Yang Yan’s gaze as he looked at He Song’s back figure.   The thought of being able to reach Foundation Establishment just like others crossed his mind.   Not until He Song disappeared at the staircase of the second floor,   Did Yang Yan withdraw his gaze.   However, even so.   His mood was still surging.   Thick Earth Sect.   As expected from a Golden Elixir Great Sect.   He, a humble outer disciple, actually had the honor of witnessing a Foundation Establishment Master emerge.   Moreover, this happened right before his eyes.   How could he not think deeply about it?   He Song had no idea about Yang Yan’s thoughts.   After reaching the second floor.   He Song’s gaze swept through, and he immediately saw rows of jade slips.   However, compared to the vast ocean of books on the first floor of the Book Collection Pavilion, the number of jade slips placed on the second floor was much fewer.   He Song was not puzzled by this.   Qi Refining stage skills were supposed to be plentiful.   The history of the Cultivation World is long, and the Qi Refining stage skills created by cultivators are as numerous as the sea’s waters and beyond count.   Most of these Qi Refining stage skills have been buried in the long river of history.   Only a few Qi Refining stage skills can continue to be passed down.   However, even so, the number of Qi Refining stage skills is astonishing enough.   But.   The number of Foundation Establishment techniques is much fewer than that of Qi Refining stage skills.   Foundation Establishment is the starting point of cultivating immortality. Foundation Establishment stage skills are not something that can be created by just anyone.   When you reach Foundation Establishment, you have taken the most critical step in the Immortal Path.   The following Immortal Path can be continued step by step as long as you have opportunities, willpower, perseverance, resources, and so on.   Foundation Establishment stage methods are naturally incomparable to that of the Qi Refining stage.   He Song arrived on the second floor of the Book Collection Pavilion and casually glanced through it, seeing many various methods he had never heard of before, as well as some Foundation Establishment methods he had occasionally heard of.    Earth Dragon Skill: “With mana, you can transform rocks into earth dragons.   Controlled by divine sense, they can be used for both offense and defense.”   Dust Cloak Skill: “Using mana to condense dust to wrap around yourself for protection, sheltering from sneak attacks.”   Thick Earth Seal: “Condensing a great seal with mana, controlled by divine sense, it can be used for both offense and defense. It can attack the enemy and protect oneself.”   Fire-Melting Shield: “Forming a shield with mana and controlled by divine sense, can be attached to Artifacts to enhance their defensive capabilities.”   Phantom Escaping Skill: “Using mana to cast a tunneling skill, forming phantoms behind you to confuse the enemy.”   Thick Earth Formulas: “Foundation Establishment Realm Complete Manual.”   His gaze swept over, and He Song passed by a variety of skills, stopping at the location of the Thick Earth Formulas.   Thick Earth Formulas.   It is a powerful cultivation skill that can be cultivated all the way to the Yuanying stage.   Although the name doesn’t sound impressive.   In fact, the name of the Thick Earth Sect comes from the Thick Earth Formulas.   Within the Thick Earth Sect, a significant portion of cultivators’ practiced skills are from the Thick Earth Formulas.   During the Qi Refining stage, they cultivate the Qi Refining Realm’s Thick Earth Formulas.   During the Foundation Establishment stage, they practice the Foundation Establishment Realm’s Thick Earth Formulas.   During the Golden Elixir stage, they practice the Golden Elixir Realm’s Thick Earth Formulas.   When it comes to the Yuanying stage, they don’t know anymore.   He Song stopped here for the reason that he knew the Thick Earth Formulas were a powerful method that could be cultivated all the way to the Yuanying stage, so he intentionally stopped to take a look.   At the moment, although He Song’s cultivation had reached the Foundation Establishment stage, the technique he practiced was still the Qi Refining Realm’s Thick Earth Formulas.   Although it was usable.   But the cultivation speed was very slow.   However, due to the unavailability of other cultivation methods before, He Song had to continue practicing it.   But now things were different.   He Song had returned to the Thick Earth Sect, so naturally, he could obtain the sect’s Foundation Establishment techniques.   No matter if it was a cultivation skill, a skill, or any Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truths.   With He Song’s current status as a Foundation Establishment Master, he could access any of them without restriction.   Therefore.   When He Song saw the Foundation Establishment Realm’s Thick Earth Formulas appear before him, his heart was immediately set on them.   He must get the Thick Earth Formulas today!   The day for changing his cultivation skill was today.   Without any hesitation, he took the jade slip of the Thick Earth Formulas in his hand, and quickly continued searching.   Now that he had the Foundation Establishment stage cultivation skill.   Next.   It would be the skills and techniques to deal with enemies.   “The Earth Dragon skill isn’t bad, although I don’t know the strength of the   Earth Dragon condensed by mana, it should not be too weak if it’s called a Foundation Establishment technique.”   The jade slip of the Earth Dragon Skill was taken into He Song’s hand.   “Thick Earth Seal can also be chosen since it can both attack and defend. Techniques like this Seal Skill are usually very powerful and should become a lethal move.”   The jade slip of the Thick Earth Seal was also taken into He Song’s hand.   “Phantom Escaping Skill… Even though I already have the Blood Escape Skill, I’ll add a tunneling skill for camouflage, so that I wouldn’t arouse suspicion.”   The jade slip of the Phantom Escaping Skill was also taken into He Song’s hand.   “Fire-Melting Shield? To increase the Artifact’s defense? If I buy a high-quality mana shield and use this Fire-Melting Shield, my defense should become much safer, right?”   He Song didn’t miss the jade slip of the Fire-Melting Shield.   “Dust Cloak Skill? After condensing the Dust Cloak, it can prevent sneak attacks? For the sake of my life, I might as well learn it so that I don’t get caught off- guard. ”   The jade slip of the Dust Cloak Skill was also taken into He Song’s hand.   After taking all these jade slips in his hand, He Song felt he wanted everything as his eyes swept across rows of slips.   However, after thinking about it, he decided to take only this many for now.   He will take the remaining Foundation Establishment stage techniques afterward, gradually..

Chapter 191 - 191: 191: Thick Earth Seal Translator: 549690339   Anyway, he had plenty of time.   After the Foundation Establishment.   There was no longer the need to break through to Foundation Establishment before the age of sixty, as was the case during the Qi Refining stage.   Average cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm have a lifespan of around two hundred years.   After consuming a large number of Longevity Elixirs or heavenly materials, their lifespan could extend up to around three hundred years.     If they have a strong destiny and find some precious spirit medicine, their lifespan might increase a bit more.   However, it should never exceed three hundred and fifty years.   In Foundation Establishment Realm, three hundred and fifty years is a bottleneck.   After all, even for cultivators who reach the Golden Elixir Realm, their lifespan is merely five hundred years.   While they can also consume Longevity Elixirs and heavenly materials for longevity, there is still a gap between the three hundred and fifty years in the Foundation Establishment Realm and the five hundred years in the Golden Elixir Realm.   Even so.   In the Foundation Establishment Realm, there are none of the restraints of needing to break through before sixty, as there are in the Qi Refining stage.   Upon achieving Foundation Establishment.   He had already set foot on the Immortal Path.   On the Immortal Path, a cultivator’s body will always be at its peak status and could break through the realm when their lifespan is near its end.   Even if a cultivator has never consumed any Longevity Elixirs or heavenly materials and their lifespan is only two hundred years.   They could still attempt to break through to the Golden Elixir Realm when they are one hundred and ninety-nine years old. Without any risk of decreased success rate.   Under such circumstances.   He Song had all the time in the world.   As an everlasting being, He Song.   He doesn’t even need to consider any limitations of time.   As long as he wanted, someday, all these Foundation Establishment cultivation skills would be his!   With this thought flashing through his mind, He Song picked up the jade slip and began to descend the stairs.   The quiet room on the first floor of the Book Collection Pavilion was the place where he would receive all the cultivation skills contained within these jade slips.   Soon.   Under the respectful gaze of Yang Yan, He Song walked into the quiet room with several jade slips.   In the quiet room, He Song took one jade slip after another in his hands and let his divine sense explore them, then accepted all of the Foundation Establishment cultivation skills from these jade slips.   “Thick Earth Formulas” for establishing foundation.   “Earth Dragon Skill”, “Dust Robe Skill”, “Thick Earth Seal”, “Melting Fire Shield”, “Phantom Earth Tunneling Skill”.   After recording all of the Foundation Establishment cultivation skills in his mind, He Song opened the door of the quiet room and handed them over to   Yang Yan.   These six Foundation Establishment cultivation skills.   Each one required contribution points for exchange.   The price was not expensive either.   The full version of “Thick Earth Formulas” for establishing foundation only required one contribution point.   As for the other five Foundation Establishment cultivation skills, all except for Thick Earth Seal, required ten contribution points.   The Thick Earth Seal was the most expensive, requiring twenty contribution points.   Thus.   Together, the contribution points needed to exchange these Foundation Establishment cultivation skills was sixty-one.   Using the conversion of one contribution point for one hundred and fifty spirit stones.   The Foundation Establishment cultivation skills that He Song exchanged for required a total of nine thousand one hundred and fifty spirit stones.   After handing over all the cultivation skills, the two hundred contribution points bestowed by Master Fa Xuan on He Song’s elder token was reduced to only one hundred and thirty-nine.   The spending of nearly ten thousand spirit stones made He Song somewhat astonished.    Indeed.   After Foundation Establishment, the annual salary was much higher than during the Qi Refining stage.   But the expenses after Foundation Establishment were by no means comparable to those of the Qi Refining stage.   If it hadn’t been for the two hundred contribution points given by Master Fa Xuan, He was afraid it would have cost almost ten thousand spirit stones to exchange for these Foundation Establishment cultivation skills.   If relying on the annual salary.   It would probably take a regular Foundation Establishment Master several years to save up nearly ten thousand spirit stones like He Song did.   After exchanging for his selected Foundation Establishment cultivation skills, He Song turned around and left.   At the same time in his mind.   He had a clear understanding of the two hundred contribution points bestowed by Master Fa Xuan.   These two hundred contribution points, if carefully calculated, were probably enough to enable a Foundation Establishment Master to quickly gain combat power within ten years.   These two hundred points were worth a full thirty thousand spirit stones.   Such a great gift.   Only a Golden Elixir Master could afford to give it away.   Even now, when He Song owns over a hundred acres of spirit fields as well as a yearly salary of three thousand spirit stones – with a total annual income of over ten thousand spirit stones – he simply can’t afford to give away a gift of thirty thousand spirit stones like Master Fa Xuan can.   With thirty thousand spirit stones.   Even with He Song’s wealth, it would take him two years to save up enough.   He definitely would not give away all the income of two years to others.   Looking towards the main peak where the Thick Earth Sect resided, He Song couldn’t help but sigh.   “Master Fa Xuan is really an interesting man, his skill in winning over people is perfect.”   “Using a Golden Elixir Master’s body to win people over, others might be moved to tears. No wonder he was able to compete against Master Yan Shan.”   “Unfortunately, no matter how much he tries to win people over, when there is danger, I would still run first.”   He shook his head, keeping his inner thoughts hidden.   He Song quickly returned to his own courtyard.   Next.   It was time to practice the new Foundation Establishment cultivation skills he obtained.   In the quiet room.   He Song recalled carefully in his mind and quickly retrieved all the information about the “Thick Earth Formulas” built for the Foundation Establishment.   The first step, undoubtedly, was to switch cultivation skills.   He Song now replaced the Qi Refining stage of the Thick Earth Formulas with the “Thick Earth Formulas” Foundation Establishment chapter.   Only in this way could He Song’s cultivation speed catch up with other Foundation Establishment Masters.   It should be known.   Over the past four years, He Song has been enduring the slow crawling pace of the Qi Refining stage Thick Earth Formulas.   Now that he had the “Thick Earth Formulas” Foundation Establishment chapter in hand, naturally He Song was not going to endure any longer. He immediately began to change his cultivation skills.   Until several days later.   A member of the Artifact Refining Hall delivered a token to the outside of He Song’s courtyard.   This was the token for He Song’s newly opened cave mansion.   At that time, He Song was immersed in changing the “Thick Earth Formulas” Foundation Establishment chapter, so he did not come out.   He just sent out his divine sense to dismiss the other party, then used his divine sense to wrap the token and put it in his top-rank storage bag.   He planned to move after changing his cultivation skill to the “Thick Earth Formulas” Foundation Establishment chapter.   Like this.   Several days passed again.   He Song finally changed the cultivation skill circulating in his body from the original Qi Refining stage Thick Earth Formulas to the “Thick Earth Formulas” Foundation Establishment chapter.   In this way, He Song’s absorption speed of spirit Qi from the outside world, as well as the speed of transforming spirit Qi into mana, finally caught up with other Foundation Establishment Masters.   After changing his cultivation skill, if He Song secluded himself again, he would not be as slow as a turtle’s crawl like those past four years. His cultivation speed, after the change, would experience a huge increase.   So in the future, when secluded.   The increase rate of mana in his body would also greatly increase.    After He Song successfully changed his cultivation skill, he also came out of his seclusion.   Carrying the cave mansion token sent by a disciple of the Artifact Refining Hall a few days ago, He Song left the small courtyard where he had lived for over a decade.   He arrived at a mountain.   Next to the cave mansions of Meng Guan and Wei Fan.   He Song stopped.   This place.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m   Originally it was just a forest.   Although the landscape was quite pleasant, it was rarely trod by people.   However, because Meng Guan chose this place as his cave mansion after Foundation Establishment.   This place had a bit more human activity.   But very quickly, after Wei Fan reached Foundation Establishment, he also opened his cave mansion here.   The two cave mansions side by side like this brought more human activity to the area.   World events are unpredictable.   A few years ago, when Meng Guan and Wei Fan left one after another, the two cave mansions here became deserted.   Until a few days ago.   He Song also chose his cave mansion here, standing side by side with the cave mansions of his two good friends. Only then did this place regain its vitality.   Today.   When He Song arrived.   Seeing his cave mansion standing in line with Meng Guan and Wei Fan’s cave mansions, he felt a sense of satisfaction flash in his eyes.   The three cave mansions arranged in a row were quite to He Song’s liking.   Although at this moment, apart from He Song’s newly opened cave mansion showing a bit of human activity, the other two cave mansions seemed to have been deserted for a long time.   But He Song didn’t care too much.   Opening the cave mansion here was indeed to show off their friendship.   But the main reason is that the two were not in the sect at the moment, so there would be no one to disturb him.   When the two return.   He, besides occasionally staying here, should spend most of his time in the cave mansion he opened outside.   In this way, he didn’t need to worry about being disturbed by the two.   Doing so, he could cultivate without being disturbed and also show off the relationship among the three to the outside world.   It was simply killing two birds with one stone.   After casting a glance over Meng Guan and Wei Fan’s cave mansions, He Song immediately entered his own cave mansion.   The cave mansions that the Thick Earth Sect arranged for Foundation Establishment Masters were very interesting.   Apart from various rooms and furnishings, two array setups were also arranged.   The first one is a Spirit-Gathering Array.   After checking it out, He song showed a disgusted expression on his face.   This Spirit-Gathering Array was still a Miniature Spirit Gathering Array.   Not the small Spirit-Gathering Array that He Song had been using.   However, because the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate was much richer in spirit Qi than the outside world, the concentration of spirit Qi in this cave mansion was still quite good.   Compared with He Song’s original small courtyard, the concentration of spirit Qi here was much stronger.   But it still couldn’t catch up with the cave mansion that He Song opened outside.   Other than the Miniature Spirit-Gathering Array, He Song’s cave mansion also had a Concealing Protection Array.   After a brief contemplation, He Song found the name of this array in the Array Tao Primary Introduction.   Purple Cloud Heavenly Array.   As the name implies, after this array is activated, purple clouds envelop the array, making it effective for keeping divine sense explorations at bay.   At the same time, within the purple clouds, there are protective arrays that can resist attacks from outside the array.   This is an array that has both concealment and protection.   Of course.   Because it has two functions, this implies that the two functions of the array are quite mediocre.   Both concealment and protection cannot match arrays specialized in one aspect.   For example, the concealment ability of the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array can’t match the Smoke Array set up by He Song.   The protective capability of the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array can’t match other arrays specialized in defense..

Chapter 192 - 192: 192: Four Years Later Translator: 549690339   This was also the reason why He Song did not choose to study this array skill initially.   At the same time.   He Song also thought of the conversation he had with Meng Guan and Wei Fan a few years ago about the secrets of the Thick Earth Sect. They were evasive.   With the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array, there should be no need to worry about their conversation getting leaked.   Nevertheless, both of them were still choosing to be evasive. Even though they hinted at it, they never directly spoke about it.     Thinking about this.   The Purple Cloud Heavenly Array’s ability to guard against divine sense might be weak.   For Foundation Establishment Realm masters, the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array’s concealment ability might already be strong.   However, the two of them might have learned some news that the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array’s concealment ability was not as strong for Golden Elixir Realm masters.   “It seems that even though the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array has more functions, its concealment function is not as good as my Smoke Array.” “I was on the right path when I chose to study such a focused array.”   Looking at the location where the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array is set up, He Song felt a sense of relief in his heart.   It was a good thing that he had chosen to study specialized arrays instead of ones like the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array, which can do both but is not proficient in either.   Although they might have a wide range of functions, the power difference between the two is not comparable.   After feeling relieved.   He Song activated the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array and the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array in his cave mansion.   Immediately.   The surrounding spirit Qi began to converge toward He Song’s cave mansion.   Above He Song’s cave mansion, purple clouds filled the sky and shielded it from view.   After the sky was covered with purple clouds, He Song entered the meditation room in his cave mansion.   After moving.   Naturally, he continued to cultivate his newly acquired Foundation Establishment Skill.   Upon entering the meditation room.   Feeling the density of the spirit Qi around him rapidly increasing. He Song quickly immersed himself in the cultivation of his Foundation Establishment Skill.   Having changed his Foundation Establishment cultivation skill.   Next.   He Song considered for a moment and then set his sights on offensive skills.   Earth Dragon Skill.   Thick Earth Seal.   After weighing the options between these two offensive skills, He Song finally chose to study the Thick Earth Seal first.   The Thick Earth Seal is a secret skill that Foundation Establishment Realm masters of the Thick Earth Sect basically all learn.   It’s not because the Thick Earth Seal is too common.   Rather, it’s because of the great power of the Thick Earth Seal, which can be used offensively and defensively. Naturally, it also significantly increases the strength of Foundation Establishment realm cultivators.   Secret skills that are based on seals.   Usually, have immense power.   Naturally, they also consume a lot of mana.   Therefore, even if they have learned the Thick Earth Seal, they generally use it as a trump card.   It will not be used easily.   For regular combat, He Song chose the Earth Dragon Skill.   However, now is not the time to cultivate the Earth Dragon Skill.   First, learn the Thick Earth Seal, and then study the Earth Dragon Skill.   This is the order He Song has set for himself.   After completing the study of these two offensive skills, he will start learning other skills.   He Song immersed himself in the process of cultivating skills.   Time.   Quietly passed as he cultivated his skills.   In a blink of an eye.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m   Four years had passed.    During these four years, He Song had cultivated the Thick Earth Seal to the point where he could use it freely without losing power.   He also cultivated the Earth Dragon Skill to the point where he could use it freely without losing power.   However, just after He Song had practiced both offensive skills to proficiency.   His gaze turned to the Thick Earth Sect’s Book Collection Pavilion once again.   “Phantom Escaping Skill, Fire-Melting Shield, and Dust Cloak Skill, these three skills can be left for later study.”   “When I was browsing the Foundation Establishment skills on the second floor of the Book Collection Pavilion earlier, there were a few other skills I need urgently.”   “First, learn those skills and then turn back to study these three.” Nowadays.   After learning these two offensive skills for the Foundation Establishment realm.   He Song’s offensive capabilities are sufficient.   In the course of these four years, the spirit amulets on his body have also been gradually replaced with Foundation Establishment level Defense Spirit Amulets.   His defensive capabilities have been similarly enhanced.   Even the two artifacts on his body, one for offense and one for defense, have already been purchased from the Artifact Refining Hall using contribution points to acquire new high-quality artifacts.   However, due to time constraints.   And no need to leave the sect.   He Song did not choose to refine the two newly replaced high-quality artifacts.   Under such circumstances.   All he needs to do now is refine the two high-quality artifacts on his body to have Foundation Establishment realm combat power.   At that time, what he’ll lack will not only be offensive and defensive capabilities.   But also some auxiliary skills.   For example.   The Breath Concealment Skill which can block the observation of Spirit Vision Skill and completely hide a cultivator’s breath.   The Qi Observing Skill that can see through the concealment of Breath Concealment Formulas and has various additional effects.   The Soul Searching Skill that can view other people’s memories and cause severe pain.   The Sealing Skill that can completely seal people or objects. Without a correct solution or cultivation not higher than his own, one cannot break the seal.   The Soul Splitting Skill that can cause severe pain to enemies and is specifically used for torturing people.   Being able…   Upon reaching the Foundation Establishment realm.   His abilities were now much more numerous than when he was in the Qi Refining stage.   When He Song searched for Foundation Establishment techniques in the Book Collection Pavilion’s second floor before, he often saw various types of techniques like the ones mentioned earlier.   Some of these techniques were.   Yin, common, cruel, and even some that could save cultivators a lot of trouble.   He Song naturally wouldn’t let go of these auxiliary techniques.   Especially the Soul Searching Skill.   This skill, which could be used to view an enemy’s memories, was exactly what He Song had in mind.   You should know.   Before this, he had missed several chances.   If he had the Soul Searching Skill at that time, maybe those missed opportunities would have fallen into He Song’s hands.   It’s a pity.   Such a pity.   But it’s okay now.   After successfully establishing his foundation, if he encounters that kind of situation again in the future, with just one Soul Searching Skill, He Song would be able to know everything he wants to know. He wouldn’t miss any more opportunities.   Thus.   Four years later, He Song’s figure appeared in the Book Collection Pavilion once again.   Entering the Book Collection Pavilion.   He was still greeted by Yang Yan.   But this time He Song had no intention of chatting with him.   After greeting him, He Song immediately went up to the second floor, took all the auxiliary techniques he remembered in his mind, and held them in his hands.   He then went into the quiet room in the Book Collection Pavilion and imprinted all the auxiliary techniques he had chosen into his mind.   Skill, Soul Splitting Skill.   A total of five auxiliary techniques.   After imprinting these five auxiliary techniques into his memory.    He Song quickly returned to his cave mansion.   Sitting cross-legged in the quiet room.   He Song closed his eyes slightly, and the introduction of the Breath Concealment Skill quickly flashed through his mind.   The Breath Concealment Skill is not the same as the Breath Concealment Formulas.   The Breath Concealment Formulas are only for the Qi Refining stage.   It can deceive Qi Refining stage cultivators, but it can’t deceive the divine sense scanning of Foundation Establishment Masters.   Although ordinary Qi Refining stage cultivators wouldn’t be scanned by a Foundation Establishment Master’s divine sense.   But if a Foundation Establishment Master really wants to know your cultivation level and uses divine sense scanning, the Breath Concealment Formulas wouldn’t be able to block it.   Only the Breath Concealment Skill, an auxiliary technique of the Foundation Establishment Realm, can block the divine sense scanning.   Of course.   If you don’t resist, the divine sense scanning can naturally also be detected by the caster, but the cultivation -level perceived would be the one the caster wants to show.   For example, He Song is currently in the early Foundation Establishment stage.   If he uses the Breath Concealment Skill to hide his cultivation at the Qi Refining Early Stage.   In this case, whether others use the Qi Refining stage’s Spirit Vision Skill or the Foundation Establishment Realm’s Qi Observing Skill, they would see the Qi Refining Early Stage.   Even if they use divine sense scanning, they can only see that He Song’s cultivation is at the Qi Refining Early Stage.   In this way.   The strength of the Breath Concealment Skill can be seen.   The functions of Foundation Establishment Realm auxiliary techniques are indeed much stronger than those of the Qi Refining stage skills.   At the same time.   Besides the Breath Concealment Skill.   The appearance of the Qi Observing Skill also allows Foundation Establishment stage cultivators to see through the hiding of Qi Refining stage cultivators.   After practicing the Qi Observing Skill, Foundation Establishment Masters can see through the hiding of Qi Refining stage cultivators who use the Breath Concealment Formulas.   This is also the reason why He Song didn’t dare to show his face in front of other Foundation Establishment Masters when he entered Green Wall Immortal City four years ago.   At that time, He Song.   It had only been four years since he broke through to Foundation Establishment.   And he hadn’t learned the Breath Concealment Skill yet, so even though his cultivation was in the Foundation Establishment Realm, he could only use the Breath Concealment Formulas, which couldn’t resist the probing of the Qi Observing Skill.   As a result, in order to hide his cultivation, he could only hide himself and not attract the attention of Foundation Establishment Masters.   Of course, the Qi Observing Skill can see through Breath Concealment Formulas.   But it can’t see through the Breath Concealment Skill.   Although the Qi Observing Skill doesn’t seem as powerful as the Breath Concealment Skill.   However, the Qi Observing Skill is not only used to observe other cultivators’ cultivation.   Elixir refinement requires the Qi Observing Skill.   Artifact refinement also requires the Qi Observing Skill.   Some things that require the use of vision generally require the Qi Observing Skill.   This auxiliary skill can be said to be a must-have skill for Foundation Establishment Masters.   After reading the introductions of the Breath Concealment Skill and the Qi Observing Skill, He Song thought for a moment and soon immersed himself in the practice of these two auxiliary techniques.   In He Song’s view, the Breath Concealment Skill and Qi Observing Skill must be learned as soon as possible.   As for the reason.   He Song is an everlasting being.   As an everlasting being, his cultivation progress naturally cannot be the same as that of ordinary Foundation Establishment Masters.   Therefore, he needs to rely on the Breath Concealment Skill to hide himself so as not to be noticed by others for being abnormal.   Although using the Breath Concealment Skill all the time would seem strange, it is still more dangerous to expose one’s cultivation progress to others. Only by keeping others in the dark about their specific cultivation.   Can one’s safety be truly guaranteed.   After all.   If one’s cultivation remains in the early stages of Foundation Establishment and doesn’t advance, it would also draw the disdain of others.   Instead of that.   It’s better to hide one’s cultivation and keep others from knowing.   Of course, the most important point is.   With the Breath Concealment Skill.   He Song can hide his cultivation and go to various Immortal Pavilions for trading.   He will no longer attract the attention of the Foundation Establishment Masters guarding the Immortal Pavilion because of his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation.   In this way.   When He Song doesn’t need to worry about being discovered by the Master Guardian of the Immortal Pavilion.   He would no longer have to come and go in a hurry when dealing with spirit rice or spirit medicine for fear of being hunted down like before..

Chapter 193 - 193: 193: The Four Great Masters Translator: 549690339   Although this could possibly bring about some unnecessary troubles.   Such as being targeted, leading to assassination attempts.   But He Song is now a Foundation Establishment Master, these are mere inconveniences that he was not even afraid of during the Qi Refining stage, let alone now?ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m   With the cultivation base of the Foundation Establishment Realm, bullying those who wish to kill and seize treasures, He Song is not under any psychological pressure.   When at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.     Master Cheng Shan held the sixth rank.   Now that he has reached Foundation Establishment.   He can naturally do such things.   After all.   He who kills.   Must be killed in return.   For such a risk-free matter, He Song naturally wouldn’t feel any pressure.   He Song is cautious.   But not weak.   He simply wanted to steadily increase his strength in comfort.   Not to be a pushover who puts up with everything.   If someone wants to kill him.   Then he retaliates.   However, even in killing a rabbit, a lion will exert its full strength. When retaliating, he needs to utterly annihilate the opponent, erase all traces.   Without letting anyone know that he did it.   That’s all there is to it.   As long as no one can trace it back to him from those clues.   Then this matter was not his doing.   Moreover, He Song is now a Foundation Establishment Master and has the backing of the Thick Earth Sect.   He’s not likely to lose his head in handling general crises.   Having considered all this, He Song let his divine sense probe out, checking the massive amount of spirit rice in his storage bag, feeling a touch of helplessness.   The spirit rice he was carrying.   Just kept increasing.   The hundred acres of spirit fields he’d created outside, coupled with the dozens of acres of spirit fields and medicine garden next to his cave mansion in the Thick Earth Sect.   Combined, these fields and gardens could yield tens of thousands of pounds of spirit rice per year for He Song, and even some spirit medicine.   Tens of thousands of pound of spirit rice.   It doesn’t seem like much.   However, if you rack up tens of thousands of pound of spirit rice every year.   It does take up a lot of space.   “No way, this spirit rice is taking up too much space, and it takes too long to sell it off, which could rouse suspicion.”   “I need to find a way to change the way I acquire spirit stones.”   “Or, after my next secluded cultivation, I’ll take all this spirit rice to other sects outside the Thick Earth Sect to sell.”   Looking at the massive amount of spirit rice in his storage bag, He Song felt a headache and could only make a resolution to find a new way to procure spirit stones.   Or after he learns all the skills in his possession, as a Foundation   Establishment Master, he’ll go to other sect sects’ territories to sell spirit rice.   Presumably, as a Foundation Establishment, He Song should be able to handle this without incident.   Earlier, while He Song was constantly selling spirit rice in the Thick Earth Sect’s territory.   He Song had sharply noticed that the Thick Earth Sect had begun to notice the   sigmncant amount 01 spirit rice appearmg m Its territory.   They just hadn’t taken any specific action yet.   But during the four years he spent in seclusion learning his skills within the Thick Earth Sect, once when he went to the Foreign Affairs Hall, seeking news from the outside world.    He accidentally discovered a mission from his sect to investigate into the matter.   Upon learning the mission had suddenly appeared several years ago and remained uncompleted, He Song’s wariness immediately reached its peak.   Therefore, he became hesitant about selling spirit rice.   That’s also why he had so much spirit rice on him.   The Thick Earth Sect had started investigating the source of the spirit rice He Song had previously sold.   If he were to start selling spirit rice in large quantities within the Thick Earth Sect’s territory at this point, he’d most likely be investigated by the sect.   Although He Song is currently a Foundation Establishment elder of the Thick Earth Sect.   If this practice were discovered, his talent in array tao would likely be exposed instantly.   At that point.   Who knows what other complications might arise.   In order to avoid exposing himself in front of everyone, He Song didn’t sell any spirit rice in recent years, instead storing all the harvested spirit rice in his storage bag.   Luckily, he had just acquired a top-rank storage bag, or he wouldn’t have been able to fit so much spirit rice.   Setting these thoughts aside.   He Song soon became engrossed in practicing Breath Concealment Skill and Qi Observing Skill.   Breath Concealment Skill.   Qi Observing Skill.   And Soul Searching Skill.   He made a priority of learning these three skills.   The Breath Concealment Skill shields cultivation levels.   Qi Observing Skill sees through the opponent’s cultivation level.   The Soul Searching Skill helps in attaining serendipities.   If He Song wanted to sell spirit rice outside of the Thick Earth Sect’s territory.   While he’s out, he would certainly have to use these three skills frequently.   However.   Just when He Song was immersed in practicing these skills.   A great incident occurred outside.   The headquarters of the Seven Star Sect.   A Golden Elixir Master from the Nascent Soul Upper Sect traveled a long distance to meet Master Yan Shan, who had been guarding outside the Seven Star Sect’s gate.   Then, through the Seven Star Sect’s Sect Protection Array, he requested the Seven Star Sect’s Master Tian Shu to close the Sect Protection Array.   When the Seven Star Sect’s Sect Protection Array was closed.   The Golden Elixir Master of the Nascent Soul Upper Sect, along with Master Yan Shan and Master Tian Shu, had a lengthy discussion outside the gates of the Seven Star Sect.   During this time.   The Sect Protection Array of the Thick Earth Sect was activated, and Master Fa Xuan rapidly headed towards the gates of the Seven Star Sect.   By the time Master Fa Xuan arrived.   Outside the gates of the Seven Star Sect.   A strange sight occurred.   The four Golden Elixir Masters sat atop a mountain, discussing the tao. Their overwhelming spiritual pressure spread around them, preventing anyone from getting close to the mountain peak where they were located.   The four sat together, the subject of their discussion was unknown.   The Foundation Establishment Masters and Qi-refining cultivators who were excluded from the discussion could only faintly see the figures of the four.   But they couldn’t hear even a whisper of their conversation.   The discussion between the four Golden Elixir Masters lasted for three days.   Three days later.   Master Tian Shu of Seven Star Sect seemed to be infuriated and stood up as if ready to take action.   But under the pressure of Master Fa Xuan and Master Yan Shan, he didn’t make a move.   Instead, he sat back down after a moment of standoff under the mediation of another Golden Elixir Master.   Seeing this.   Master Fa Xuan and Master Yan Shan also took their seats again.   What followed.   Was further discussion.    Until several days later.   The Golden Elixir Master from the Nascent Soul Upper Sect was the first to leave.   Despite his frustration, Master Tian Shu restrained his anger. After bidding the two Golden Elixir Masters of the Thick Earth Sect farewell, he turned and returned to the nearby gates of the Seven Star Sect.   Immediately after.   Inside the gates of the Seven Star Sect, all the elders and disciples of Seven Star Sect began to pack up their belongings.   A few days later.   Under the leadership of Master Tian Shu, all the elders and disciples of the Seven Star Sect solemnly set off for the distance from the location of the Seven Star Sect’s gate.   From then on.   The war between the Thick Earth Sect and the Seven Star Sect.   Came to an end with the moving of the entire Seven Star Sect.   The two Golden Elixir Masters of Thick Earth Sect, after the relocation of the Seven Star Sect, immediately entered the gates of the Seven Star Sect. No one knew what the two Golden Elixir Masters did in the Seven Star Sect thereafter.   However, when the two Golden Elixir Masters left the Seven Star Sect, they immediately ordered the sealing of the gates of the Seven Star Sect, forbidding anyone from entering or exiting.   After that, the two returned to the Thick Earth Sect.   As for the distribution of the spoils of war after the two returned to the Thick Earth Sect, He Song had no news of it.   However.   Years after parting ways.   Meng Guan and Wei Fan finally returned to Thick Earth Sect from Mountain Immortal City.   At this point.   Only two years had passed since He Song immersed himself in the practice of the Breath Concealment Skill and the Qi Observing Skill.   He Song, at present.   Only just managed to train the Breath Concealment Skill to a level where he could freely use it without any loss of power.   As for the Qi Observing Skill, he hasn’t had the chance to start practicing yet.   At this moment.   It was He Song’s sixth year since he returned to the Thick Earth Sect.   He had not yet had the chance to refine the two high-quality artifacts he recently acquired, nor had he had the opportunity to train all the new skills he acquired to the level where he could use them freely without losing any power.   He had also not yet found a new way to obtain spirit stones.   However.   When Meng Guan and Wei Fan finally returned to the Thick Earth Sect after many years, He Song still emerged from his seclusion to meet them both.   At the gates of Thick Earth Sect.   He Song invited Meng Guan and Wei Fan, who had just returned from   Mountain Immortal City, into his cave mansion.   As aroma of tea began to diffuse in He Song’s cave mansion.   Meng Guan, sitting opposite He Song, had a hint of emotion on his face.   “When you achieved Foundation Establishment, I was unable to return and protect you. It was helpless. Fortunately, you managed to establish foundation successfully, thereby relieving me of some worry.”   Upon seeing He Song who had already reached the early stages of the Foundation Establishment, joy could hardly be concealed in Meng Guan’s eyes.   He, along with Wei Fan, now have He Song.   A total of three Foundation Establishment Cultivators.   He had once thought that if his good friend could also reach the Foundation Establishment, it would provide more support on the path from Foundation Establishment to Golden Elixir in the future.   However, although he was daring enough, he only dared to hope that one of his good friends could successfully establish a foundation.   If one friend could establish a foundation, then they could support each other and travel further on the Immortal Path.   But to his surprise.   Wei Fan successfully established foundation.   He Song also successfully established foundation.   All three of them were good friends and all successfully established foundations.   Such odds were rare in the world!   Seeing He Song at the early stages of Foundation Establishment, Meng Guan felt extremely gratified, and his face broke into a wider smile.   Aside.   Upon hearing Meng Guan say this, Wei Fan immediately nodded in agreement.   “It’s a joy that you could establish a foundation, considering the urgency of the war, we were certainly regretful for not being able to return.”   “However, now that the war has ceased, we must celebrate your achievement, you must not refuse.”   The two were first apologetic.   Then they clearly planned the celebration for He Song’s establishment of foundation..

Chapter 194 - 194: 194: Mid-stage Foundation Establishment Translator: 549690339   However, seeing this situation, He Song shook his head repeatedly.   Celebration?   Is Foundation Establishment really worth celebrating?   Then, when he reaches the Golden Elixir or Yuanying stage in the future… wouldn’t he have to announce it to the whole world?   For just thinking about this attention-seeking matter, He Song felt like he was being watched by countless people, and that his secrets would be exposed in just a few minutes.     For someone as cautious as He Song a-   Less attention-seeking like this, the fewer the better, ideally none at all.   “It’s thanks to the support of my two friends that I could establish my foundation.”   “It’s just a small matter, there’s no need to be so concerned.”   “Today, I specifically came out to meet my two friends, not to celebrate building my foundation.”   “The path to cultivation is long; building a small foundation is hardly worth mentioning. ”   “As for the celebration, you two better not bring it up again.”   After quickly rejecting the goodwill of his two friends, He Song casually poured them each a cup of tea.   Then, his gaze turned to Meng Guan.   During this time of welcoming his friends back to the sect,   He always felt that there was something slightly off about Meng Guan.   But he couldn’t pinpoint exactly what it was.   And it wasn’t appropriate to use his divine sense to investigate.   Therefore, when needing to change the subject, revealing his doubts became He Song’s first choice.   “By the way, since the beginning, I’ve sensed that there’s something wrong with Lao Meng; was he injured on the frontline?”   One is to change the topic.   The second is to satisfy his curiosity.   He Song quickly asked what he was thinking, and his gaze followed to Meng   Guan.   Meng Guan’s unusual behavior was indeed puzzling to him.   From the surface, there were no injuries on Meng Guan.   Moreover, there were no external signs caused by injuries.   But He Song always felt that something was wrong when he looked at him.   However, just as He Song voiced his doubts,   On one side,   Wei Fan and Meng Guan looked at each other, with a hint of strangeness flashing across their faces.   After a round of eyebrow communication,   In the end, it was still Wei Fan who spoke first.   “Fellow Daoist, you worry too much; Lao Meng hasn’t been injured.”   “But, you may not Imow, in the fifteen years since we were ordered to go to the   Mountain Immortal City, Lao Meng’s reputation has been quite impressive.”   “Before that, his dharma title, Master Duan Hun, had been revered among Qi Refining Masters in the Seven Star Sect.”   “It wasn’t until I went there that I realized how great Lao Meng’s reputation is.”   “Over the years, Lao Meng has gained quite a bit from his time on the frontlines.”   “Later, he even went to the territory controlled by the Seven Star Sect and made a fortune.”   “As a result… his cultivation base has surpassed ours by a bit.”   “He has reached the mid-stage Foundation Establishment.”   At this point,   It seemed that He Song’s expression was somewhat off,   Wei Fan quickly explained with another sentence.   “What you sensed that’s unusual about him should be the spiritual pressure caused by the mid-stage Foundation Establishment.”    “He only recently broke through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment, and his control over his own strength is still not that strong.”   With a casual wave, Wei Fan spoke, a hint of envy appearing in his gaze toward Meng Guan.   Mid-stage Foundation Establishment.   He had already broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm for more than ten years, but he hadn’t even touched the threshold of the mid-stage Foundation Establishment stage.   But what about Meng Guan?   In just over twenty years since breaking through to Foundation Establishment, he had successfully broken through to the mid-stage.   Such a rapid breakthrough speed made Wei Fan, someone with four spirits roots, feel incredible.   After all,   He, Wei Fan, had four spirits roots.   As for Meng Guan? Meng Guan only had five spirits roots.   During the Qi Refining stage, Meng Guan managed to risk his life with his five spirits roots qualification and succeeded in entering the Foundation   Establishment Realm without relying on a Foundation Establishment Elixir or Foundation Establishment insights.   He, a cultivator with four spirits roots, also had a Foundation Establishment Elixir and Foundation Establishment insights, but he still failed once before entering the Foundation Establishment Realm.   At the Foundation Establishment Realm, Meng Guan raised his cultivation base to the Qi-refining mid-stage in just a few decades.   And what about him?   Now, Wei Fan had also been at the Foundation Establishment for more than ten years, but he hadn’t even touched the threshold of the mid-stage Foundation Establishment.   Comparing the two… the jealousy in Wei Fan’s heart could only be imagined.   At the same time, Wei Fan was sure that there must be secrets on Meng Guan.   Otherwise, Meng Guan’s cultivation would not have progressed so quickly.   However,   Which cultivator doesn’t have some secrets?   Meng Guan’s cultivation has now reached the mid-stage Foundation Establishment, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to keep his secrets.   If someone truly wants to investigate,   They might end up knocking out their own teeth.   As for Wei Fan,   Although he was envious, Meng Guan was his close friend; the higher Meng Guan’s cultivation base, the better it was for him.   There was no need for him to covet anything. As Meng Guan’s cultivation improved quickly,   Wei Fan’s cultivation shouldn’t be far behind either.   After all,   As they pushed on to the Seven Star Sect’s core territories and incorporated the Immortal Pavilion into the Thick Earth Sect’s control,   He was also part of the accompanying personnel, receiving no small amount of resources.   rie WdS connue11L L11dL Ills CUILIVdL1011 speeu WOCuu soon duvdllce LO Lile nexL level.   “Mid-stage Foundation Establishment?”   “He advanced to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment so quickly?”   “It seems that Lao Meng has gained a lot in the Mountain Immortal City over the years.”   “Wei has also heard that some years ago, he fought all the way to the lair of the   Seven Star Sect.”   “It looks like I missed a lot of opportunities by breaking through the   Foundation Establishment Realm a few years later.”   Off to the side,   After hearing Wei Fan’s words, He Song wore a stunned look on his face.   Even his words deliberately expressed his surprise.   At the same time, there was a hint of regret for not having seized the opportunity.   However, deep down,   He was not too surprised by Meng Guan’s breakthrough to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment.   As early as when Meng Guan was still at the Qi-refining late stage and had not yet entered the Foundation Establishment Realm, He Song had sensed that there might be a secret on Meng Guan.   Otherwise, how could a Five Spirits Roots cultivator advance his cultivation from the seventh-tier Qi Refining to Qi Refining great perfection in just over a decade?   At that time, he did not think about what kind of secret it could be.   But He Song already had expectations in his heart.    Moreover, Meng Guan’s rapid rise in cultivation seemed to be inextricably linked to the wars.   Therefore, when he learned that Meng Guan’s cultivation had broken through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment, He Song became more certain of his previous guess.   There must be something that allows him to advance his cultivation rapidly in war.   However, due to limited information, He Song could not surmise what it could be.   Nonetheless, He Song did not have any curiosity about Meng Guan’s secret.   Which cultivator doesn’t have some secrets?   At the very least, those who can become cultivators would possess cultivation skills that can integrate Qi into their bodies.   Such skills were also considered secrets when they were still mortal.   Perhaps before entering the Cultivation World, they received the legacy of a predecessor and gained many benefits from it.   If one were to obtain the legacy of a Foundation Establishment Master,   Then perhaps the path of cultivation during the Qi Refining stage would be smooth.   Those cultivators who search everywhere for opportunities are not uncommon even within the Thick Earth Sect.   There are Foundation Establishment legacies, Qi Refining legacies, and perhaps various other opportunities.   If all the secrets within them were revealed, it would likely cause a huge uproar within the Thick Earth Sect.   Upon their death, cultivators would often leave their lifelong gains to their successors.   This is why there are so many people in the Cultivation World who are eager to find opportunities.   The secret on Meng Guan may also be related to these opportunities.   As for where it came from,   He Song didn’t know.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com   “Fellow Daoist, don’t be disheartened. Although such destructive wars are rare, our sect is strong and there may be more in the future.”   “At that time, perhaps you can still gain more opportunities.”   Seeing the regret on He Song’s face, Meng Guan immediately offered some comforting words.   He thought that He Song was regretting not having seized an opportunity.   Little did he know,   Even if the Thick Earth Sect were to launch another war for extermination, He Song would not go to the battlefield. He might even run away on the spot.   With He Song’s caution,   Even if it meant giving up the so-called opportunity, he would not participate in any war of extermination.   Of course,   He Song just laughed at Meng Guan’s words of comfort and then moved on to another topic.   Next, He Song, Wei Fan, and Meng Guan enjoyed a feast in He Song’s cave mansion.   The two men occasionally discussed war information between the Thick Earth   Sect and the Seven Star Sect,   As well as various incidents they encountered in the Mountain Immortal City.   This included the recent events surrounding the four Golden Elixir Masters’ discussions.   He Song listened with great interest.   But after several days had passed, the three of them, although having a great time, returned to their respective cave mansions. When Meng Guan and Wei Fan each returned to their cave mansions,   He Song activated the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array,   Changed the tea on the table,   And then,   He sat down by the table, his face showing a thoughtful expression. Meng Guan and Wei Fan had already returned to the sect.   Other Thick Earth Sect Foundation Establishment Masters should have returned too.   However, there should still be some Foundation Establishment Masters from the Thick Earth Sect left in the territory previously occupied by the Seven Star Sect.   Those areas were now under the control of the Thick Earth Sect, and it was only natural for them to stay behind and take control.   But, would the other sects around the Thick Earth Sect and Seven Star Sect just sit by and watch the Seven Star Sect move and the Thick Earth Sect’s power double?   Would they not be afraid that once the Thick Earth Sect had expanded its territory and enhanced its foundation, it would wage war against them and take over their lands?   Why didn’t they support the Seven Star Sect?   Logically speaking, the Seven Star Sect had existed for thousands or even tens of thousands of years and should have had one or two allies, right? Even if the Seven Star Sect was a Demon Sect, it should have allies.   Furthermore,   Why did the Golden Elixir Master from the Nascent Soul Upper Sect come to the Seven Star Sect’s entrance at this time, and why did Master Tian Shu of the Seven Star Sect activate the Sect Protection Array?   In the end, what exactly did the four Golden Elixir Masters discuss during their sit-down?   why did master than shu of the seven star sect feel compelled to take action, yet, due to the overpowering strength of the two Golden Elixir Masters from the Thick Earth Sect, he could only helplessly sit back down?   What exactly did they talk about?

Chapter 195 - 195: 195: Golden Elixir Skill Means Translator: 549690339   Why has the Seven Star Sect, after the discussions among the Four Great Masters, decided to move their entire sect under the order of Master Tian Shu?   Isn’t this act of giving up their territory a bit too sudden?   Can the Thick Earth Sect really just watch the Seven Star Sect leave?   Don’t they need to eradicate them completely?   What are the two Golden Elixir Masters of the Thick Earth Sect planning deep down?     Where will the disciples of the Seven Star Sect go?   In the blink of an eye, He Song’s mind was filled with doubts.   However, because he did not participate in this war nor did he join the discussions among the Four Great Golden Elixir Masters,   Therefore,   He didn’t know much about these matters.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m   The truth was also beyond his reach.   He Song, who had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm but had not yet formed the combat power of a Foundation Establishment Master,   Needed a few more years to truly possess the power of a Foundation Establishment Master.   Before that, the source of information regarding these matters was rather limited for He Song.   To unravel these mysteries, he could only rely on slowly obtaining more information in the future.   After pondering for a long time in his cave mansion,   He Song sighed and looked at the mountain where the Thick Earth Sect’s main peak was located with a deep gaze.   For some reason,   Although the scope of the Thick Earth Sect’s territory has doubled this time and the two Golden Elixir Masters were highly prestigious,   He Song, who was within the Thick Earth Sect, couldn’t shake an unreal feeling.   This sect war,   Was it too easy?   The attitudes of other Golden Core Sects and the Nascent Soul Upper Sect behind the Seven Star Sect were also very strange.   Moreover, with the Seven Star Sect already conquered,   Would there be any friction between the two factions of the Thick Earth Sect regarding the distribution of their gains?   After pondering with a frown for a moment,   He Song simply got up and quickly left his cave mansion.   Instead of thinking so much,   He might as well imprint all the Foundation Establishment methods from the Thick Earth Sect’s Book Collection Pavilion into his memory one by one.   Only by learning all these methods would his cultivation in the Foundation Establishment Realm continue to be smooth.   At that time,   Even if anything should happen to the Thick Earth Sect, He Song wouldn’t have to worry about his cultivation in the Foundation Establishment Realm with those methods in hand.   As for the Golden Elixir Realm methods,   He needed to try if he could obtain them.   He Song’s eyes were profound, and he had already begun to make plans for his future.   As for this Thick Earth Sect,   He didn’t know how long he could stay here.   Soon,   He Song arrived at the Book Collection Pavilion.   The one who received him was still Yang Yan.   After greeting him, He Song went up to the second floor.   On the second floor of the Book Collection Pavilion,   He Song’s gaze swept over the jade slips, constantly considering which methods he might need if he were to become a Loose Cultivator in the future.    At the same time, his gaze moved to the stairs leading from the second to the third floor of the Book Collection Pavilion.   The first floor had Qi Refining stage methods,   The second floor had Foundation Establishment Realm methods,   And the third floor should hold the Golden Elixir Realm methods, right?   With no one guarding this place, could he just go straight to the third floor and pick some Golden Elixir Realm methods?   A bold idea flashed through his mind, and He Song hesitated for a moment.   In the end, he decided to imprint the Foundation Establishment Realm methods he needed into his memory first, then directly ask Yang Yan later on. Although he was now a Foundation Establishment Master,   To others, a newly promoted Foundation Establishment Master setting his sights on Golden Elixir methods was clearly not normal behavior.   Besides, even though the third floor of the Book Collection Pavilion appeared to be unguarded, perhaps the guard was just hidden too well.   The Book Collection Pavilion of a Golden Core Sect was of utmost importance,   It was impossible that only Yang Yan, a Qi Refining stage disciple, would be guarding it.   Therefore,   After weighing his options, He Song naturally made a more prudent choice.   After selecting several Foundation Establishment Realm methods that he might need in the future, as well as some other Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth, He Song took the jade slips and went downstairs.   After imprinting these methods and Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth into his memory in the quiet room of the Book Collection Pavilion,   He Song exchanged a few words with Yang Yan.   During their conversation, He Song casually asked,   “Mr. Yang, do you know if the Book Collection Pavilion has any Golden Elixir methods? Lately, I’ve been obsessed with studying methods, and I wonder if I could borrow them for a while?”   He Song and Yang Yan should have addressed each other as uncle and nephew.   However, due to He Song repeatedly visiting the Book Collection Pavilion, imprinting one Foundation Establishment method after another into his memory,   And constantly interacting with Yang Yan,   Their relationship naturally got a bit closer.   In this way, Yang Yan would be more likely to tell He Song everything he knew.   He Song had always been generous in gaining advantages when it came to using his words.   After all, it was just a formality.   He wasn’t too concerned about it.   “He Senior Brother, do you want to borrow Golden Elixir methods?”   Upon hearing this, Yang Yan, who was recording something, looked surprised and stared at He Song in astonishment.   But soon, he showed a sudden realization, recalling the reason why He Song had been constantly visiting the Book Collection Pavilion to buy Foundation Establishment techniques in recent years.   Since He Song frequented this place, many visits would naturally attract attention from others.   Therefore, he casually made up a reason and dispelled Yang Yan’s doubts.   The reason He Song gave initially was that he was fascinated by the study of Foundation Establishment skills, and he wanted to learn as many as possible, hoping to create a unique secret technique in the future.   Such a reason managed to fool Yang Yan, making him believe that He Song truly wanted to create a unique secret technique.   “I’m afraid that won’t work. Although I can understand He Song’s desire to create a secret technique, the stairway between the second and third floors is covered by Array Skills, with a Foundation Establishment elder guarding it.”   “To enter, one needs a Sect Leader’s token.”   “So…”   In the end, Yang Yan spread his hands, his face showing a trace of helplessness.   He had been in the Book Collection Pavilion for many years, but he had never seen anyone go to the third floor.   Of course, he was powerless to help He Song with his desire to study the Golden Elixir Skill Means.   Although he felt that He Song’s chances of creating Foundation Establishment secret techniques might increase after studying the Golden Elixir Skill Means.   But the Golden Elixir Skill Means was not something anyone could see.   Even the Foundation Establishment elders within the sect were no exception. “So that’s how it is. Thank you, Mr. Yang. I’ll leave first.”   Seeing that he wouldn’t be able to catch a glimpse of the Golden Elixir Skill Means, He Song lost the desire to stay here any longer.   After bidding farewell to Yang Yan, He Song’s figure quickly returned to his cave mansion.   Once again, he activated the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array.   He Song entered seclusive cultivation once more.   However, this time,    He Song did not study the Foundation Establishment techniques he had recently acquired, nor did he study the ones he had obtained before.   On the contrary,   This time, in his seclusion, He Song focused his attention on the two high-quality Artifacts he had purchased earlier.   After breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, He Song bought two Artifacts for himself at the Thick Earth Sect’s Artifact Refining Hall.   One for offense and one for defense.   A seal and a shield.   The seal was called Black Tiger.   It was made from a Foundation Establishment Realm Black Tiger bone and various precious materials, possessing great power.   Once activated, it could control the Black Tiger to attack the enemy.   At the same time, the Black Tiger Seal itself could freely grow and shrink, advancing to kill the enemy and retreating to protect oneself.   For such an artifact, He Song had spent a great deal of money, a full hundred or more contribution points, to purchase it from the Thick Earth Sect’s Artifact Refining Hall.   This was a high-quality artifact that could be used for both offense and defense, and it could also be combined with He Song’s Earth Dragon Skill.   The Black Tiger controlled by the Black Tiger Seal, coupled with the Earth Dragon controlled by the Earth Dragon Skill, the two complementing each other, in addition to He Song’s support on the periphery, was equivalent to the combat power of three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.   In this way, whether it was killing enemies or escaping, there would be a higher margin for error.   Moreover, the Black Tiger Seal itself was also capable of killing enemies, making it a perfect combination.   Furthermore, He Song also purchased an extra mana shield.   With the mana shield protecting him, He Song’s safety could be somewhat guaranteed.   The mana shield is called Green Water Tortoise Shell Shield.   It was made from the Foundation Establishment Realm Green Water Tortoise Shell and several precious materials.   It had excellent protective capabilities against water-based spells.   On its own, it was extremely sturdy, effectively protecting cultivators within.   At the same time,   If it was stimulated by mana, the Green Water Tortoise Shell Shield could emit a turtle shadow, enveloping the cultivator’s entire body, and possessing an incredibly strong defensive ability.   This turtle shadow provided an all -round protection, blocking attacks from all directions.   The Green Water Tortoise Shell Shield was also quite expensive.   Although not as expensive as the Black Tiger Seal, it still cost He Song more than 80 contribution points.   A full 80 or more contribution points.   Converted into spirit stones,   A full 10,000 or more spirit stones.   The price of a high-quality Artifact is generally around 10,000 spirit stones.   Of course, rarer high-quality Artifacts would naturally be more expensive.   Judging by the price of the two high-quality Artifacts that He Song had bought, their power would naturally be even greater among high-quality Artifacts.   Refining these two high-quality Artifacts,   For He Song, it was neither difficult nor too easy.   Two years.   It took He Song a full two years,   to completely refine these two high-quality Artifacts so that they could be used freely without diminishing their power in the slightest.   His cultivation also grew steadily, with the mana in his body increased significantly compared to two years before, making him much stronger.   As for these two high-quality Artifacts, he could store them in his Elixir Field during his spare time without having to put them in a storage bag.   As such, under the constant nourishment of mana, the two high-quality Artifacts that He Song had refined would naturally become even more handy for him to use.   After comDletelv refining these two high-aualitv Artifacts.   He Song did not immediately leave seclusion.   Instead, he once again immersed himself in the process of cultivating his skills.   Today’s He song, has been back in the Thick Earth Sect for eight years.   In these eight years,   He Song learned the Thick Earth Seal, Earth Dragon Skill, Breath Concealment Skill, and also refined two high-quality Artifacts.   However, even so, He Song still had not stopped his pursuit of becoming stronger.   In these eight years,   Except for daily cultivation, which allowed the mana in his body to continuously increase, He Song spent the rest of his time focusing on improving his own strength.   He even set aside the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array, which he had been studying for several years, and devoted himself solely to learning Foundation Establishment secret techniques every day..

Chapter 196 - 196: 196: Successful Foundation Establishment Translator: 549690339   Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array is a killing array recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction.   Originally, He Song wanted to set it up in the cave mansion outside the Thick Earth Sect.   However, plans cannot keep up with changes.   After returning to the Thick Earth Sect, He Song quickly immersed himself in the cultivation of the Foundation Establishment secret method and had no time to be distracted.   In this situation, he could only temporarily stop studying the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array and focus on cultivating the Foundation Establishment secret method.     As for the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array, he would pick it up again after the ten-year period of rapid strength enhancement had passed.   He Song himself is living in the mountain gate of the Thick Earth Sect, so the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array is not needed for the time being.   And it is precisely because of this.   The Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array has not been successfully studied by He Song.   However, according to He Song’s thoughts,   After spending ten years in the Thick Earth Sect, it would be time to pick up the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array and continue studying it.   Array Tao.   It has always been He Song’s trump card.   As a trump card, He Song would naturally spare no effort to study Array Tao.   It was only because he needed to quickly enhance his combat power this time that he temporarily put it aside for a while.   Now that He Song had returned to the Thick Earth Sect for eight years,   He wasn’t sure whether he would be sent out of the sect by Master Fa Xuan to guard the Immortal Pavilion or Immortal City after his Foundation Establishment.   Thus, during this ten-year period of rapid strength enhancement, He Song constantly strove to increase his strength to avoid being assigned outside and failing to establish a foothold due to insufficient strength.   In the sixth year since He Song returned to the sect,   The war between Thick Earth Sect and Seven Star Sect had already ended.   He Song had personally gone to welcome back his two good friends.   The Foundation Establishment Masters of both Master Fa Xuan and Master Yan Shan’s factions must divide the territories of the Seven Star Sect.   He Song had even heard news that some Foundation Establishment Masters who had just returned to the sect had been sent out to guard Immortal Pavilions, like Master Cheng Shan of the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion in the past.   However, the territories guarded by the Foundation Establishment Masters who had been dispatched this time were no longer within the original scope of the Thick Earth Sect’s power.   They were the territories that the Thick Earth Sect had seized from the Seven Star Sect.   In the original territories of the Seven Star Sect’s influence, there would also need to be Foundation Establishment Masters from the Thick Earth Sect to stabilize the situation.   Otherwise, there might be some instability.   And it is precisely because of this.   He Song dared not stop cultivating the Foundation Establishment method and prioritized everything to increase his strength.   In case he was really sent out to guard an Immortal Pavilion or an Immortal City, he would at least have some confidence to deal with emergencies.   Time.   Slowly passed as He Song closed himself off to cultivate the Foundation Establishment method.   In the blink of an eye,   Two more years had passed in a flash.   Now,   It had been the tenth year since He Song returned to the Thick Earth Sect.   It had been two whole years since He Song refined two high-quality artifacts and significantly increased his strength.   In these two years,   He Song had taken another step forward in the early stage of Foundation Establishment.   Getting closer to the Mid-stage Foundation Establishment.   At the same time, He Song had learned another Foundation Establishment Skill.   Soul Searching Skill.   By using the Soul Searching Skill, one can examine the memories of the person subjected to it.            During the process, the person being searched will suffer intense pain and torment.   After the Soul Searching is over,   The soul-searched person will usually suffer severe damage to their soul, becoming an idiot.   Meanwhile, the person performing the Soul Searching can view all the information they want to know.   With a cultivator’s memory, just watching it once is enough to remember it very clearly.   Therefore, once the Soul Searching skill is used, the cultivator can learn everything they want to know, with no place to hide.   In these two years,   The Thick Earth Sect conducted a series of sweeping operations in the original territories of the Seven Star Sect.   Some forces with loyalty to the Seven Star Sect were uprooted by Foundation Establishment Masters dispatched by the Thick Earth Sect.   There were also some forces unwilling to be under the Thick Earth Sect’s rule that tried to flee but were hunted down and exterminated by Foundation Establishment Masters sent by the Thick Earth Sect.   One after another, Foundation Establishment Masters were sent by the two   Golden Elixir Masters of the Thick Earth Sect to successively occupy various Immortal Pavilions and Immortal Cities in the original territories of the Seven Star Sect.   In the four years since the end of the war,   He Song would occasionally hear who had left the sect to guard the Immortal Pavilion or Immortal City.   Master Qing Yue.   She was assigned to guard an Immortal City that originally belonged to the Seven Star Sect but now belonged to the Thick Earth Sect.   Meng Guan was also sent by Master Fa Xuan to guard an Immortal Pavilion that had just been occupied by the Thick Earth Sect three years after he returned to the sect.   Wei Fan, at the same time as Meng Guan’s departure, was also sent by Master Fa Xuan to an Immortal Pavilion that had just been occupied by the Thick Earth Sect, serving as a Master Guardian.   When Meng Guan and Wei Fan were sent out at the same time, He Song went out of seclusion to see them off.   He also learned that the Immortal Pavilions where the two friends were stationed were not too far away.   He Song memorized the locations of the Immortal Pavilions where his two friends were stationed, and after bidding farewell to them, he received news that Zhao Lin would also be sent elsewhere to guard an Immortal Pavilion.   Zhao Lin.   A good friend who had been in contact with He Song since the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   After breaking through the Foundation Establishment Realm and joining the Thick Earth Sect, he had been in the Foundation Establishment for ten years at the same time as Meng Guan and Wei Fan were sent out to guard the Immortal Pavilions.   Zhao Lin’s Foundation Establishment was a bit later than He Song’s.   However, because He Song successfully built his Foundation Establishment in his own cave mansion and entered the Thick Earth Sect as a recent Foundation Establishment cultivator after four years, the difference in their cultivation time wasn’t large.   Thus.   Even though Zhao Lin’s Foundation Establishment took place later than He Song’s, he completed the ten-year rapid growth period earlier than He Song.   Foundation Establishment cultivators will experience a massive change in strength within ten years after their Foundation Establishment.   After ten years, they can possess the combat power of an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator.   As such, Zhao Lin has also spent a full ten years in the Thick Earth Sect.   He Song once visited him after returning to the sect.   The two of them had a great time talking.   Moreover, they are now fellow disciples, and were even close friends before.   Their relationship, after their long-awaited reunion, did not change much and they still called each other good friends.   Zhao Lin was soon to be dispatched to guard an Immortal Pavilion elsewhere.   He Song naturally went to see him off.   After also noting down the specific location of the Immortal Pavilion guarded by Zhao Lin, He Song sent him away from the mountain gate.   From now on.   All three of He Song’s good friends within the Thick Earth Sect had been sent to other places to guard them.   He also knew in his heart.   After he had spent ten years in the sect, he would undoubtedly be dispatched elsewhere as a Master Guardian of an Immortal Pavilion or Immortal City-   By then.   It might not be as simple to return to the sect to learn Foundation Establishment techniques as it was before.   Thus.   While He Song continued to practice the Soul Searching Skill in these two years, he also frequently went to the Thick Earth Sect’s Book Collection Pavilion, imprinting one Foundation Establishment secret technique after another into his memory.            In that case.   In case he had to leave the Thick Earth Sect in the future.   His cultivation in the Foundation Establishment Realm and various techniques would not fall too far behind.   However.   Although he had already made preparations for future difficulties, He Song couldn’t help but covet the Golden Elixir techniques beyond Foundation Establishment.   He had already suffered from the lack of Foundation Establishment techniques when he broke through to Foundation Establishment.   If he were to break through to Golden Elixir without acquiring Golden Elixir Realm techniques like back then, he would probably not be able to compare his combat power to other sects’ Golden Elixir Masters even if his cultivation reached the Golden Elixir Realm.   By then…   He Song felt a sense of urgency in his heart.   He might need to make good plans for obtaining the Golden Elixir techniques of the Thick Earth Sect.   After bidding farewell to his three friends, He Song spent the following time continuously studying Soul Searching Skill.   Until one day.   He Song had completely cultivated the Soul Searching Skill to the point where he could use it freely without sacrificing its power.   Today.   It happened to be ten years since He Song returned to the Thick Earth Sect.   It also meant that, in the eyes of others, He Song had been in the Foundation Establishment stage for ten years.   However, those people did not know that He Song had already been at Foundation Establishment stage for fourteen years, only spending four of those years in the cave mansion he had opened outside, which they were unaware of.   Even so.   In the eyes of others, after ten years of Foundation Establishment.   He Song should have also owned the combat power of the Foundation Establishment Realm.   It was time for him to be assigned to important tasks and be dispatched to guard Immortal Pavilions or Immortal Cities.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m   As a Thick Earth Sect elder.   Receiving an annual salary of three thousand spirit stones.   Naturally, he had to work for it.   Now that He Song had come out of seclusion, he feared that orders about him would arrive soon.   By that time.   He Song would have no choice but to go to the place specified in the order, guarding an Immortal Pavilion or an Immortal City for the Thick Earth Sect.   However.   Just as He Song had just come out of seclusion and was preparing to make another trip to the Book Collection Pavilion to see if there were any other Foundation Establishment techniaues he still needed to oreoare.   The Sound Transmission Amulet hung on his body suddenly lit up.   Seeing this scene.   He Song’s face changed slightly.   Could it be… his orders had arrived?   It had only been ten years, and Master Fa Xuan couldn’t even wait for a day, so eager to send him out of the sect?   With this thought flashing through his mind, He Song soon let it go.   That’s true.   Now that the Thick Earth Sect occupied a large area of the Seven Star Sect’s territory, it was in dire need of manpower.   Foundation Establishment Masters like him, who possess Foundation Establishment combat power, were naturally scarce.   Whether they were used to guard Immortal Pavilions or Immortal Cities, they were useful.   He Song just felt that it was a bit too hasty.   Opening the Sound Transmission Amulet.   He Song took a thin piece of paper from the Sound Transmission Amulet.   “Brother He, Ping’er successfully reached Foundation Establishment nine years ago, but has been in seclusion since then. Knowing that Brother He has also been in seclusion, I have not purposely disturbed you. I hope Brother He will not mind.”   “With the help of Master, Ping’er now has the combat power of the Foundation Establishment stage.”   “However, recently Pinger has heard that Brother He seems to be about to leave seclusion soon and be transferred elsewhere. I wonder if it is possible to visit you before leaving.”   “Ping’er. ”   Looking at the graceful writing on the paper, He Song’s expression slightly fluctuated.   Ping’er.   She has reached Foundation Establishment?   And as early as nine years ago?        

Chapter 197 - 197 197: No Time to Waste The reason Master Qingyue sent He Song back to the sect.   One of the reasons was also to provide Ping’er with resources for Foundation Establishment.   However, in the ten years since returning to the Thick Earth Sect, He Song completely forgot about Ping’er’s upcoming Foundation Establishment, only focusing on increasing his own strength.   Unexpectedly, when his ten-year term at the sect was coming to an end and he was about to be reassigned elsewhere, Ping’er learned the news and wanted to see him before leaving.   Looking at the beautiful handwriting on the paper, He Song hesitated for a moment and soon decided to accept the invitation.   Now.     After the Foundation Establishment, the ten-year period for quickly increasing combat power has expired.   The order for his reassignment could arrive any day.   It would not hurt to meet with Ping’er before leaving the sect.   After all, if the reassignment order really comes, the chances of He Song and Ping’er seeing each other would be greatly reduced.   After all, Ping’er could be considered a friend He Song met a long time ago.   Now that she had invited him, it would be difficult for He Song to refuse.   With a casual gesture, He Song took out a piece of thin paper and mana surged from the tips of his fingers, instantly carving out lines of text on the paper.   “Congratulations to Junior Sister Ping’er on successfully reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, and may your Immortal Path be unhindered from now on.”   “I have now left seclusion, and Ping’er dao friend is welcome to come to my cave mansion for a chat.”   “He Song.”   He put the paper into the Sound Transmission Amulet, and with a surge of mana, the paper inside the amulet disappeared immediately.   Seeing this,   He Song casually hung the Sound Transmission Amulet around his waist.   But soon after, He Song’s figure appeared in the tea room of his cave mansion.   As He Song continued his actions,    Wisps of tea fragrance soon filled the cave mansion.   Under swirls of tea aroma, He Song’s entire cave mansion was enveloped in a refreshing tea scent.   Since Ping’er was already in the Thick Earth Sect,   He Song informed her of the location of his cave mansion when he sent the message.   As a result, He Song didn’t have to wait long.   Only a moment later,   He Song saw tunneling light descending from the sky and landing outside his cave mansion.   He casually opened a passage in the Purple Cloud Heavenly Array and welcomed Ping’er into his cave mansion.   The two sat down in the tea room, one as host and the other as guest.   “Congratulations to Junior Sister for successfully reaching Foundation Establishment, may your Immortal Path be unhindered from now on.”   Upon meeting, He Song’s first words to Ping’er were still words of congratulations.   Although he had already congratulated her in the previous message, when he saw her face to face, He Song added another line of congratulations.   After all, more than nine years ago, He Song had already known that Ping’er was about to establish her foundation.   But after nine years, He Song had been immersed in his seclusive cultivation and had completely forgotten about Ping’er’s Foundation Establishment.   It was only when Ping’er informed him that she was approaching the ten-year mark that he learned of the matter.   Otherwise,   It might take He Song even longer to remember Ping’er’s Foundation Establishment.   In order to cover up the slight embarrassment in his heart, He Song didn’t use his usual greetings when he spoke.   “Thank you, Senior Brother, but this time, besides seeing Senior Brother, Ping’er also has a troubling matter.”   With her eyes shifting, Ping’er looked at He Song, taking a sip of tea.   Her vision brightened immediately, and she took another sip of tea.   But then, her face showed a trace of worry.   Seeing this,    He Song’s mind suddenly flashed with a hint of caution.   What troubles are bothering her?   Ping’er has already reached Foundation Establishment now.   He himself was just establishing Foundation as well.   Both at Foundation Establishment stage,   If it’s something Ping’er cannot handle,   Could he handle it?   With a bad feeling in his heart, He Song intended to directly refuse after thinking it over.   Otherwise, when Ping’er asked him later, and he refused, it would make him appear too reluctant to help.   However,   Before he could even speak,DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com   Ping’er, with a worried expression on her face, spoke in a low voice,   “Ah, more than a decade ago, Shuangshuang Senior Sister failed to establish her foundation, and after recovering from her injuries, she went to the Mountain Immortal City.”   “Master has been worried about her over the years, but he knows Shuangshuang Senior Sister’s character. If he takes her back forcibly, she may leave again.”   “Master is well aware that this matter can’t be forced, so he entrusted it to me.”   As her gaze met He Song’s, Ping’er’s eyes flashed with an indescribable expression.   “Before Senior Sister Shuangshuang left, she wanted to see you, but you failed to establish your foundation and were in the process of healing, so she never saw you.”   “I wonder if Ping’er can ask Senior Brother for help to meet Shuangshuang Senior Sister together. If we can persuade her to return…”   “Ping’er will never forget Senior Brother’s great kindness.”   As Ping’er’s words continued, He Song’s plan to interrupt and directly refuse also quickly dissipated.   This matter.   There was no danger involved.   He didn’t need to refuse outright.   After all, he had once promised Chu Shuangshuang that once he left seclusion, whether or not he had established his foundation, he would visit her personally.   Now that he had successfully achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm and had the strength to do so, it was time to fulfill that promise.   Besides, apart from promising Chu Shuangshuang,   He Song had also promised Master Qingyue while returning to the Thick Earth Sect that if he saw Chu Shuangshuang, he would definitely help to persuade her.

Chapter 198 - 198: 198: What is Caution Translator: 549690339   “Thank you, Senior Brother He Song, for clearing up my confusion. I hadn’t expected the color of the tunneling light to have such profound implications.   I’ve learned a lot today.”   Bowing to He Song, Ping’er looked at him with a hint of admiration in her eyes, feeling that inviting him to leave the sect to visit Chu Shuangshuang had been the right choice.   Otherwise, with her original golden tunneling light, if someone took a disliking to her while she was outside, they could directly attack her with a sword, and she would be killed.   As He Song had said, changing the tunneling light to a water-blue color made it much safer for her to venture outside.     With this thought in mind,   Ping’er looked down below.   She suddenly found that the mortal and cultivator people on the ground below didn’t seem to notice her and He Song’s tunneling light at all, and no one was looking up at the sky anymore.   Seeing this, Ping’er’s eyes instantly filled with even more admiration for He Song.   As expected, everything Senior Brother had said was true.   As long as she changed the color of her tunneling light to water-blue, people below wouldn’t notice her while she was flying through the sky, unless they deliberately looked for her.   “It’s no big deal. I’m just being a little cautious. Such trivial matters aren’t worth mentioning.”   He Song waved his hand, not caring much about Pinger’s gratitude.   Although he was somewhat surprised that Ping’er had immediately changed the color of her tunneling light to water-blue after hearing his advice, he didn’t think he was doing her a great favor by mentioning it casually.   In the sky,   the two water-blue tunneling lights flew by almost unnoticed, quickly crossing the horizon and heading towards the distant Mountain Immortal City.   Both of them were Foundation Establishment Masters. As they used their tunneling skills to move forward, their speed was naturally extremely fast.   However, because the speed of the Blood Escape Skill was obviously faster than other tunneling skills, He Song had no choice but to slow down and fly side by side with Ping’er.   The speed of the Blood Escape Skill, even when used only with mana, was much faster than other tunneling skills.   It was a life-saving ace skill.   Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate, was not far from Mountain Immortal City.   In just three days, the two had traveled from Thick Earth Sect to Mountain Immortal City.   About ten miles outside of Mountain Immortal City,   He Song and Ping’er’s figures landed in a forest.   It’s not that flying was forbidden within the Mountain Immortal City, but that restriction only applied to Qi Refining cultivators. For Foundation Establishment Masters, this rule did not apply.   Generally speaking, visiting Foundation Establishment Masters would transform themselves into tunneling light and come directly from afar, landing straight in Mountain Immortal City.   However, He Song and Ping’er had not done so this time.   “Senior Brother, why did we land dozens of miles outside the Immortal City?   We could have tunneled directly into the city.”   Next to him, Ping’er, who had been stopped by He Song, was puzzled and immediately asked.   But out of trust for He Song, she only asked the question instead of continuing forward.   Seeing this,   He Song shook his head, gazing in the direction of Mountain Immortal City with a flash of insight in his eyes.   “Junior Sister has spent most of her time cultivatinz under Master Qinzvue and knows little about the outside world.”   “What Junior Sister doesn’t know is that whether entering the Immortal City or Immortal Pavilion, one has to observe from a distance for a moment to ensure there are no abnormalities before entering.”   “Otherwise, if we fall into a trap, we may not have the chance to escape.”   After the insight had flashed, He Song saw that there were no abnormalities in Mountain Immortal City, and proceeded forward towards it.   But this time, He Song used the Qi Refining Early Stage Mountain Wind Riding Skill instead of his tunneling skill.   Simultaneously, his cultivation level also changed from Foundation Establishment Early Stage to Qi Refining Late Stage.   On the side,   Ping’er, who had heard He Song’s words and noticed his actions and the change in his cultivation level, was suddenly filled with astonishment.   What…   Were there so many intricacies to a cultivator’s journey in the outside world?    When trying to enter an Immortal City,   you would land from mid-air dozens of miles away and observe the city to see if there were any abnormalities.   And when entering the city, you would hide your cultivation level and only use your Qi Refining stage Wind Riding Skill to travel.   In this way, even if there were any ambushes within the city, He Song, as a Foundation Establishment Early Stage cultivator, could immediately retreat.   This cautiousness was utterly contrary to the righteous and straightforward teachings Master Qingyue had given her.   However, when they had first met at Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, He Song had already shown his exceptional caution, which set him apart from other cultivators.   It was precisely because of He Song’s uniqueness at that time that Ping’er had wanted to actively form a connection with him.   Now, as Ping’er took in everything 1–1e Song said and did, it only reinforced her strong sense of agreement with his approach. Caution was key to surviving for a long time!   If He Song wasn’t cautious enough, then forget about reaching the Foundation Establishment stage,   whether he could even cultivate to the Qi Refining Mid -Stage would be in doubt.   With the scene of their first meeting flashing through her mind, Ping’er steadied her nerves and quickly followed in He Song’s footsteps.   At the same time, Ping’er’s aura became faint, and the tunneling skill she used also changed to the Qi Refining Wind Riding Skill.   Catching up to He Song,   Pinger saw the surprise in He Song’s eyes as he looked at her and quickly blushed, explaining:   “Senior Brother, please don’t blame me. In the past nine years, I haven’t practiced the Breath Concealment Skill but only relied on the Breath Concealment Formulas to manage.”   “But don’t worry, Senior Brother. After I persuade my Senior Sister, I will definitely learn the Breath Concealment Skill first.”   Using the Breath Concealment Formulas to completely conceal her presence,   Ping’er naturally knew that they were nothing more than a Qi Refining skill and were not as exquisite as the Breath Concealment Skill.   However, things had already come to this point, and since she hadn’t learned the Breath Concealment Skill, she could only do this.   Although the Breath Concealment Formulas were not as effective in hiding   one’s own cultivation as Breath Concealment Skill, it should be enough for the time being.   Their purpose here.   Was merely to persuade Chu Shuangshuang.   As for meeting with other Foundation Establishment Masters, neither of them had thought about it.   As long as they didn’t encounter any other Foundation Establishment Masters, there was not much difference between the Breath Concealment Skill and the Breath Concealment Formulas.   On the side.   Hearing Ping’er’s explanation, He Song had a strange look on his face.   Everything he did was simply because of his cautious nature and habits he had formed over a long time.   Unexpectedly.   Pinger had copied his cautious behavior.   However, because Ping’er hadn’t practiced the same skill as him, she was slightly different.   If Ping’er had practiced the Breath Concealment Skill.   He Song was sure that Ping’er would also hide her own cultivation like him and only reveal her Qi-refining late stage cultivation to the outside world.   Maybe if he teaches her.   She would become extremely cautious.   At that time, perhaps Ping’er would also become an extremely cautious person in the path of cultivation.   Thinking about that scenario.   He Song immediately looked at Ping’er.   Then he looked at himself.   A thought flashed through his mind.   Maybe… it’s worth a try?   He had known Ping’er for many, many years.   From the time when both of them were at the Qi Refining Early Stage, to now, when they both became Foundation Establishment Masters.   The time in between was not short.   There must have been decades.   Having known each other for so long, Ping’er and he could be considered fated.    Although they were not close friends, they had a relatively good friendship.   Moreover.   Even if he didn’t teach her.   Ping’er might not be familiar with the outside world due to never having ventured alone, so her understanding of the outside world is very limited.   Now she seems to be subconsciously imitating his actions.   From the tunneling light to the Breath Concealment Skill and Wind Riding Skill, it could be seen that Ping’er was imitating very seriously.   Perhaps even if he didn’t teach her, she would also gradually become as cautious as He Song in their interactions.   However, this would result in many detours being taken.   Instead of that.   He might as well give some guidance, which could also be considered as fulfilling his duty toward Ping’er.   After all, Foundation Establishment Masters like Ping’er, who have little contact with the outside world, would always have an adaptation period after being sent out.   But since they became Foundation Establishment Masters as soon as they left the sect, the adaptation should be relatively quick.   After the adaptation period and having an understanding of the outside environment, their mentality would gradually mature.   If he were to guide her at this time.   It might help Ping’er avoid many detours.   With these thoughts in mind, He Song immediately spoke up.   “No need to worry, this matter is not urgent, our priority now is to find Junior   Sister Shuangshuang, do you know where she is now?”   He Song casually asked as he and Ping’er entered the Mountain Immortal City one after the other.   The matter of making Ping’er more cautious.   Could be considered later.   He Song naturally wouldn’t rush it.   Therefore, he turned his attention back to Chu Shuangshuang.   As Chu Shuangshuang’s junior sister, Ping’er should know her whereabouts.   “Follow me. I know where my senior sister is. Over the years, we have always maintained contact.”   “It’s a pity that Senior Sister failed in her Foundation Establishment, sigh.”   As Ping’er sighed.   He Song did not say anything further.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience   Foundation Establishment.   Has always been like a thousand troops crossing a single-log bridge.   Starting from the Qi-refining mid stage, many cultivators are stopped and trapped in that realm for life.   Chu Shuangshuang being able to reach Qi Refining great perfection was already quite good.   Ordinary cultivators, with bad luck, could only yearn to reach the Qi-refining mid stage.   Not to mention Qi Refining great perfection.   Achieving Foundation Establishment was like a step into the heavens, a realm that could bring blessings to future generations.   Falling in the bottleneck of the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Although cruel, it was actually already better than countless others.   With no more words, He Song and Ping’er swiftly passed through streets and alleys.   Eventually, the two stopped in front of a small courtyard.   “Senior Sister, Senior Sister, it’s me, Ping’er. I’m here to see you.”   Upon arriving here, He Song saw Ping’er step forward and call for her senior sister.   Soon.   With a creak.   The gate of the small courtyard opened.   A petite figure walked out from behind the gate.   The moment Chu Shuangshuang saw Ping’er, she threw herself towards her.   “Good junior sister, you finally came to see me.”   However, before the two could touch each other, Chu Shuangshuang, who had lunged toward Ping’er, suddenly stopped in her tracks.   She saw He Song standing behind Ping’er..

Chapter 199 - 199: 199: A Paper Transfer Order Translator: 549690339   He Song reacted quickly, turning his head to the side in an instant as if attracted by a distant scenery.   For a moment, a surprised look flashed across Chu Shuangshuang’s face.   Then, as if nothing had happened,   after clearing her throat, her entire demeanor suddenly became more dignified.   “Ahem, so Ping’er and Mr. He have arrived. Please come in and have a seat.”     With Chu Shuangshuang’s repeated invitations, the three people entered the small courtyard.   With a creak, the courtyard door closed behind them.   In the courtyard,   Chu Shuangshuang and He Song sat across from each other at a stone table.   In front of the three of them,   a teapot hovered in mid-air, as if held by an invisible hand, pouring tea into each of their cups.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com   As the teapot landed, a faint tea fragrance permeated the small courtyard.   Pinger picked up her tea cup and took a sip.   She instantly tasted the difference.   This tea…   It was much inferior to the one she had tasted from He Song before.   The spirit tea she had previously tasted at He Song’s cave mansion was the Foundation Establishment Spirit Tea he had specially bought from the sect.   Although not particularly precious, it had some benefits for Foundation Establishment cultivators, even if only a slight increase in mana.   Now, this tea tasted weaker, and the increased mana could be neglected.   However, even so, Pinger didn’t show any disappointment, even deliberately drinking another sip before putting down her tea cup. One was a Foundation Establishment Master, and the other a Qi-refining cultivator.   It was only natural that their belongings would differ somewhat.   Chu Shuangshuang was the senior sister who had led her own introduction to Master Qing Yue’s tutelage, so Ping’er naturally wouldn’t show any dissatisfaction.   Next to her,   He Song’s expression was unchanged, picking up the teacup in front of him and taking a small sip.   He didn’t show any difference either.   After nodding slightly, he took another sip.   Only then did he put down his tea cup and look at Chu Shuangshuang in front of him.   Chu Shuangshuang was still the same Chu Shuangshuang.   With a petite figure and beautiful face, she looked very well-behaved, but in reality, her character was quite bold.   It was a pity that she had failed to establish her foundation.   Her lifespan was now reduced to just a few decades.   A look of regret flashed in He Song’s eyes.   “Shuangshuang’s hospitality may be lacking, so do not take offense.”   With a flick of her fingers, Chu Shuangshuang used her spirit power to refill their tea and then said,   Hearing her words,   He Song and the others shook their heads, indicating that it was sufficient. Seeing this, Chu Shuangshuang knew that He Song and the others were only trying to be polite.   Nine years ago, when Ping’er succeeded in establishing her foundation, she had heard news of their success with Foundation Establishment as well.   At that time, she had felt the unpredictability of life, but was powerless to change it.   Fortunately, after nine years, her unwillingness had dissipated over time, otherwise, upon seeing the two of them, her emotions would not be so peaceful.   She, a disciple who had grown up by the side of a master since childhood, had failed to establish her foundation.   He Song and Ping’er, who used to be mere loose cultivators, had both succeeded in establishing their foundations.   With such a gap, it was fortunate that Chu Shuangshuang had known them for a long time and that their relationships were harmonious, otherwise, it was likely that her dao heart would be broken.   But now, seeing He Song and Ping’er treating her like nothing had changed, Chu Shuangshuang felt better, her smile becoming more sincere.   “Mr. He, I trust you’ve been well since we last met.”   “Before I was sent out of the sect, I always wanted to see Mr. He. Unfortunately, Mr. He was recuperating from injuries at that time, so I missed the opportunity to meet him.”    “I didn’t expect Mr. He to still remember what was said that day. Now that Mr.   He visits me personally, I feel quite flattered.”   With her gaze on He Song, Chu Shuangshuang said. He Song and Ping’er had a close relationship, and they had been acquainted with her for over 20 years.   Therefore, with He Song paying her a visit, she naturally wouldn’t neglect him.   Moreover, she was the one who originally asked to meet He Song. Now that He Song had come to fulfill his promise, she was naturally happy.   “I do not wish to hide the matter from you, junior sister. In addition to keeping my promise, I am also committed to fulfilling Master Qing Yue’s request to persuade you to return.”   “Ten years ago, Master Qing Yue had men tioned to me her longing for you.”   “Now, another ten years have passed, and I fear that Master Qing Yue’s yearning for you…”   As he spoke, He Song paused, hesitating to continue.   But in the end, he did not say anything more, only shaking his head and sighing.   When Master Qing Yue spoke to him about this matter back then, He Song still vividly remembered the look in her eyes.   Chu Shuangshuang had been here for over a decade.   In these years, although Master Qing Yue had not come looking for her, it was only because she knew Chu Shuangshuang’s personality, and did not want to force her to return.   To say that she didn’t miss her was impossible.   The fact that she was yearning to see her but had to entrust the matter of persuasion to someone else, as well as Ping’er’s invitation, was the reason He Song was here now.   “Yes, Master has been saying your name all these years, and from time to time, she would gaze at the direction of the Mountain Immortal City, lost in thought for a long time.”   “Master even told me that if I were to fail in establishing my foundation, she would still keep me by her side.”   “Senior sister, Master never blamed you. Let’s go back together, okay?”   At the side, seeing He Song suddenly bringing up the matter, Ping’er took advantage of the momentum to start persuading her as well.   The two of them came this time,   Not only to catch up with Chu Shuangshuang, but also to persuade her to return.   Now that He Song had started, Ping’er naturally wouldn’t lag behind.   After hearing He Song and Ping’er’s persuasion, Chu Shuangshuang’s face gradually became blank.   She had only run away to mountain Immortal City because she had failed in her Foundation Establishment and didn’t know how to face Master Qingy Yue.   But now, more than ten years had passed in the blink of an eye.   The sense of helplessness in her heart had long since dissipated.   The reason why she had not returned yet.   Was merely because she could not find a way to approach the subject with Master Qingy Yue.   She also missed Master Qingy Yue in her heart.   Therefore.   When He Song and Ping’er arrived.   And provided her with a way out.   Chu Shuangshuang naturally wouldn’t resist too much.   With the flow.   After much hesitation and Ping’er’s continuous persuasion, Chu Shuangshuang finally nodded and agreed to the matter.   In persuading her.   He Song did not make much effort.   Beyond being the first to initiate the conversation, the rest of the persuasion was done by Ping’er.   During this process, He Song did nothing but drink tea.   Only occasionally nodding in agreement with Ping’er’s words.   Apart from that.   He did nothing more.   However, even so, He Song had already fulfilled what he had promised to Master Qingy Yue, as well as Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang.   He had met Chu Shuangshuang.   And had also tried to persuade her.   Although his efforts were not great.   But the result was good.   With Ping’er’s efforts, Chu Shuangshuang opened her heart quickly, and now was even discussing with Ping’er what gifts to bring back for Master Qingy Yue.    Seeing this, He Song naturally understood that their mission in coming here had been accomplished.   However.   Before He Song could relax.   The Sound Transmission Amulet hanging on his body was lighting up at this moment.   Seeing this, He Song knew in his heart.   Perhaps this time.   Master Fa Xuan’s order had really arrived.   At the side, Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang were also attracted by the light.   For a moment, the small courtyard became quiet.   Ignoring the gaze of the two women beside him, He Song opened the Sound Transmission Amulet and casually took out a thin piece of paper from it.   “Elder He Song, has been in the Foundation Establishment for ten years, is now transferred to Jade Immortal City’s Herbs Immortal Workshop as a guardian.”   “In charge of all affairs of the Herbs Immortal Workshop.”   “Master Fa Xuan. ”   He Song raised an eyebrow slightly.   And sighed in his heart.   Sure enough.   Sure enough.   Given the Thick Earth Sect’s shortage of personnel, it was impossible for someone like He Song, who had just achieved Foundation Establishment Master-level fighting power, to be left idle.   But.   No sooner had He Song left the Thick Earth Sect than he received Master Fa Xuan’s order.   However, looking at the description on the paper, He Song couldn’t help but feel a sigh of relief in his heart.   Luckily, in the past ten years, he had been constantly improving his strength. Now, He Song’s power should be considered quite good among the Early Foundation Establishment Masters.   With enough strength, the position of Immortal Workshop guardian was quite suitable for He Song.   As a guardian of the Immortal Workshop.   One usually only needed to stay in the Immortal Workshop to protect it.   Of course, if you wanted to, you could also get involved in the affairs within the Immortal Workshop to earn more spirit stones.   However, these matters were usually not personally handled by the Workshop Guardians.   Beyond that, the Workshop guardian had no other responsibilities.   During the guarding process of the Immortal Workshop.   Whether it was seclusive cultivation.   Or studying skills.   Or experiencing all aspects of life within the Immortal Workshop.   All were acceptable.   However, if one were like Master Cheng Shan of Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, who suffered a great loss after going out for a trip, the annual salary of the Immortal Workshop Guardian would be reduced according to the extent of damage suffered by the workshop.   That was also the reason why Master Cheng Shan had mercilessly killed those evil cultivators at that time.   But for He Song.   He never minded the annual salary of the Thick Earth Sect.   That little bit of annual salary held no great temptation for He Song.   If he hadn’t been still thinking about the Golden Elixir Skill Means in the Thick Earth Sect’s Book Collection Pavilion, He Song might have returned to his cave mansion after learning the Foundation Establishment Skill of the Thick Earth Sect and embarked on seclusive cultivation.   Therefore.   When faced with a real crisis, He Song would naturally choose to flee for his life.   As for the Immortal Workshop?   What Immortal Workshop?   Was the Immortal Workshop more important than his own life?   Putting away the paper in his hand, He Song wanted to say something and then take his leave.   But he didn’t expect.   Just as he was about to speak.   Another light flared up from Ping’er’s body at this moment.   He Song saw it clearly.   It was the unique light of a Sound Transmission Amulet.   Pinger’s Sound Transmission Amulet also lit up at this moment.   Seeing this, He Song chose not to speak, and waited for Ping’er to finish reading the message from her Sound Transmission Amulet before saying his goodbyes..

Chapter 200 - 200: 200: Herbs Immortal Workshop Translator: 549690339   Just then, the Sound Transmission Amulet on Ping’er’s body lit up as well.   Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang’s gaze both immediately fell on Ping’er.   Seeing that everyone’s attention was on her, Ping’er quickly took out her Sound Transmission Amulet.   Opened it.   Immediately.     Her expression changed.   He Song didn’t try to peek at who had sent the message to Ping’er, nor did he know what exactly was said in the message.   But judging from the change in Pinger’s expression.   The message she received should be similar to the one he had received. Although Pinger was only nine years into Foundation Establishment,   with the help of Master Qingyue, she had gained the strength of Foundation Establishment in just nine years.   Since she had the strength of Foundation Establishment, Ping’er was naturally considered a Foundation Establishment Master.   Under the premise that the Thick Earth Sect did not have enough hands,   Ping’er, who already had Foundation Establishment strength, would naturally receive the orders for deployment as well.   He just didn’t know.   Whether Ping’er and his positions as guardians would be close to each other since they received the deployment orders one after another.   If they were not far apart, the two could still have some cooperation.   At least in crisis situations, it would not be a case of no one to support them.   With various thoughts flashing through his mind, He Song’s eyes turned to   Ping’er.   He saw that Ping’er was also looking at him at the moment.   “Senior Brother, the Sect Leader has sent an adjustment order for me to go to the Wolf Immortal Pavilion of the Jade Immortal City to be the Master Guardian…” Ping’er said as she flipped the paper in her hand to show the side with the words on it, a trace of helplessness in her voice.   Originally, she was just a minor immortal cultivator.   Later, by chance, she met Chu Shuangshuang, a disciple of a true master, which allowed her to survive the big disaster at the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Afterwards, she progressed rapidly, joining the ranks of Master Qingyue’s disciples and becoming a disciple of a true master.   Now, she had reached the Foundation Establishment stage.   But because she had always lived within the Immortal Pavilion, under Master Qingyue’s protection, and in the small courtyard of the Thick Earth Sect’s gate, she was quite unfamiliar with various affairs outside.   However, what opinion could He Song have?   He looked at the paper in Ping’er’s hand, apart from the name of the Immortal Pavilion being different, it seemed to be identical to the one he received.   Seeing this, He Song could only shake his head.   “As a Foundation Establishment Master, as long as you go to this Wolf Immortal Pavilion, you won’t have any difficulties.”   “Even if there are difficulties, killing a few people would be no problem at all.”   “Junior Sister, just be at ease.”   Indeed, as He Song said,   if the Master Guardian appointed by the Thick Earth Sect encountered difficulties in the Immortal Pavilion under their watch, there must be someone sabotaging things.   In that case, killing that person or those people who were getting in the way would naturally stabilize the Immortal Pavilion.   Foundation Establishment Masters have mastery over life and death.   It’s not that without their own helpers, they can only let those below deceive and suppress others. In the Cultivation World, might makes right.   If a Qi Refining cultivator dared to jump in front of a Foundation   Establishment Master, they must be prepared to be crushed at any time.   “By the way, I too have received the order for deployment from the Sect Leader, so I need to leave first.”   “I cannot defy the Sect Leader’s orders, and I need to hurry to the Herbs Immortal Workshop.”    After informing Pinger of his thoughts, He Song quickly chose to say his goodbyes and leave.   He recalled the location of the Herbs Immortal Workshop he was ordered to guard.   Even the Wolf Immortal Pavilion where Ping’er was stationed, He Song already knew its location.   Wolf Immortal Pavilion.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   Herbs Immortal Workshop.   These two Immortal Pavilions were not far apart and even could be considered adjacenty_from each other.   Starting from the Herbs Immortal Workshop, one only needed to travel a few hundred miles to reach the Wolf Immortal Pavilion.   At this distance, even if one person encountered trouble, the other could quickly arrive to resolve the crisis.   At the same time,   knowing that his guarded Herbs Immortal Pavilion was so close to Ping’er’s guarded Wolf Immortal Pavilion, He Song felt a desire to become good friends with Ping’er.   Having more friends meant having more help.   In case something unexpected happened in the future, with Ping’er’s support, he might be able to feel more at ease.   In this case, when saying goodbye, He Song looked at Ping’er, wondering whether he should go together with Ping’er to the locations of their guarded Immortal Pavilions.   What He Song was thinking,   But when He Song spoke to say his goodbyes, hearing his words, Chu   Shuangshuang understood his intentions and said,   “In that case, you two should set off quickly. You two received the Sect Leader’s orders almost at the same time, so you must be close to each other.” “I will also set off immediately to return to my Master’s side.”   “I just don’t know where my Master is right now.”   However, as she spoke, Chu Shuangshuang turned her pleading gaze to Ping’er.   Due to the shame of meeting Master Qingyue again, Chu Shuangshuang had little contact with Qingyue.   Under these circumstances, it was normal for her not to know where Master Qingyue was at the moment.   On the side, hearing Chu Shuangshuang’s words, Ping’er’s eyes lit up.   She Imew where Master Qingyue was now.   At the same time, she suddenly remembered that the place she was about to go to seemed to be on the way.   “Master is currently guarding the Jade Immortal City, and the place I’m heading to is also within the jurisdiction of the Jade Immortal City, the Wolf Immortal Pavilion. We can go together.”   “I don’t know where Senior Brother is guarding, would you be able to travel with us?”   As they spoke, Ping’er looked towards He Song.   Seeing that He Song had already nodded slightly, he then replied.   “What a coincidence, the place I am going is also under the jurisdiction of Jade Immortal City, called the Herbs Immortal Workshop.”   Herbs Immortal Workshop and Wolf Immortal Pavilion are both under the jurisdiction of the Jade Immortal City.   Master Qingyue happens to be in the Jade Immortal City.   Chu Shuangshuang’s destination is also the Jade Immortal City.   It happens to be on the way for both of them.   As a result,   Chu Shuangshuang started packing her things once she knew this.   A moment later, when Chu Shuangshuang had finished packing, He Song waved his hand and released the White Jade Boat he had already refined for himself.   The White Jade Boat slowly grew bigger, and under He Song’s control, it soon accommodated the three of them.   Upon seeing this, the three of them stepped onto the White Jade Boat one after another.   Meanwhile, the White Jade Boat, under He Song’s control, quickly soared into the sky and sped towards the direction of Jade Immortal City.   Only envious gazes were left behind in the Mountain Immortal City.   A spirit boat, the standard equipment of a Foundation Establishment Master.   Seeing a spirit boat soaring into the sky, the Qi Refining cultivators knew that a Foundation Establishment Master was leaving.   What they did not know was,   on He Song’s spirit boat, there were not just one Foundation Establishment Master, but two.    Apart from He Song, Ping’er was also a Foundation Establishment Master.   Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang, at this moment, stood behind He Song, letting him control the White Jade Boat, taking them forward continuously.   “Senior Brother, are there any precautions we should be aware of while traveling on a spirit boat? Will the spirit boat attract too much attention?”   After getting away from the Mountain Immortal City.   Ping’er, who had been quietly waiting on the spirit boat for a while, suddenly asked He Song.   Since there are precautions to be taken when using tunneling light to travel and when entering the Immortal City.   There should be precautions to take when traveling on a spirit boat, right?   After all, the spirit boat is conspicuous.   One might risk their own safety should they be targeted.   Unknowingly, Ping’er began to have a cautious heart, even asking about it at this moment.   Seing this, He Song turned his head and looked at her.   He was surprised but also appreciated Ping’er’s cautious attitude.   She is really taking her emulation of his cautiousness seriously.   However ,   He Song usually does not use the spirit boat when traveling.   If it weren’t for the presence of Chu Shuangshuang, a Qi Refining great perfection cultivator, He Song would not use the spirit boat.   When he needs to travel, he usually employs Earth Tunneling Skill.   Or Blood Escape Skill.   The spirit boat seems a bit too ostentatious.   “There isn’t much to be cautious about; just stay alert at all times. In case someone tries to ambush you, you’ll be able to react quickly.”   “For general travel, you can use tunneling skill, or if you don’t want to be discovered, you can learn an Earth Tunneling Skill and travel underground.” Shaking his head, He Song casually mentioned a few things.   Since Ping’er is already emulating his cautious attitude, he might as well teach her a bit more.   Whether Ping’er can learn or understand, it’s all up to fate.   He Song can’t predict how much she can learn.   On the side,   After hearing He Song’s response, Ping’er thoughtfully nodded.   “Earth Tunneling Skill? Can it also be used for travel?”   In her heart, Ping’er was puzzled.   To her knowledge, Earth Tunneling Skill was mainly used for sneak attacks or avoiding pursuits.   Travel?   Aside from people like He Song who were inherently cautious and liked to explore survival methods, there were not many people who used Earth Tunneling Skill for travel.   Cultivators are supposed to be refined and dignified.   The reason cultivators prefer tea over wine is precisely because of this.   The love for flying among cultivators, who even spend large sums of money to buy Light Body Skill, is also because of this. The beauty of cultivators is likewise because of this.   Cultivators…   They are always different from ordinary people.   Traveling underground, walking beneath the feet of countless people, does not align with the temperament of a cultivator, and thus not many people use Earth Tunneling Skill for travel.   Only He Song, who had crossed over from another world, and not deeply bound by the conventional etiquette of cultivators, could do this without any psychological burden.   Other cultivators in this world would generally not do this.   Of course, some oddballs are exceptions.   Therefore, after hearing He Song’s words, Pinger fell into doubt.   Chu Shuangshuang, who was beside her, also looked astonished after hearing these words.   However, He Song did not care about their thoughts.   He has already taught her the methods.   Whether she can learn it, or is willing to learn, it’s all up to Ping’er herself, and has nothing to do with He Song anymore.   He said a few words in passing, and Ping’er could just listen. Nothing would happen just because of one sentence.   “Thank you for your advice, Senior Brother. I will keep it in mind. Once I have learned Breath Concealment Skill in the future, I will definitely go and learn an   Earth Tunneling Skill..”

Chapter 201 - 201: 201: Demonic Cultivator Translator: 549690339   After a moment of contemplation, Ping’er raised her head, a glint of determination flashed in her eyes.   At the same time, she made a promise to He Song.   She felt there was merit in what He Song had mentioned earlier about the color of tunneling light and all other matters regarding entry into the Immortal City.   At present, while He Song had not discussed with her the key points of controlling a spirit boat, he had shown her a clear path.   To journey.     It didn’t necessarily have to be through the sky nor by steering a spirit boat.   The Earth Tunneling Skill, is also a viable mode of travel.   Although it may seem a bit unconventional for a cultivator, it wins in terms of safety.   Travelling by using Earth Tunneling Skill could not only evade others but also significantly improve one’s safety.   Thus, it was indeed an ideal way to travel.   Especially in a situation where one’s power was insufficient.   Although she had successfully achieved Foundation Establishment and reached the early stage of Foundation Establishment, it’s better to be safe than sorry.   Suppose one day she needed to leave the Immortal Pavilion without being noticed, the Earth Tunneling Skill would naturally make sense.   “My junior sister is thoughtful.”   Ping’er planned to learn not only the Breath Concealment Skill but also the Earth Tunneling Skill.   This approach made He Song admire her even more.   She was really keen on making the most of everything he taught her.   Although she had her reasons for doing so, He Song became even more willing to teach her some survival techniques.   Perhaps, in the future, he would see another survivor besides himself?   He manipulated the spirit boat to fly in the sky.   In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.   During this half a month, He Song steered the spirit boat and had left the influence of the Thick Earth Sect, entering the Seven Star Sect’s sphere of influence.   Therefore, during this half a month He Song steered the spirit boat, the three of them had always been within the sphere of influence of the Thick Earth Sect.   However, the distance from the gate of the Thick Earth Sect had increased substantially.   One day, as He Song steered the spirit boat forward, a lush medicine field appeared in the distance. Spiritual plant farmers were tending various spirit medicines in these fields.   There was an Immortal Pavilion.   “We’ve reached the Herbs Immortal Workshop. We’ve been on the road for quite a while, perhaps my junior sisters would like to rest at the Pavilion. After dusting off, we can continue our journey to Jade Immortal City to meet Master   Qingy Yue.”   “As the Master Guardian of the Herbs Immortal Workshop, I can offer some conveniences.”   He Song steered the spirit boat straight towards the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   Carrying Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang with him was originally just for sharing the journey.   But as they travelled together, He Song began to have some thoughts.   Suppose there were any diabolism practitioners hiding in the newly taken over workshop.    Suppose some secret that he couldn’t handle alone was hidden in there.   Suppose there was a contingency left by the Seven Star Sect.   Suppose…   Although the Thick Earth Sect now almost completely occupies all of the Seven Star Sect’s territory.   Whether the Herbs Immortal Workshop that he needed to guard was in danger, He Song didn’t know.   Better safe than sorry.   In case something happened that he couldn’t handle alone, how could he possibly deal with it?   But…   With the genuine Master Ping’er, his safety would naturally escalate. The combined power of two genuine Masters was far greater than one plus one.   In a case like this, if they had to face together any diabolism practitioner, any secret that one couldn’t deal with, any contingency left by the Seven Star Sect, at least they had the chance to escape.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   It was safer than going to the Herbs Immortal Workshop alone.   Therefore, without a second thought, He Song brought them to the Herbs Immortal Workshop he was supposed to guard and invited them in.   His goal was naturally to ensure his own safety.   As for going all out to escort them to the Jade Immortal City after his own matters were finished, He Song did not have this intention.   Ping’er was a genuine Master, she could take Chu Shuangshuang to the Jade Immortal City.   He didn’t have any other business to see Master Qingy Yue.   It was imperative to quickly take charge at the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   Otherwise, if something happened after he left, he would be the one at a loss.   To ensure that no accidents occurred at the Herbs Immortal Workshop due to his absence, He Song wasn’t planning to escort Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang to Jade Immortal City anymore.   Anyway, the distance to Jade Immortal City and Wolf Immortal Pavilion wasn’t far.   Even a Qi-refining mid stage cultivator wouldn’t face danger over such a short distance.   “Is this the herb immortal workshop that you’re guarding, Elder Brother? Elder Sister, why don’t we go and take a look together?”   “You’re right, Elder Brother, it would be inappropriate to meet the Master straight away after such a long journey.”   “Moreover, your takeover of this immortal workshop can serve as a learning experience for your Junior Sister.”   “By the time Junior Sister takes over the Wolf Immortal Pavilion, she should already know the process of taking over an immortal workshop.”   Upon hearing He Song’s words, Ping’er thought briefly and then, her eyes lighting up, she took the opportunity to ask Chu Shuangshuang who was next to her.   In her view, if she could stay with He Song and go through the process of taking over an immortal workshop together, it would make her feel more prepared when it was her turn to take over the Wolf Immortal Pavilion.   At that time, she would naturally know what to do and when to do it.   At least, with He Song guiding her through the process, she would not be fooled by those from the Wolf Immortal Pavilion. “Alright, we’ll do as you suggest.”   Chu Shuangshuang nodded in agreement.   The way Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang addressed each other did not change even after Ping’er had achieved Foundation Establishment.   The two had always addressed each other as elder and younger sister since they met, indicating they had a good relationship.   Upon hearing this, He Song did not say much more. He just nodded at the two of them, then steered the spirit boat towards the sky above the Herb Immortal Workshop.   The White Jade Boat hovered over the Herb Immortal Workshop.   He Song stayed on the White Jade Boat, standing peacefully as he waited.   Herb Immortal Workshop.    The normally tranquil Herb Immortal Workshop quickly became restless at the sudden arrival of the White Jade Boat.   One cultivator after another emerged from their homes, looking up at the White Jade Boat in the sky.   Those already on the streets turned their shining eyes up towards the White Jade Boat overhead.   Even the spiritual plant farmers who were out working in the fields around the workshop all looked up into the sky, staring at the White Jade Boat where He Song and the others were.   In a short span of time,   the Herb Immortal Workshop was in a state of clamor, as if boiling with excitement.   “A Foundation Establishment Master, it’s the arrival of a Foundation Establishment Master. The previous guardian of this place has disappeared. I bet this is the new guardian…”   “Ah, we used to work under the Seven Star Sect, it had someone watching out for us, those were easier times, but now…”   “Shh, keep it down, if rumor gets out, you’ll be left without a burial place.”   “What’s there to be afraid of? We demon cultivators are inherently different from the orthodox cultivators of the Thick Earth Sect. If we start acting like cowards, we might as well stop cultivating diabolism.”   “Get out of here, if you want to die, go do it yourself. Don’t drag me into this.”   While the low-level loose cultivators and workshop cultivators were abuzz with conversation,   the senior figures at the Herb Immortal Workshop had already gathered together.   Inside a small courtyard filled with cultivators, the atmosphere was tense.   “Let’s go. Regardless of whether this person is the Master who is here to guard the workshop or not, let’s go and greet this Foundation Establishment Master according to our original plan.”   After a moment, an elderly voice spoke.   The high-level cultivators in the courtyard all silently exited the courtyard one after another.   Their expressions were noticeably unusual.   Although their eyes were bright, compared to the other cultivators, theirs were dull and lifeless. As if they were being controlled by someone, like puppets.   As time passed slowly,   all the senior figures in the Herb Immortal Workshop were already waiting in the central mansion within the workshop.   In the sky, He Song retracted his deployed divine sense at this moment.   He opened his eyes.   His gaze swept across the multitude of Qi Refining cultivators below who were keenly anticipating something.   He then glanced back at Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang.   There was an indifferent look in He Song’s eyes.   “This method… is indeed worthy of a practitioner diabolism.”   “However… to think they could conceal this from a Foundation Establishment Master’s examination, are they looking down on the Thick Earth Sect? Or are they looking down on me?”   “It’s good that Ping’er was with me this time. Otherwise, I might have had to secretly rush to the Jade Immortal City and ask for external assistance to encircle and kill this person.”   Just now, as soon as the White Jade Boat hovered over the Herb Immortal Workshop, He Song had extended his divine sense.   He did not use his divine sense to scan each of the cultivators below. A divine sense scan, like a large hand sweeping over, would be immediately detected.   But there was another method that could provide him with all kinds of information about his surroundings without being detected.   Once his divine sense was extended, He Song could vaguely sense the people, objects, and even sounds within a ten-meter radius.   Under these circumstances,   He Song simply needed to extend his divine sense and maintain a certain distance from the surrounding cultivators.   This would allow him to inspect or eavesdrop on a cultivator’s skills, items, and conversations.   As long as there were no magic formations to block his divine sense or prevent it from investigating, this method was infallible.   Upon learning that his divine sense could be used in this way,   He Song had some speculations regarding why Meng Guan and Wei Fan had only hinted at certain ideas but never spoken them out loud when he asked them about the Thick Earth Sect’s recent developments in the past..

Chapter 202 - 202: 202: Master Cang Song Translator: 549690339   Perhaps… Meng Guan and Wei Fan were afraid that Master Fa Xuan would use divine sense to scrutinize them, so they chose to make only frantic insinuations instead of directly warning each other?   He Song was in mid-air, on the White Jade Boat.   He carefully manipulated his divine sense, constantly probing the cultivation situation and conversations of the cultivators below.   By chance, he discovered the high -ranking members of the Immortal Pavilion who seemed to be controlled by someone, just like puppets, in a small courtyard.   At the same time, he happened to hear an old voice.     It was only when he saw the high-ranking members of the Immortal Pavilion coming out of the courtyard one after another, seemingly preparing to greet him, that he realized something was wrong.   He suddenly reacted.   It seems that the original Master Guardian of this Immortal Pavilion might still be controlling these puppets from afar.   However, it is unknown.   Whether this person had left with the main force of the Seven Star Sect.   Or if he is still lurking around the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   If it was the former, he wouldn’t have to worry about cleaning up these puppets.   But if it was the latter.   He Song glanced at Ping’er inconspicuously.   He himself and Pinger.   Two Early Foundation Establishment Cultivators.   Even if faced with a Mid-stage Foundation Establishment Demon Cultivator, they should have the power to fight.   Even if they couldn’t beat him, they could still run away.   After running away, they would directly send a message to Master Qing Yue, asking her to come and help.   He Song did not believe that the three Foundation Establishment Masters, with Master Qing Yue already at Mid-stage Foundation Establishment, couldn’t take down a mere Foundation Establishment Realm Demon Cultivator.   Although he didn’t know which stage this Demon Cultivator was at.   At most, he would be at the Mid-stage Foundation Establishment.   Those at the Late Foundation Establishment Stage basically resided in   Immortal City and would hardly be guardians in the Immortal Pavilion.   Those who could be guardians in the Immortal Pavilion were basically cultivators at the Early Foundation Establishment stage.   Even if there were occasionally Mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators guarding the Immortal Pavilion, it was probably because they had just broken through to the Mid-stage Foundation Establishment.   Once they consolidated their Mid-stage Foundation Establishment strength, they would soon be transferred to guard the Immortal City.   Immortal City was the stronghold for sects or aristocratic families to control the surrounding areas.   Immortal Pavilion was just a branch they extended.   Naturally, the need for Foundation Establishment Realm strength in Immortal City would be greater.   According to He Song’s thoughts, neither he nor Ping’er, two Early Foundation Establishment cultivators, would not be able to run even if this Demon Cultivator was at the Mid-stage Foundation Establishment.   If they couldn’t win, they would run; if they ran away, they would seek external   help.   He really didn’t believe that, within the influence of the Thick Earth Sect, he, an elder of the Thick Earth Sect, wouldn’t be able to deal with a Foundation Establishment Realm Demon Cultivator.   These thoughts flashed through his mind, and after ensuring that he had no threat to his life, He Song finally relaxed and prepared to face the group of puppets controlled by this Demon Cultivator.   He was quite envious of this ability to refine people into puppets.   If he could get his hands on it… he might be able to use this skill to do something in the future.   He thought about what he could do in the future with this skill, which could turn people into puppets.   He Song’s figure quickly landed in the central residence of the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   As soon as he landed.   He immediately heard a roar in his ear.   I am Cheng Yan, Steward of Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, greeting Master. With            Master’s arrival, the Herbs Immortal Workshop will flourish!” “I am Fang Yu, Steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, greeting Master.” “I am Wang Ya, Steward of the Spirit Skill Pavilion, greeting Master.”   “I am…”   With the sound of voices, a large group of people in front of He Song bent their waists and saluted He Song and his companions.   From their words, He Song couldn’t detect anything wrong.   They seemed just like normal cultivators.   However, He Song immediately locked onto an old cultivator among them.   Steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion.   Cheng Yan.   His voice was extremely similar to the old one He Song had eavesdropped on in that small courtyard earlier.   It seemed that it was this person who had ordered the puppets to greet him in the small courtyard.   If He Song hadn’t realized early that almost all of them were puppets, he might have been fooled by them.   However, Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang, who were standing beside him, did not know any of this.   Seeing that a group of people suddenly greeted them with shouts after they landed, Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang’s expressions changed slightly. However, as neither of them was the main focus, they didn’t say anything.   They just looked at He Song.   They wanted to see how He Song would deal with this situation.   From the side.   He Song didn’t directly reveal what he had overheard earlier.   He also didn’t deal a deadly blow to the people in front of him.   He just scanned the crowd.   After realizing that the puppets in the crowd looked no different from ordinary people, except for their eyes that weren’t as lively as other cultivators, He Song became more interested in the_DEV_ method of turning cultivators into puppets.   These puppets.   If he didn’t already know their identities, it would be hard to notice for a while.   Such lifelike puppets might make his security even stronger in the future.   He might actually be able to use this diabolism technique.   With his gaze sweeping past.   He Song memorized the appearance of the non-puppets in the crowd.   Then, he nodded at them.   “No need for more formalities. Who among you is in charge? Step forward and speak.”   As He Song’s words fell.   The crowd immediately stood up straight.   An aged figure walked out of the crowd and shakily approached He Song.   Under the watchful gazes of He Song and the others,   The old figure bowed respectfully to He Song.   Then he spoke.   The hoarse, aged voice reached them.   “Greetings, Master, I am the steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, Cheng Yan. I am unaware of where you have come from or what your purpose is here in the Herbs Immortal Workshop.”   Cheng Yan appeared bent over, his white hair fluttering in the wind, and his frail figure resembled that of an ordinary old man in the mortal world, seemingly able to be knocked down by a gust of wind.   In the Cultivation World, the appearance of a cultivator’s body – whether young or old – could be controlled at will.   Take Meng Guan in the past, for example.   At that time, Meng Guan had given up hope on reaching Foundation Establishment and thus transformed his appearance into that of an old man.   It wasn’t until he successfully achieved Foundation Establishment that he resumed a youthful appearance.   However, Cheng Yan’s current appearance seemed rather ridiculous in He Song’s view.   “I am an elder of the Thick Earth Sect, Master Cang Song. I was sent by Sect   Leader Master Fa Xuan to take charge of Herbs Immortal Workshop.”   “You may call me Master Cang Song.”   He Song casually informed Cheng Yan of his dharma title, which he had thought of beforehand.            The dharma title “Master Cang Song” was carefully chosen by He Song after much consideration. As for its meaning –   “Cang” refers to the sky, while “Song” is He Song’s name.   Joined together, it symbolizes “I am the sky.”   Of course, to others, the dharma title “Master Cang Song” may simply seem to imply He Song’s wish to grow as steadfast and unyielding as a pine tree in his journey along the Immortal Path.   However, they would never know what He Song truly thought while he came up with this dharma title.   As an everlasting being,   He Song comparing himself to the sky was, in fact, elevating its significance.   With He Song’s status as an everlasting being, even if the heavens and earth were to be destroyed, he would remain unscathed and undamaged.   Could the sky even compare?   Nevertheless, He Song knew that such thoughts must never be shared with others.   This was a secret that belonged solely to him.   Regardless of who it was, this secret had to remain buried in his heart forever,   never to be revealed.   When others asked about the meaning of his dharma title,   he would simply say that it was merely a desire to grow as steadfast and unyielding as a pine tree on the Immortal Path, making continuous progress.   As for its other meaning, He Song would never disclose it.   Such a dharma title, depicted him as the sky.   With such irreverence for the heavens in his heart, other cultivators would consider his behavior to be reckless and courting death.   If it were to provoke the wrath of the heavens, even ten He Songs would not be enough to withstand the punishment.   However, as long as He Song kept silent, no harm could come to him.   Evil thoughts alone aren’t evil.   It is only when they are translated into actions that one becomes truly evil.   After all, everyone has fleeting fantasies from time to time.   As long as these fantasies aren’t turned into action, they cannot be called evil.   As long as He Song kept quiet, even the sky itself wouldn’t be able to detect the true meaning behind his dharma title.   “I am the steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, Cheng Yan. I greet Master   Cang Song.”   Upon hearing this, Cheng Yan immediately bowed and saluted He Song.   Behind him, the crowd that had straightened their backs also respectfully bowed to He Song.   Prior to this, they had been uncertain of He Song’s identity.   So, they had not yet referred to themselves as subordinates.   Now that He Song had made his identity clear, they naturally acknowledged themselves as subordinates.   Since He Song claimed to be in charge of the Herbs Immortal Workshop, from now on, he would be like the heavens itself within this small place. As for them, they would be He Song’s subordinates from now on.   Why not submit now if not later?   “All of you, rise. Cheng Yan, come with me. Tell me about the affairs of the Herbs Immortal Workshop.”   Without paying much heed to the high-ranking members of the Workshop bowing before him, He Song spoke casually before leading Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang into the residence behind him.   In the center of every Immortal Pavilion, where the spirit Qi is most concentrated, there is always a grand residence.   This residence is naturally the dwelling place of the Foundation Establishment master in charge of the Immortal Pavilion.   Here, one can enjoy the most abundant spirit Qi, the best location, and even the most comfortable living environment.   Now that He Song had arrived,   this residence at the center of the Herbs Immortal Workshop would naturally be his home.   As the residence’s main door opened,   He Song, along with Ping’er, Chu Shuangshuang, and the trailing Cheng Yan, entered.   The door closed, separating the inside from the outside, creating two distinct worlds.   At this moment, when the interior and exterior were isolated, and the surroundings were quiet,   He Song walked over to Cheng Yan with a warm smile and gentle eyes.   He casually patted Cheng Yan’s hunched figure in a friendly gesture, then spoke up again.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m   “Cheng Yan, from now on, I will leave the trivial matters outside the workshop to you. What do you think…”   “Soul Searching Skill!”        

Chapter 203 - 203 203: Soul Searching Skill (5000-word long ) As He Song whispered in his heart, his big hand gently pressed onto Cheng Yan’s forehead at that moment.   At the same time, as He Song’s mana surged, scenes appeared before him.   Standing there.   Cheng Yan was still in a state of shock and surprise.   He planned to give He Song a thorough report on various matters concerning the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   In order to gain He Song’s trust.     And then make his move.   But unexpectedly, he suddenly felt a darkness in front of his eyes, and He Song’s big hand pressed on his forehead.   Immediately after, an intense pain, as if his soul was being torn apart, came from within his mind.    This sudden pain made Cheng Yan instinctively want to cry out in agony.   However.   Just as his cry was about to escape, He Song, as if knowing his next move, stuffed several spirit stones into his mouth as he opened it to scream, and covered it with his hand to silence his cries.   As a result, although Cheng Yan opened his mouth wide, he could only make muffled sounds.   As for He Song.   At this moment, he had already started to watch Cheng Yan’s memories.   The scene before him.   It left Ping’er, who originally wanted to see what Cheng Yan would report next, and Chu Shuangshuang beside her, completely at a loss.   What’s going on?   Everything had just been fine.   As soon as they entered the mansion, He Song took the initiative to capture Cheng Yan?    Did Cheng Yan commit any taboo against He Song?   Or was it…   Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang exchanged a glance, seeing confusion in each other’s eyes.   They weren’t worried about He Song turning against them.   However, the scene unfolding before them left Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang unsure of what to do.   He Song capturing Cheng Yan.   And doing so right in front of them.   Indicating that He Song didn’t want to hide it from them.   Naturally.   They weren’t too nervous about the sudden scene before them.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   But why exactly was He Song acting like this?   Not knowing what else to do, the two remained standing by He Song, waiting for his next move.   As for He Song.   At this moment, he was searching through Cheng Yan’s memories, finding the information he wanted to know.   As it turned out.

Chapter 204 - 204: 203: Soul Searching Skill (5000 words long )_2 Translator: 549690339   At the same time, He Song was also on high alert in his heart.   From now on, he needed to be even more careful.   Although he was already very cautious, what if Master Ningyin hadn’t left?   With the sinister nature of the Spirit Puppet Skill.   Even if He Song and Ping’er combined forces, they probably would not be able to handle Master Ningyin.     He Song knew from Cheng Yan’s memories that Master Ningyin already possessed a puppet at the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Should a conflict arise, it would likely end in a two-on-two standoff.   Although they might not necessarily lose, there would always be some variables.   These variables were the reasons why He Song needed to be even more careful in the future.   He withdrew the Soul Searching Skill.   Cheng Yan’s body immediately fell to the ground.   A trace of crystalline saliva slipped from his mouth corner.   Accompanied by laugh sounds like a child’s, Cheng Yan’s gaze gradually turned foolish.   Looking at Cheng Yan’s present state.   A hint of satisfaction flashed in He Song’s eyes.   This Soul Searching Skill.   Was indeed as powerful as its reputation suggested.   Whilst inflicting extreme pain on the subject during use.   After its application, it could reduce the subject to a state of imbecility.   If he was not worried that this foolish state would not last long, He Song would hardly have the heart to violence Cheng Yan.   However.   Even if he had no heart to hurt, He Song would prioritize his own safety.    If this person were not killed.   In case he regains his sense when recovered, He Song might have to face another enemy again.   When faced with an enemy, He Song could not afford to be compassionate. A burst of mana shot from his fingertips, and a giant fireball suddenly   enveloped Cheng Yan.   Almost instantly, Cheng Yan was reduced to a pile of ashes, which He Song casually stored in his storage bag for future use.   After doing all this.   He Song’s gaze turned to Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang on the side.   “Early when we were in the sky, I found this man suspicious, and then took advantage of his off-guard moment to use the Soul Searching Skill. Indeed, he’s a diabolism thief left here by the Seven Star Sect, plotting in secret.”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m   “Please wait here, juniors, let me completely resolve this matter before I come back to explain.”   Without further explanation, He Song simply stated the reason and then turned to open the mansion’s main door and left.   In his wake.   Upon hearing this, both Pinger and Chu Shuangshuang didn’t wait in place, but followed He Song out of the mansion’s main door and once again stood in front of the group of puppets.   At this moment.   Cheng Yan was dead.   The puppets he had been controlling had naturally all fallen to the ground and remained motionless.   This scene terrified the few cultivators who hadn’t been converted into puppets.   Upon seeing He Song emerge from the mansion, the cultivators who hadn’t been turned into puppets quickly prostrated themselves again, saluting He Song.   At the same time, they didn’t forget to distance themselves from the current situation.   “Subordinate Fang Yu, Steward of the Spirit Construction Pavilion, pays respects to the Master, 1…1…1 have no idea what went wrong with them, please look into it, Master.”   “Subordinate Wang Ya, Steward of the Spirit Skill Pavilion, pays respects to the Master, please look into it.”   “Subordinate Cao Tang, Steward of the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, pays respects to the Master, please look into it.”   Among the Herbs Immortal Workshop, the only remaining Qi-refining late stage cultivators were these three now standing in front of He Song.   The rest.   Had all been turned into puppets by Cheng Yan’s master, Master Ningyin.   At that moment, the puppets lay scattered all over the ground, without their master, they could no longer stand or act.    If he wanted to make use of these puppets.   Perhaps He Song himself would have to learn the “Spirit Puppet Skill” before he could control them.   At the moment.   He Song was helpless about this.   “Fang Yu, I appoint you as the Supervisor of the Immortal Pavilion, you’ll manage the Immortal Pavilion on my behalf from now on.”   “The other two will follow Fang Yu’s orders.”   “From now on, report here once a month, you may leave.”   Without saying much to the three, He Song casually named Fang Yu, and then assigned all the affairs of the Immortal Pavilion to him.   As for whether Fang Yu would seize power later… That was the Cultivation World.   He Song, as a Foundation Establishment Master, could appoint anyone to manage the Immortal Pavilion, he didn’t necessarily need Fang Yu.   If Fang Yu really wanted to seize power.   He might have to face the bloody crackdown that comes with the fury of a Foundation Establishment Master.   He had the power to control the lives of countless people around him.   Thus, He Song didn’t take the power he had devolved too seriously.   Now.   He just wanted to get back to his mansion as soon as possible, say goodbye to Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang, and then immediately study his newly gained “Spirit Puppet Skill”.   The emergence of the “Spirit Puppet Skill” was enough to rapidly enhance He Song’s combat power.   Maybe, when he successfully crafts a Foundation Establishment Realm puppet, it will also be a time for his battle strength to skyrocket.   At that time, if there’s any unexpected situation.   Having one or even several Foundation Establishment Realm puppets to assist.   Will greatly increase He Song’s safety.   Therefore, for He Song now, studying the “Spirit Puppet Skill” as soon as possible is his top priority.   As for these three people in front of him.   Let’s just deal with them casually.   “Yes sir! I will strictly follow the Master’s orders and manage the Herbs Immortal Workshop in good order!”   Front and center, Fang Yu responded after hearing He Song’s appointment.   Although he didn’t know why Cheng Yan never made any noise after entering the mansion with He Song.   Those around him who were at the late stage of Qi Refining had all fallen, leaving only three including himself..

Chapter 205 - 205: 203: Soul Searching Skill (5000word long ) _3 Translator: 549690339   But the opportunity was right in front of him, and Fang Yu could no longer care about these matters.   After being valued by a Foundation Establishment Master and appointed as Supervisor of the Immortal Pavilion, Fang Yu felt that he had reached the peak of his life at this moment.   At this moment, Fang Yu couldn’t care less about anything else.   He was completely immersed in the joy of being valued by a Master.   With Fang Yu expressing his gratitude continuously,     He Song waved his hand slightly.   Then he collected all the lifeless puppets lying on the ground into his storage bag.   Storage bags couldn’t hold living things.   But these puppets were not alive.   So they could be stored.   After doing all this, He Song waved his hand, indicating for Fang Yu and the others to leave.   Then he turned around and led Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang into the mansion for the second time. As the mansion’s door closed,   The inside of the mansion and the outside world were again separated.   He Song’s divine sense reached out, scanning the entire mansion after bypassing Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang around him.   After sensing everything inside the mansion, He Song naturally understood its structure.   Even the secret passages and hidden facilities within the mansion were all clear to him.   As such, He Song quickly led Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang to a hall.   The three of them sat down according to their rank.   He Song casually waved his hand, his mana controlling the teapot, and poured a cup of tea for each of the three people.   As the scent of tea gradually wafted throughout the hall, The atmosphere between the three quietly started to calm down.   “Senior Brother, what about Cheng Yan…?”   It wasn’t until this moment that Ping’er opened her mouth to ask about Cheng   Yan.   Although He Song had already explained a little bit about it to her earlier, it was only a vague explanation.    As for why He Song could detect Cheng Yan’s strangeness in advance,   And why he suddenly attacked and killed Cheng Yan after bringing him into the mansion,   And why, when he left the mansion again, those Qi-refining late stage cultivators outside the mansion were all lying on the ground in disarray,   And even He Song casually waved his hand and collected them all into his storage bag,   All of these events one after another,   Contained what kind of secret?   With curiosity, Ping’er looked at He Song, wanting to hear his explanation.   Chu Shuangshuang, on the side, also had a curious look on her face.   “Do you remember when I was hovering with the spirit boat over the Immortal Pavilion?”   Instead of directly answering Ping’er’s question, He Song asked back.   Hearing this, Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang nodded immediately.   At that time, He Song indeed controlled the spirit boat and lingered above the Herbs Immortal Workshop for a long time.   Originally, they thought He Song was just enjoying the feeling of looking down from above.   However, now that He Song mentioned it,   The two of them instantly sensed that something was wrong.   This matter,   Could it be that there was some hidden secret?   “While hovering with the spirit boat, I already sent out my divine sense, scanning all the courtyards within the inner circle of the Immortal Pavilion below.”   “Of course, my divine sense didn’t come into contact with anyone, just giving a rough scan.”   “This scan allowed me to eavesdrop on some secrets.”   “That’s why when I first saw Cheng Yan, I knew there was something wrong with him.”   As he spoke, He Song waved his hand,   And several puppets suddenly appeared in the hall.   At this moment,   Even though these puppets had been placed in He Song’s storage bag for quite some time,   Their expressions and appearances still looked like those of real people, vividly lifelike   If it weren’t for the fact that they were now collapsed on the ground, no one would think that they were actually puppets.   Releasing the puppets,    He Song saw Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang’s puzzled faces and spoke again.   “As you can see, these people are puppets, controlled by Cheng Yan. I noticed this when I first landed.”   “Upon his death, these puppets lost their control and naturally became like this.”   “According to the information I obtained using the Soul Searching Skill, ”   “These puppets were the property of Cheng Yan’s Master, Master Ningyin. Master Ningyin specialized in puppet making. He refined all the Qi Refining late-stage cultivators in the Herbs Immortal Workshop into puppets and handed them to Cheng Yan.”   “Master Ningyin and Cheng Yan are both disciples of the Seven Star Sect.”   “Leaving Cheng Yan here was the Seven Star Sect’s unwillingness to give up, wanting to leave a nail here for their future return.”   “That’s why I used the Soul Searching Skill on him to gain more information.”   Shaking his head and putting the puppets back into the storage bag, He Song finished speaking and looked at Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang.   After He Song’s explanation, the series of events became clearer to Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang.   First, He Song sent out his divine sense while hovering in the sky, eavesdropping on secrets and confirming Cheng Yan’s abnormality. Then, after landing, he confirmed the identity of these puppets.   As such,   He Song naturally began to take action against Cheng Yan.   Indeed,   After Cheng Yan’s death, the puppets he controlled all fell to the ground.   At the same time, He Song, who had used the Soul Searching Skill on Cheng Yan, naturally obtained more information.   It could be said that,   He Song’s actions were all due to his extreme caution, sending his divine sense out before landing and scanning the situation within the Immortal Pavilion below.   If someone else were in the same situation, they might not even be aware of Cheng Yan’s abnormality, let alone the puppets he controlled.   For example, Ping’er.   She never thought about these things,   Only following He Song here, never even sending out her divine sense.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com   Having understood everything, Ping’er’s gaze at He Song revealed a hint of admiration.   “Senior Brother He Song is really cautious. If he hadn’t noticed all this, Cheng   Yan would surely cause trouble in the future. By that time…”   Secretly sighing in her mind and imagining the scene of the Seven Star Sect’s counterattack, Ping’er felt a chill down her spine.   It’s difficult to guard against a thief within the family.   Under the premise that Cheng Yan had gained the trust of the Foundation Establishment Master ,   With Cheng Yan around, the Herbs Immortal Workshop would most likely never know peace in the future.   Only when He Song exposed him would the Herbs Immortal Workshop quickly stabilize.   Otherwise, this man could really stir up trouble here..

Chapter 206 - 206: 204: Spirit Puppet Skill (5000 -word Big Chapter) Translator: 549690339   At the same time, Ping’er couldn’t help but ponder in her heart.   If it were her, could she be as cautious as He Song?   After thinking about it.   Ping’er shook her head.   She felt there was still a huge gap between her and He Song.     However, Ping’er did not feel discouraged, only realizing that she needed to learn He Song’s caution seriously.   Otherwise.   She was afraid that she would just be stabbed in the back by her subordinates while being the guardian of the Immortal Pavilion.   That would be a big joke.   Just like what He Song had experienced this time, if it happened to her, she might not have noticed it, right?   With this thought in mind, Ping’er spoke up.   “So that’s how it is, Senior Brother is truly wise and far-sighted. If it were me, I’m afraid I wouldn’t know how to do it this way, and I wouldn’t even be able to detect this person’s abnormality.”   “It seems there’s still a lot for Ping’er to learn.”   “After I finish learning Breath Concealment Skill and Earth Tunneling Skill, I will definitely go on to learn Soul Searching Skill.”   He Song didn’t know what Ping’er was thinking.   He didn’t know why she could draw the idea to learn the Soul Searching Skill from this matter.   He also didn’t know that Ping’er already had a great interest in his caution.   Upon hearing Ping’er’s words, He Song merely smiled and didn’t say anything more.   Now.   He had made everything clear to both of them.   Next.   After washing away their dust, they would continue their journey to Jade Immortal City, right?Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   Once the two of them left.   He could then focus on practicing his newly acquired “Spirit Puppet Skill”.    It was just that he didn’t know.   What kind of puppet-making methods were recorded in the “Spirit Puppet Skill”?   He Song was thinking about the “Spirit Puppet Skill”.   However, he didn’t neglect Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang.   After arranging their accommodations, he then took the two of them out of his mansion, and the three began to stroll in Herbs Immortal Workshop under the identity of loose cultivators.   Herbs Immortal Workshop.   As the name suggests.   It was named after a certain spirit grass.   He Song and the others didn’t know the name of the spirit grass at first.   Until.   The three of them found several Yin Soul Grass with a gloomy aura in the Stall   Section of Herbs Immortal Workshop.   Upon inquiry, they finally learned the origin of the name of Herbs Immortal Workshop.   This spirit grass was called Yin Soul Grass. Once planted, it could continuously gather gloomy energy and form a cluster of gloomy aura within the grass.   This gloomy aura had great use for demon cultivators, their artifacts, and all other things they used.   For demon cultivators.   Yin Soul Grass, like spirit rice, was an indispensable item in their cultivation.   Spirit rice could make their cultivation speed faster.   While Yin Soul Grass could bring significant improvement to their artifacts, other consumables, and even their cultivation base.   The gloomy aura could be absorbed and refined into their own cultivation base.   It could also be integrated into artifacts, enhancing their power.   Or into other consumables, increasing their power as well.   One could say.   Yin Soul Grass was a solid currency among demon cultivators.   Herbs Immortal Workshop used to be called Ghosts Immortal Mansion.   The name was derived from Yin Soul Grass as well.   When He Song looked at Herbs Immortal Workshop from a distance, the spirit grass he saw in the medicine fields were mostly Yin Soul Grass. Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang naturally found this eye-opening.    Even He Song.   When he first saw this Yin Soul Grass, he couldn’t help but feel surprised.   He had been in the Thick Earth Sect’s territory for decades.   But he had never heard of this spirit grass called Yin Soul Grass.   It seemed.   It should be due to Yin Soul Grass not having much effect on ordinary cultivators of immortality.   The effects of Yin Soul Grass were mostly aimed at demon cultivators, which were almost non-existent in the territory of the Thick Earth Sect, so it was quite normal.   However, now that the Seven Star Sect’s territory had been completely taken over by the Thick Earth Sect.   Various demon cultivation skills and resources in the former territory of the Seven Star Sect would probably be replaced with resources needed by righteous cultivators.   This Yin Soul Grass would most likely disappear from Herbs Immortal Workshop in the future.   The future Herbs Immortal Workshop might become a workshop dedicated to producing spirit medicine.   After leading Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang around Herbs Immortal Workshop ,   They both said farewell to He Song.   As for this, He Song didn’t retain them.   After watching them leave the workshop,   He Song quickly returned to the mansion in the center of the workshop and began to prepare for his upcoming secluded cultivation.   As the Master Guardian of Herbs Immortal Workshop,   He Song had long known about the responsibilities of a Master Guardian.   Upon becoming the guardian of a workshop, one must sit in the workshop and protect it from attacks by evil cultivators. That is the most important duty of a Master Guardian.   As for other things, such as managing the workshop’s taxes, departments, and other tasks.   These matters would be handled directly by the Immortal City and the Supervisor of the Immortal Pavilion. They would even assist the Supervisor of the Immortal Pavilion in managing the entire workshop.   As for the Master Guardian of the workshop.   Apart from providing armed protection, one could really not care about other things if they didn’t want to.   Therefore.   Knowing the responsibilities of a Master Guardian of a workshop beforehand,   He Song appointed a Supervisor of the Immortal Pavilion to manage the entire workshop.   As for himself.   Of course, it was secluded cultivation, making himself stronger and stronger.   Back in the mansion.   He Song waved his hand..

Chapter 207 - 207: 204: Spirit Puppet Skill (5000 words) _2 Translator: 549690339   An Array Disk and five Array Banners appeared in front of He Song.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m   The Array Disk and Array Banners hovered quietly, as if invisible hands were holding them in place.   These were used to set up the Spirit-Gathering Array.   As He Song’s thoughts moved, his divine sense probed out.   Instantly, the Array Disk and Array Banners before him transformed into streaks of light, falling into the mansion below him.     In this way, He Song formed hand seals, and a Spirit-Gathering Array was set   up.   Placing this Spirit-Gathering Array inside the mansion would serve to increase the concentration of the spirit Qi in the area.   He Song casually waved his hand again.   An Array Disk and six Array Banners materialized before him.   This set of Array Disk and Array Banners were needed to set up the Smoke Array.   Although being inside his own Immortal Pavilion, He Song did not need to worry about his secrets being discovered or anyone barging into his mansion.   However, he still maintained his extreme caution.   The spirit Qi gathered by the Spirit-Gathering Array would definitely be much denser than the spirit Qi around him at the moment. Ordinary mortals might not be able to sense it.   But cultivators could naturally sense it.    If someone discovered the secret within his mansion, He Song might have to take preemptive action to erase that person from existence.   Otherwise, that person might use this information as leverage and share it with others.   If this caused any consequences, it was something that He Song didn’t want to see happen.   In order to save some lives and avoid making things too troublesome, He Song figured that it would be better to set up a Smoke Array to hide the concentration of spirit Qi here.   Moreover, after setting up the Smoke Array, he could feel more at ease when he was in seclusive cultivation.   Once he set up the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array inside his mansion, his security would naturally increase significantly during his secluded cultivation.   With a thought, He Song’s Array Disk and Array Banners used for setting up the Smoke Array turned into streams of light and flew towards various spots around the mansion.   As soon as the Array Disk and Array Banners had settled, the hand seals in He Song’s hands changed to adapt accordingly.   Swiftly, an invisible barrier wrapped around He Song’s entire mansion.   Witnessing this, He Song casually sprinkled a generous amount of spirit stones to replenish the Smoke Array and Spirit-Gathering Array before stepping inside the mansion.   The Spirit-Gathering Array gradually increased the concentration of spirit Qi within the mansion.   He Song entered a quiet room inside the mansion.   Sitting on a cushion, thoughts about the “Spirit Puppet Skill” instantly raced through his mind.   Spirit Puppet Skill—named after spirit puppets, the puppets created with this skill naturally possessed a certain degree of spirituality.   After carefully reading the introduction and various puppet-making methods recorded in the Spirit Puppet Skill, He Song gained some understanding of his newly- acquired skill.   Several puppet-making methods were recorded in the Spirit Puppet Skill.   The first method was turning cultivators into spirit puppets, like Master Ningyin did.   The second method involved using various hard materials and other precious materials to create strangely-shaped puppets.   The third method involved infusing various hard materials to create human – shaped puppets.    The fourth method allowed one to transform beasts into spirit puppets.   Besides these puppet-making methods, there were also techniques to control puppets and some skills to temporarily enhance their combat powers.   However, the skills recorded in the Spirit Puppet Skill were, at maximum, suitable for the Foundation Establishment Realm.   As for puppet-making skills above the Foundation Establishment realm, none were mentioned.   After reading through all the methods once, He Song gradually formed an understanding of the Spirit Puppet Skill.   “This Spirit Puppet Skill should be the secret skill that allowed Master Ningyin to gain fame.”   “However, making Foundation Establishment Realm puppets requires either the corpses of Foundation Establishment cultivators or other precious materials.”   “Precious materials are hard to find, and Foundation Establishment corpses are similarly scarce. Even if I learn it, I might not be able to make them in a short period of time.”   “It’s better to first learn the techniques to control puppets from the Spirit Puppet Skill, release those puppets stored in my storage bag, and then learn the rest.”   “Having those puppets unused in the storage bag is a waste.”   “It’s better to put them to good use.”   Having made up his mind, He Song quickly closed his eyes and began studying the various Puppet Control Skills recorded in the Spirit Puppet Skill.   The Puppet Control Skills recorded in the Spirit Puppet Skill weren’t simple.   However, it was for this reason that the Puppet Control Skills in the Spirit Puppet Skill were extraordinarily effective.   As He Song continued to study, he quickly understood why Cheng Yan, a   seventh-tier Qi Refining cultivator, could control nearly ten late-stage Qi Refining puppets.   Cheng Yan’s master had left him with almost seven late-stage Qi Refining puppets.   Theoretically, a seventh-tier Qi refining cultivator should be able to effortlessly control one or two late-stage Qi refining puppets.   However, if they controlled too many puppets, the mental consumption would be higher, and the puppet control would become slightly off.   Therefore, most cultivators who specialized in controlling puppets for battles only controlled one or two puppets at most.   They wouldn’t control seven puppets at once like Cheng Yan.   Doing so would consume too much mental energy and cause the puppets’ control to become uncoordinated, causing more harm than good..

Chapter 208 - 208: 204: Spirit Puppet Skill (5000-word Chapter) _3 Translator: 549690339   However, using the puppet control skills recorded in the Spirit Puppet Skill greatly reduces this shortcoming.   The puppet control skills recorded in the Spirit Puppet Skill.   It can directly give commands at the core of the puppet, and the commands in the core will be completed by the puppet alone.   In this way, the puppet controller only needs to move their thoughts, and the puppet can make the actions they want.   Even in battle, it can allow more puppets to help out.     This is also the reason why the Spirit Puppet Skill is named as such.   The puppets refined by the Spirit Puppet Skill contain a trace of spirituality in their core.   With the manipulation of puppet control skills, the puppets refined by the   Spirit Puppet Skill are more spiritual than those refined by other methods.   He Song has not yet learned the specific puppet refining skills, so he does not know what is hidden in the puppet refining skills that makes the puppets refined by the Spirit Puppet Skill more spiritual than other puppets.   Nevertheless, He Song is still somewhat amazed at the Puppet Control Techniques in the Spirit Puppet Skill.   As He Song becomes more proficient in the Puppet Control Techniques in the Spirit Puppet Skill, his research becomes more thorough.   Time.   It begins to flow slowly at this moment.   In the blink of an eye.   He Song has spent a full month in the mansion at the center of Herbs Immortal Workshop.   During this month, most of He Song’s time was spent immersed in the study of the Puppet Control Techniques in the Spirit Puppet Skill, besides cultivation.   As of today.   One month has passed.   He Song’s practice of the Puppet Control Techniques in the Spirit Puppet Skill has basically become proficient.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))   At this point, He Song can release the puppets from his storage bag and use the Puppet Control Techniques to make them perform many actions.   Outside.   A figure cautiously approached He Song’s mansion.   This man is Fang Yu.   He was just appointed by He Song a month ago as the Supervisor of the Immortal Pavilion, to manage the entire Immortal Pavilion on He Song’s behalf.            During this month, Fang Yu’s behavior has been quite proper.   At least when He Song occasionally used his divine sense to eavesdrop on his conversations with others, he did not find any mistakes.   Thus, He Song was relatively assured of him, only occasionally stretching his divine sense to keep track of Fang Yu’s recent activities.   Fang Yu came to He Song’s mansion today.   It was also because He Song had instructed him a month ago to report to him every month.   However.   Just as Fang Yu cautiously approached He Song’s mansion and hesitated whether to knock on the door or not.   With a creak, the door of He Song’s mansion suddenly opened at this moment.   The mansion door opened, and a person walked out.   “The master ordered that you come again next month.”   As a cold voice came, Fang Yu’s gaze also looked towards the direction of the voice.   At this sight.   A layer of cold sweat appeared on Fang Yu’s back.   This person… How could he resemble one of the Qi-refining late stage cultivators who suddenly fell to the ground and did not get up a month ago?   Didn’t he die?   Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been casually put into He Song’s storage bag that time.   But,   How did this person suddenly appear in front of him, and also came out of He Song’s mansion to relay a message to him?   For a moment, Fang Yu felt his mind filled with doubts.   He wanted to ask, but seeing the indifferent expression on the other party’s face, he opened his mouth but ultimately did not ask his doubts.   “Yes, subordinate takes leave.”   In the world of cultivating immortality, there are many strange cultivation skills, spells, and things.   Although this person seemed to have died once, Fang Yu was only shocked in his heart when he first saw him.   Immediately after, Fang Yu’s heart was filled with doubts.   With this doubt.   Fang Yu quickly left He Song’s mansion door after bidding his farewell.   But in his heart.   Fang Yu had already begun to ponder the ins and outs of this matter.    A person who had died once.   Suddenly appearing again.   It’s hard not to associate it with something.   Fang Yu quickly thought of the previous Master Guardian of the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   Master Ningyin.   Master Ningyin was famous for his puppet art, and the puppets he made were lifelike and quite famous in several surrounding Immortal Pavilions.   Then, where did He Song learn the puppet art from?   Or could it be that the Foundation Establishment Master in the mansion is still Master Ningyin?   Then where had Master Cang Song, who appointed him as the Supervisor of the Immortal Pavilion, gone?   Could it be…   The conjectures in his mind gradually became bolder, and Fang Yu felt the cold sweat on his back increasing.   After thinking for a long time, Fang Yu hurried back to his residence.   In the mansion.   He Song was unaware that Fang Yu had even begun to doubt whether he was dead or alive in his heart.   If He Song knew what Fang Yu was thinking.   He would probably come out of seclusion directly and strip Fang Yu of his Supervisory position.   To vent the hatred in his heart.   After seeing Fang Yu leave, He Song also controlled the puppet at the door of the mansion to close the door and returned to the mansion.   Inside He Song’s mansion.   In order to master the Puppet Control Skills in the Spirit Puppet Skill faster, He Song has released all of the seven puppets in his storage bag, all of which he controls to move around the mansion.   In this way.   While multitasking with one mind and seven puppets, He Song could quickly master the Puppet Control Skills.   There are also many benefits for controlling the spirit puppets he refined for future battles.   However.   Even by using the Puppet Control Techniques in the Spirit Puppet Skill, He Song still found it somewhat strenuous to control such a large number of puppets at the same time.   Usually, He Song could manage to control this many puppets in great detail.   But if he had to divide his attention to control so many puppets during a battle, it might be overwhelming.   By He Song’s estimate.   After becoming proficient in the Puppet Control Techniques, at most, he could control three to four puppets in battle.   This is only about twice the number of puppets compared to regular puppet control techniques.   Ordinary puppet control techniques can only control one or two puppets in battle.   The Puppet Control Techniques in the Spirit Puppet Skill can control three to four puppets in battle..

Chapter 209 - 209: 205 Four Years Later (5000 -word ) Translator: 549690339   As for One Heart Seven Uses… it could only be used for daily life, making life more comfortable by manipulating puppets, but not for combat.   Even so,   He Song felt quite satisfied in his heart.   Three to four puppets,   If all of them were Foundation Establishment Realm puppets, even if they only possessed Foundation Establishment Early Stage combat potential, they would be a great help to him.     With this help, He Song’s safety would greatly increase.   In the future, even when he walked outside, facing other Foundation   Establishment cultivators, he might be able to overpower them by force.   After sending Fang Yu away, He Song quickly immersed himself in the practice of puppet-making once more.   This time,   With He Song having already mastered the Puppet Control Art, his seclusive cultivation time naturally lengthened a lot.   He did not need to deal with minor matters himself and could instead control the puppets to handle them.   This greatly improved his efficiency during seclusive cultivation for He Song.   Without having to worry about being disturbed by anyone during his seclusive cultivation.   In this way,   Time began to slowly pass as He Song continued his seclusive cultivation.   In the blink of an eye,   Four years had quietly passed.   During these four years,   He Song had stayed in seclusive cultivation at his residence, not caring much about affairs at the Herbs Immortal Workshop.    However, even so, nothing major happened at the Herbs Immortal Workshop with a Foundation Establishment Master overseeing it.   It was just that, because this place had been occupied by the Thick Earth Sect, the cultivation skills sold in the Spirit Skill Pavilion had all been replaced by Thick Earth Sect’s cultivation skills.   Previously, the cultivation skills of the Seven Star Sect, even the skills, had been completely removed.   The Thick Earth Sect was of the righteous path.   It was impossible for their domain to continue to promote diabolism like before.   However, because of this, many Demon Cultivators fled to other regions controlled by Demon Sects.   Demon Cultivators leaving the Immortal Pavilion.   Naturally, a certain level of shock was created.   For example, the unsalable artifacts in the Artifacts Pavilion.   The accumulated spirit amulets in the Spirit Amulet Pavilion.   Even in the Spiritual Medicine Pavilion, Yin Soul Grass was met with indifference.   As Demon Cultivators left one after another, these consequences gradually surfaced.   However, as Demon Cultivators left one by one,F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com   More and more Loose cultivators began to cultivate Thick Earth Sect’s cultivation skills in the vicinity of the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   In addition, those who became Loose cultivators from the Mortal World generally cultivated Thick Earth Sect’s cultivation skills.   These righteous cultivators soon began to emerge in large numbers within the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   As time continued to pass, the cultivation skills practiced by those cultivators who became Loose cultivators from the Mortal World were almost all transformed into cultivation skills of the Thick Earth Sect.   This was not because the cultivation skills of the Thick Earth Sect made it easier for people to draw Qi into their bodies.   On the contrary, it was because the Thick Earth Sect began to establish its own mortal dynasty in this area after occupying the area which was once controlled by the Seven Star Sect.   The mortal dynasty supported by the Thick Earth Sect quickly overthrew the previous mortal dynasty supported by the Seven Star Sect.   Soon after, the Thick Earth Sect’s cultivation skills, power, and treatment began to be promoted within the dynasty.   It was precisely because of the upheaval within the mortal dynasty,   That almost all the newly born Loose cultivators, who successfully drew Qi into their bodies, cultivated the Thick Earth Sect’s cultivation skills.   This is one of the first things that must be done after a power occupies a new territory.    Only in this way can the new territory be quickly harvested and the continuous guidance of the newly born cultivators within the territory be possible.   When these cultivators reach the Qi Refining late stage, won’t they have to buy the Crumbled Jade Powder released by the Thick Earth Sect to increase their cultivation speed?   When these cultivators reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, won’t they have to join the Thick Earth Sect, which they have always heard about, to enjoy a higher status and treatment?   When these cultivators possess special skills, won’t they have to join the Thick Earth Sect and become genius disciples that others can only look up to?   When these cultivators…   It could be said that after occupying this new region, the Thick Earth Sect’s transformation of the region has been steadily advancing.   However, all of this had little to do with He Song.   Implementing these measures was basically done by people from the Immortal City. He only needed to enjoy the results.   As the number of righteous cultivators increased,   There were also significant changes within the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   The planting of spirit rice rapidly increased, and the cultivation of spirit grass and spirit plants was quickly promoted.   Even the atmosphere, that had once been full of the fierce aura of diabolism a few years ago, began to calm down and become peaceful.   Although this calm and peace was only relative.   This place, even today, was far more dangerous than the original territory of the Thick Earth Sect.   But compared to the previous era of rampant Demon cultivation, the current Herbs Immortal Workshop was already much safer.   Four years passed in the blink of an eye.   In these four years, He Song’s cultivation also moved forward, and the distance to the Mid-Stage Foundation Establishment was no longer as distant as before.   On a certain day,   He Song, who had been sitting in the quiet room, showed a trace of joy on his face at this moment.   “The Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array is complete!”   Looking at the Array Disk covered in dense array patterns before his eyes and the nine Array Banners, He Song breathed a deep sigh of relief in his heart. At the same time, a great sense of satisfaction surged in his heart.   The Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array,   Was an attacking Array Skill recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction.   When spirit stones were put in to activate it, it could even threaten a   Foundation Establishment Master if there were enough spirit stones.   The Five Phases Array. which had both offensive and defensive capabilities.   recorded in the Array Tao Introduction, could even wear down a Qi Refining Late Stage cultivator to death if there were enough spirit stones..

Chapter 210 - 210: 205: Four Years Later (5000-word Big Chapter)_2 Translator: 549690339   The Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array, recorded in the Array Tao Primary Introduction, which focuses only on the kill array, can naturally pose a threat to Foundation Establishment Masters.   Although the spirit stones needed for the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array to operate at full power are vast, it is precisely because of this enormous consumption of spirit stones that it possesses the terrifying power to threaten Foundation Establishment Masters.   He Song has been studying the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array for several years.   Before he reached Foundation Establishment, He Song had already studied it for some time.   Now, after spending four years researching at the Herbs Immortal Workshop, he has finally mastered this Array Skill and can deploy it at will.     As a result, He Song has naturally added another layer to his capabilities.   Having just completed a Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array, He Song quickly stood up.   Quickly.   He arrived at the very center of the mansion.   With a glance at the mansion that looked no different from four years ago, He Song waved his hand.   Immediately, the Array Disk and Array Banner required to set up the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array transformed into beams of light and shot out in all directions.   In the blink of an eye.   The Array Disk and Array Banner were in their respective positions.   As He Song cast spells with his fingers, a powerful killing array enveloped his mansion at this moment.   However, because He Song had also set up a Smoke Array in his own mansion, this powerful killing aura was not leaked out at all.   Everyone outside was completely unaware of He Song’s recent array deployment.   Setting up a kill array in his own mansion.   After making himself even more secure during seclusive cultivation, He Song quickly left the center of the mansion.   He entered a hall.    As the scent of tea filled the room, He Song’s mind was filled with the gains he had made over the past four years.   In these four years.   He Song has not only completely built a Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array.   But also fully mastered the Qi Observing Skill.   He learned the Qi Observing Skill not because he wanted to use this Pupil Skill for other purposes.   It was just that.   While researching the Spirit Puppet Skill, he found that if he wanted to make puppets, he must learn a simple refining skill.   The refining skill for spirit puppets requires the assistance of the Qi Observing Skill.   With the help of the Qi Observing Skill, learning the refining skill in the Spirit Puppet Skill would be twice as effective with half the effort.   For this reason.   Since the Qi Observing Skill was a skill He Song needed to learn anyway.   After some thought, He Song naturally incorporated the study of the Qi Observing Skill into his plans.   Over the course of two years.   While continuing his research on the Spirit Puppet Skill, He Song cultivated the Qi Observing Skill to the point where he could use it freely without losing any power.   Only then did he focus all his attention on studying the Spirit Puppet Skill.   Unfortunately.   He Song is currently still researching the puppet-making method in the Spirit Puppet Skill and has not yet begun to make puppets.   He could not try the human puppet-making method without finding the corpse of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.   As for the method of making puppets using precious materials, He Song has been in seclusive cultivation and has temporarily shelved the idea due to lack of materials.   Since both methods of refining spirit puppets cannot be implemented.   He Song could only resort to studying the seven puppets he had obtained from Cheng Yan.   It’s worth noting that these puppets are all at the Qi-refining late stage, but because of their different cultivation levels in their lifetime, the combat power they can display after being refined into puppets is naturally somewhat different.   Those who had a ninth-tier Qi Refining cultivation in their lifetime can display a seventh-tier Qi Refining strength.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m    Those who had an eighth-tier of Qi Refining cultivation in their lifetime can display a sixth -tier Qi Refining strength.   Those who had a seventh-tier Qi Refining cultivation in their lifetime can display a fifth-tier Qi Refining strength.   In short, after refining the corpses of Qi Refining cultivators into puppets, their strength will drop by two minor realms.   According to the Spirit Puppet Skill.   This decline in strength can be improved through refining skill and precious materials.   The more perfect the refining skill, and the more powerful the precious materials added to the puppet, the less noticeable the decrease in the strength of the refined puppet.   It is clear that these seven puppets were not carefully refined.   But He Song didn’t care too much.   Master Ningyin had refined these seven puppets out of a desire to disgust the Thick Earth Sect when he decided to leave.   Not being dedicated to it was a perfectly normal thing.   If he had spent a lot of effort on it, He Song might have had to doubt his motives.   Putting down the teacup.   He Song looked into the distance, about to continue his seclusive cultivation, learning more skills and making his strength even stronger.   But he suddenly remembered the cave mansion he had built outside the Thick Earth Sect for his Foundation Establishment.   In his cave mansion.   It seemed that there were several arrays, and within those arrays were a spiritual field and herb garden.   Although he had left enough spirit stones for those arrays when he left, he didn’t know if those arrays could still maintain their operation at this moment, since so much time had passed.   At this thought.   The image of a little turtle suddenly flashed through He Song’s mind.   It seemed… he had raised a little turtle?   After so many years, he didn’t know if that little turtle had turned into a tortoise shell.   Besides that, there are also over a hundred acres of spiritual fields left by He Song within the sphere of influence of the Thick Earth Sect.   However, it has been four whole years since He Song left the Thick Earth Sect.   Such a long time.   The Illusion Array at the place where the spiritual fields are located should have lost their effect by now, right?   ‘I just don’t know if those hundreds of spiritual fields have been discovered by others..’

Chapter 211 - 211: 205: Four Years Later (5000-word long )_3 Translator: 549690339   If it was discovered, would the Thick Earth Sect intervene again?   As these thoughts flashed through his mind, He Song’s expression subtly changed.   It seemed.   It was time to return and deal with all these matters.   As time passed, the Illusion Array he had once set up would eventually be completely dissipated due to the consumption of spirit stones, revealing the spirit fields hidden underneath.     It might indeed cause some unnecessary trouble.   Those hundreds of acres of spirit fields he had hidden might be discovered by others, and thus attract the investigation of the Thick Earth Sect.   By that time.   Although it was certain that the investigation would not be traced back to him, better safe than sorry.   He would go there personally.   No matter whether those spirit fields were discovered by the people of the   Thick Earth Sect or not,   He needed to completely conceal those more than a hundred acres of spirit fields and the cave mansion he had created so that he could be worry-free.   With this thought in mind, He Song immediately lost interest in continuing his seclusive cultivation.For ordinary attacks, he had the Earth Dragon Skill.   For trump card skills, he had the Thick Earth Seal and the Arrow God Thorn.   He had the high-quality offensive Artifact, the Black Tiger Seal.   He had the high-quality defensive Artifact, the Green Water Tortoise Shell Shield.   At the same time, he also had the Blood Escape Skill, a tunneling skill that could burst out with extreme speed at any time.   And countless other auxiliary skills.   With so many Foundation Establishment techniques, He Song’s combat power at this moment was probably outstanding among the Early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.   When facing Mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, even if he couldn’t beat them, He Song could leave at any time if he wanted to run.   And it was precisely because of this.   With his current strength vastly improved, He Song was no longer as restrained as before when leaving the Immortal Pavilion he was guarding to handle other matters.   As soon as he thought of it.   He Song moved his thoughts and manipulated a puppet to go to the entrance of his mansion.    Then, he left an instruction at the core of the puppet. The puppet would speak every hour interval.   “Master orders, come back next month.”   In this way, even if He Song had already left, the puppet would still say this sentence every hour interval under the instruction’s condition.   With this sentence, it could send Fang Yu, who reported once a month, away.   Even if Fang Yu had suspicions.   He would not dare to act rashly.   The power of a Foundation Establishment Master was not something a Qi Refining stage cultivator could bear.   After preparing to leave Herbs Immortal Workshop, He Song pondered for a moment and collected the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array from his mansion into his storage bag.   If he encountered enemies this time,   Having this Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array with him would provide him with an additional trump card.   With the Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array on him, He Song’s thoughts moved, and his entire body instantly tunneled underground, quietly heading towards the outside of the Herbs Immortal Workshop.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m   He traveled dozens of miles along the way.   Once he had completely left the Herbs Immortal Workshop,   He Song’s figure turned into a water-blue tunneling light, heading towards the original sphere of influence of the Thick Earth Sect.   His Herbs Immortal Workshop was tens of thousands of miles away from the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   Even for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, it would take more than ten days to travel by tunneling light or driving a spirit boat.   This was also the reason why He Song did not return to the Thick Earth Sect every year and harvest all his spirit fields and medicine gardens.   The duration was just too long.   He would rather cultivate new spirit fields and plant spirit medicines and spirit rice near the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   He was unwilling to travel such a long distance every year, wasting a month’s time going back and forth.   Maybe.   After he returned this time, it would be time for him to open spirit fields near   the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   On the way, he flew.   Time passed quickly.   In the blink of an eye, more than ten days passed.   During these ten days, He Song didn’t encounter any danger.   Even when he left the Herbs Immortal Workshop and became a tunneling light.    He spent the rest of the time driving a spirit boat.   But even then, despite the conspicuous nature of the spirit boat, He Song did not encounter any danger.   Reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, his safety level was naturally a notch higher than that of Qi Refining cultivators.   In the old days, He Song had only the ability of Qi Refining, so he could only use Earth Tunneling Skill when traveling.   But now, he had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm.   His strength had improved countless times compared to before.   In such a situation, even if He Song drove a spirit boat in the sky, his safety was guaranteed.   Moreover.   He Song’s own identity was the Elder of the Thick Earth Sect.   And the area he was in was within the Thick Earth Sect’s sphere of influence.   Under these circumstances, He Song’s safety was naturally further improved.   Nevertheless, He Song didn’t let his guard down.   Although his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation seemed to have surpassed many people, it was just the starting point of the Immortal Path in the world of cultivating immortality.   If he did not remain vigilant at all times, his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation would probably not be able to protect He Song.   Now, he was only more relaxed because he was within the scope of the Thick Earth Sect’s influence, so he chose to manipulate the spirit boat to travel quickly.   If it were in other dangerous places, He Song would probably still tunnel underground and travel beneath the ground as he did in the Qi Refining stage.   Although doing so would slow him down considerably.   But it was safer.   Now.   In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed.   He Song’s figure had finally returned to the vicinity of the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   Upon reaching the vicinity of the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate,   He Song did not enter the mountain gate.   Now that he had the responsibility of guarding the Herbs Immortal Workshop, he would quickly be questioned if he returned to the sect rashly.   Rather than exposing the fact that he was not guarding the Immortal   Workshop ,   It was better not to enter the mountain gate and finish all the tasks he had to do outside the gate, then quietly return to the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   Doing so would naturally not draw attention.   Passing the mountain gate.   He Song quickly followed the direction in his memory and headed towards the location of the spirit fields he had opened up.   Soon.   He Song used the Mountain Escaping Skill and hid his figure underground, going to the location of one of his created spirit fields..

Chapter 212 - 212: 206: Killing and Searching the Corpse (5000 Words Chapter) Translator: 549690339   It had already been four years since He Song left the Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   During the ten years he spent in the sect’s mountain gate, he would usually leave the sect once a year to harvest the spirit rice from these spirit fields. And replenish the spirit stones in the areas where the spirit fields were located.   Thus.   He Song hadn’t replenished their spirit stones for four years.   When He Song found this place and revealed his head from the dark, looking around with guarded eyes.     He discovered that the formations in the area had long since failed, and the spirit fields he had planted in the valley had been destroyed beyond recognition.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))   His eyes swept across the destroyed spirit fields before him.   He Song sighed in his heart.   As expected.   The formations recorded in the “Array Tao Introduction,” whether it’s the Miniature Spirit Gathering Array, Illusion Array, or Five Phases Array, all require a change of spirit stones every year.   Now, years later, the failure of the formations was within He Song’s expectations.   However… whether these spirit fields have been discovered by other people or the Thick Earth Sect is still an unknown variable.   Thinking of this, He Song retracted his gaze, and a flash of spirit light suddenly appeared in his eyes.   Qi Observing Skill!   Already having mastered the Qi Observing Skill, when He Song observed his surroundings again, he certainly would not use the Spirit Vision Skill commonly used by Qi-refining cultivators.   As a Foundation Establishment Realm Pupil Skill, the Qi Observing Skill can see more things and has greater penetrating power.   Seeing through some hidden things is as easy as pie.   He Song used the Qi Observing Skill to observe his surroundings, to see if there were any cultivators hiding in them.   If there were, he would capture that person and use the Soul Searching Skill to find out if there were more people who knew about this place.   If there was no one, he could clean up all the traces of the spirit fields and formation in this place without worry.            As long as he cleared away the traces, this place would have nothing to do with him.   His gaze swept around.   He Song didn’t see any other cultivators hiding.   He then submerged back into the ground, using divine sense scanning to confirm that there was no one hiding in the surroundings.   It was only after making sure again that there was no one hiding that He Song finally breathed a sigh of relief and appeared in the valley.   Since there was no one hiding.   It was time to clear away the traces here.   With a single thought, his mana surged, and He Song quickly erased all traces related to the spirit fields and formations in the valley.   After erasing the traces, he only needed to let time pass for half a month, and this place would be able to return to its original state.   By then, no one would be able to detect the original spirit fields and formations here.   After doing all this.   He Song’s figure quickly submerged into the ground again, heading towards another spirit field location.   Like this.   One place.   Two places.   Three places…   Perhaps it was because the spirit fields He Song opened up were mostly in remote areas.   As he traveled along the way, he didn’t find any traces of tampering with his spirit fields.   The destruction of the spirit fields was mostly due to the wild beasts without spiritual intelligence and the chain reaction caused by the scarce spirit Qi.   The spirit Qi becomes thin, the spirit rice withers and dies.   The wild beasts trample and the spirit fields are destroyed.   He Song needs only to erase all traces of the spirit fields, and he can rest assured without worries.   Along the way, he restored all the spirit fields he had once opened up to their original state.   Not until he arrived at the last location of the spirit fields.            Barely revealing an eye from the underground and looking at the valley where the spirit fields were, a hint of vigilance suddenly flashed in He Song’s eyes.   This place.   It was the largest spirit field He Song had opened up within the sphere of influence of the Thick Earth Sect.   The area covered thirty acres!   It was also the first spirit field He Song found after abandoning the one near the Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   This thirty-acre spirit field was opened by He Song in a valley.   However, with four years passing by and the formations dissipating.   When He Song came here again, he found that the valley had been devastated.   The spirit fields had been destroyed beyond recognition, and the formations He Song had set up here had long stopped functioning due to the lack of spirit stones.   In the valley.   There was still an aura hidden within.   Seeing this scene, He Song didn’t hesitate to sacrifice both the Black Tiger Seal and the Green Water Tortoise Shell Shield on his body, surrounding himself.   At the same time, he held several Foundation Establishment Realm Defense Spirit Amulets in his hand.   Having done all this, and feeling a strong sense of security enveloping him, He Song finally breathed a sigh of relief, his gaze once again turned towards the valley.   No incidents had occurred in the many spirit fields he had encountered before.   This led He Song to believe that his spirit fields were well concealed, and the chances of other cultivators discovering them were quite small.   As a result, he had let down his guard slightly.   Fortunately, He Song had not completely let his guard down.   He still came using Earth Tunneling, and during his first glimpse, he would only expose one eye subconsciously.   It was a good thing He Song had not completely let his guard down.   There was an aura hiding within the valley in front of him.   Although he didn’t know the cultivation level of this person yet.   But judging by the aura concealment, it didn’t look like someone with good intentions.   Perhaps this person was guarding this place, waiting silently for the fish to bite.   If he had come swaggering openly, he might have been ambushed by this person right away.   By the time of regret, it could already be too late.   He Song secretly muttered “dangerous” in his heart, settling his mind. A flash of spirit light quickly appeared in his eyes, and he looked towards the direction where the aura was hiding..

Chapter 213 - 213: 206: Killing and Touching the Corpse (5000 Words Big Chapter)_2 Translator: 549690339   With a single glance,   He Song retracted his gaze, his expression returning to its usual calmness.   “Ninth-tier Qi Refining?”   Feeling relieved, He Song thought for a moment, and then decided to scout the surroundings once again by using the Earth Tunneling technique.   After confirming that there were no other cultivators around,     He Song concealed his own aura and slowly tunneled underground, heading in the direction of the ninth-tier Qi Refining cultivator not far away.   Soon enough, He Song appeared behind this ninth-tier Qi Refining cultivator.   This individual was a young man, possessing a sturdy build, with a back like a tiger and a waist like a bear.   Just from the sight of his back alone, one could conclude that he was not ordinary.   If He Song was still in the Qi Refining stage, upon laying his sight on this cultivator, he would likely turn tail and run.   Typically, cultivators with muscular physiques, that carry a strong killing aura like this man, are body refining cultivators.   Body refining cultivators are significantly more formidable in combat than ordinary cultivators.   If they were both in the Qi Refining stage, He Song would certainly not engage in a head-on collision with such a body-refining loose cultivator.   But things are different now.   He Song, now, is a Foundation Establishment Master.   In front of a ninth-tier body-refining cultivator, He Song wouldn’t feel any psychological burden.   In the face of the suppression of the larger cultivation realm,   irrespective of your exceptional talent, your widespread reputation, your formidable strength, with a single strike, He Song could send this person to meet his maker.   However, when it comes to body refining, He Song had also thought of practicing it.            Moreover, he had already learned a Foundation Establishment Realm body refining skill from the Book Collection Pavilion of the Thick Earth Sect.   But due to time constraints, He Song hadn’t begun practicing this body refining skill and thus lacked a body as ferocious as the man in front of him.   His gaze skimmed over the man’s muscular frame that resembled a demonic beast, and He Song quietly extended his hand.   “Soul Searching Skill!”   As He Song’s hand touched the back of the man’s head, he immediately began employing the Soul Searching Skill.   The man, initially believing that he was perfectly concealed and preparing for a surprise attack, suddenly felt a sharp pain, his body convulsing. He opened his mouth wide, instinctively trying to scream out loud.   But before he could scream,   He Song, who already anticipated the scream, had drawn several small rocks using mana from the surroundings. As soon as the man opened his mouth, He Song promptly shoved them inside.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates   Next,   He Song didn’t forget to cover the man’s mouth with one hand, muffling the man’s screams to mere whimpering sounds.   Meanwhile,   Images started to flash before He Song’s eyes.   Skipping over most of the images, He Song quickly learned of this person’s name.   The man was called Wei Hong.   He wasn’t a disciple of a sect, nor was he a cultivator from the Immortal Pavilion. From the day he began to draw Qi into his body, he had always been a loose cultivator.   Usually, he hunted demonic beasts for spirit stones and used various devious methods, even murder and robbery to accumulate spirit stones. Only then was he able to successfully advance to the late stage of Qi Refining.   More than two years ago, when he was passing by this place, he stumbled upon something unusual in the valley. The thirty-acre spirit field, the withered spirit rice in the field, and that barely-functioning array.   All these things drew his attention.   Seeing as this place appeared to have been abandoned for a long time, his courage gradually grew.   After waiting for several months, he hurried into the valley as soon as the array deactivated, harvesting all the spirit rice that was still edible.   Aside from the majority of spirit rice that had lost its spirit Qi and was no longer consumable, although he only gathered a small portion of the remaining spirit rice, he ended up with ten thousand kilograms of spirit rice.   Ten thousand kilograms of spirit rice!   That’s a total of one thousand spirit stones!            For a loose cultivator like him, upon obtaining spirit stones, he would definitely quickly convert them into his own strength.   Buying artifacts, elixirs, spirit amulets, and so on, all require a lot of spirit stones.   One thousand spirit stones, for ordinary loose cultivators, can be considered a hefty fortune.   As a result of this,   A hint of greed grew in his heart.   If he could harvest all of the rice from this thirty-acre spirit field, how much would he get?   Three thousand spirit stones!   If he could have these three thousand spirit stones every year….   Indulging in such fantasies, he decided to hide in the dark and wait for the master of this place to return.   According to his plan,   If the master of this place was of a low cultivation level, he might gain a cornucopia!   And if the master was of a high cultivation level, he could quietly retreat.   Risking little to win big, a perfect plan.   So he hid himself here, making plans to act once He Song arrived.   During this time, thankfully, no other cultivators discovered this unusual place.   Until He Song’s arrival today.   But what Wei Hong didn’t expect,   was that the master of this place, He Song, was a Foundation Establishment Master.   And this Foundation Establishment Master was extremely cautious.   Before Wei Hong could even detect He Song, He Song had already noticed him.   Moreover, He Song gave Wei Hong no chance to make excuses, instead, hit him directly with the Soul Searching Skill.   Next,   All of Wei Hong’s possessions and the ten thousand kilograms of spirit rice he had harvested previously, were now in He Song’s hands.   After looking through Wei Hong’s memories and discovering that Wei Hong was just an ordinary loose cultivator with not much wealth, He Song quickly shook his head and stopped using the Soul Searching Skill.   Just as He Song stopped using the Soul Searching Skill on Wei Hong,   Wei Hong’s physique, which was like a tiger and a bear, collapsed onto the ground as he broke into giggles like a child..        

Chapter 214 - 214: 206: Killing and Touching the Corpse (5000 -word Big Chapter)_3 Translator: 549690339   Having seen this situation before, He Song was already used to it.   He didn’t even want to appreciate the sight of Wei Hong’s soul being injured, turned into a fool.   He simply stretched out his hand and pointed.   A huge fireball swallowed Wei Hong in front of him.   In just an instant, a powerful Loose cultivator at the Qi-refining late stage was killed by He Song.     At the same time.   He Song sighed in his heart.   “The Qi Refining stage is, after all, just the Qi Refining stage. When facing a Master in the Foundation Establishment Realm, no matter how strong one’s strength is at the same level, one is nothing more than a large ant,” “Improving one’s realm is more important than anything.”   After the sigh.   He Song casually collected the ashes left by Wei Hong after death into his storage bag.   Then he reached out and grabbed.   Wei Hong’s storage bag fell into He Song’s hands.   The wealth of a Loose cultivator at the Qi-refining late stage was probably around one or two thousand spirit stones.   Wei Hong was slightly wealthier, with a fortune of two or three thousand spirit stones.   However, the ten thousand catties of spirit rice he had obtained from the spirit field here accounted for about one thousand spirit stones.   So in the end, Wei Hong’s wealth was just average for a Loose cultivator at the Qi-refining late stage.   After putting all the valuable things in Wei Hong’s storage bag into his own, He Song casually put the inferior storage bag in his sleeve.   The inferior storage bag was worth only one hundred spirit stones, but He Song didn’t mind the small value.   He killed someone.   And looted the corpse.   After cleaning up the scene, He Song quickly started working on this spirit field, which was as large as thirty acres.   After some time, He Song completely erased all traces in the valley related to the spirit field and Array Skills.   Next, all that was needed was to wait for various plants to grow and completely change the scenery to be the same as the surroundings.   At that time.   The one hundred acres of spirit field that He Song had opened up within the range of the Thick Earth Sect’s influence would be completely gone forever.   No one would ever be able to trace it back to He Song again   After restoring the entire one hundred acres of spirit field back to the appearance of a forest.   He Song went back to the cave mansion he had opened up for Foundation Establishment.   After four years.    When He Song returned to this temporary cave mansion he had opened up for Foundation Establishment.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎   He Song looked around and a hint of nostalgia flashed in his eyes.   He had secluded himself here for several years.   If it weren’t for the need to establish his foundation before he turned sixty, he might have continued to stay here.   Unfortunately, there is no “what if”.   Now, he has been transferred by Master Fa Xuan to guard another Immortal Pavilion.   This cave mansion is probably going to become desolate again just like before he came here, right?   With a sigh in his heart.   He Song then stepped into the range of the Smoke Array.   Quickly, his figure disappeared into the air.   Inside the Smoke Array.   He Song’s figure quietly emerged.   As soon as He Song entered the Smoke Array,   He quickly entered the cave mansion he had opened up.   Upon entering the cave mansion,   He Song looked inside.   But as his eyes swept over, he found that the scene in the cave mansion was no different from when he left.   It was just that there was more dust inside because He Song hadn’t been back   lor a long urne.   Seeing this, He Song waved his hand casually.   A gentle breeze swept through.   The dust in the cave mansion was suddenly blown away and swirled to a distance.   After the cave mansion became clean again, He Song extended his divine sense and enveloped the entire cave mansion. As soon as he probed, He Song was shocked.   Little turtle.   Gone!   But no corpse was found.   The scene of him throwing the little turtle by the river flashed through his mind.   Subconsciously, He Song expanded his divine sense, instantly searching towards the river.   He wanted to look for the little turtle there.   He Song didn’t search for long.   Soon.   He found the figure of a little turtle by the river.    However, by now.   After several years of growth, the little turtle, which was only the size of a plate when He Song left, had grown much larger, in fact, it was a full circle larger than a plate.   It’s not dead.   That’s good.   Relieved, He Song moved his divine sense, and immediately brought the little turtle, who had been sunbathing by the river, back into the cave mansion.   Four years had passed, the little turtle had grown a bit, but its spirit power was still weak.   According to He Song’s estimation, it should still be at the Qi Refining Early   Stage.   But He Song didn’t care much.   He kept this turtle to guard his home, and occasionally entertain him.   As for fighting?   It didn’t seem to have anything to do with a turtle.   The little turtle’s whole body was pure white, its shell and skin all looked like they were made of carved white jade, giving it a crystal-clear appearance.   It was quite similar to the egg from before.   A body larger than a plate by one circle made it look quite impressive.   He Song held it in his hand and carefully examined it. Then, he quickly took out a Beast Mastery Token from his storage bag.   He had bought the Beast Mastery Token from the Herbs Immortal Workshop.   At that time, when he accompanied Ping’er and Chu Shuangshuang to wander around the Herbs Immortal Workshop, he casually bought a Beast Mastery Token, prepared to give it to the little turtle in the future.   Now.   The little turtle has survived four years.   It’s time to use it.   He Song placed the Beast Mastery Token on the little turtle’s forehead.   As He Song cast his spells.   Originally, the little turtle had been somewhat resistant due to the presence of the Beast Mastery Token on its forehead, but it quickly stopped resisting.   As time passed.   When the little turtle’s soul imprint was fully engraved on the Beast Mastery   Token, it meant that the little turtle had become a spirit beast in the eyes of cultivators.   A spirit beast is a demonic beast with a master.   As a spirit beast.   As long as He Song controls the Beast Mastery Token, he can command the little turtle and even control its life and death.   Spirit beasts are undoubtedly a great aid for cultivators.   For example, some cultivators who excel in Beast Taming can control spirit beasts to fight for them, which is similar to He Song’s creation of puppets to assist himself.   After turning the little turtle into his own spirit beast.   He Song casually flipped it over with its belly facing up.   He looked at it for a moment, then nodded his head as he said,   “Your skin is like creamy jade, so clear and pure white. From now on, you’ll be called Yu’er..”

Chapter 215 - 215: 207: Encountering an Old Friend (3000 Words Major Chapter) Translator: 549690339   He named Yu’er.   Yu’er seemed a bit confused, not knowing whether she understood or not.     But He Song didn’t mind.   After naming her, he casually tossed her aside and shifted his gaze toward the outside of the cave mansion.   Outside the cave mansion.   There were dozens of acres of spirit fields, as well as some medicine gardens, waiting for him to harvest.   After four years, thanks to the existence of two small spirit-gathering arrays with abundant spirit stones, the concentration of spirit Qi in He Song’s cave mansion was fairly high.   One might even say it was very dense.   In such circumstances, whether it was the spirit fields He Song had cultivated on the flat ground.   Or the medicinal garden he had established on the small hill, the spirit rice and spirit medicine growing within were all sufficiently nourished by the rich spirit Qi.   Moreover, it had been four years since He Song had harvested the spirit rice and spirit medicine from this place.   Therefore.   When He Song came to the spirit rice field, ready to harvest the spirit rice that had been planted for four years.     As soon as he arrived, he noticed something unusual.   The spirit rice planted here, which hadn’t been harvested for a full four years, seemed different from the spirit rice he had harvested before.   Having not been harvested for four years.   The spirit rice here had been continuously absorbing dense spirit Qi.   Under the nourishment of this dense spirit Qi.   The rice grains on the spirit rice had undergone subtle changes.   They were larger than ordinary spirit rice, and they contained even more spirit   By appearance, they looked far better than ordinary spirit rice.   Seeing this.   He Song was surprised, but he soon seemed to realize something, and a flash of understanding crossed his mind.   Spirit rice.   During the Qi Refining stage, it could increase the cultivation speed of cultivators.   This increase in cultivation speed was at its best during the Qi Refining stage.   By the time of the Foundation Establishment Realm, when He Song ate spirit rice, there was only a minimal increase in his mana.   Put simply.   Having reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, although He Song still had a constant supply of spirit rice daily, the improvement effect the spirit rice brought to his cultivation was much less than it had been during the Qi Refining stage.   While there was still an increase.   Compared with the Qi Refining stage, it was much less.   Though that’s the case, in the absence of other substitutes, the majority of Foundation Establishment Masters would continue consuming spirit rice.   Though the increase in cultivation was small, cultivation was accumulated bit by bit, and no one would think it was too much.   This was why the price of spirit rice remained stable.   A large number of Qi Refining stage cultivators consumed spirit rice, and many cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm did the same.   Under such vast consumption.   The cultivation of spirit rice in the Immortal Pavilions, Immortal Cities, and Sects was naturally not small.   Basically, they were all able to maintain a slight surplus in the output of spirit rice.   The production of spirit rice required consumption of spirit Qi, and the total amount of spirit Qi remained basically constant.   If spirit rice is produced crazily.   Then the Spirit Qi supplied to cultivators in the Sects, Immortal Pavilions, and Immortal Cities would naturally be reduced.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m   This was why the sects and aristocratic families that occupy a certain territory wouldn’t produce spirit rice crazily.   Spirit rice.   Just enough is sufficient.   Having too much would affect the cultivators’ cultivation.   The losses would outweigh the gains.    However, He Song, who was in the Thick Earth Sect, had heard some rumors.   According to the rumors.   Above normal spirit rice.   There were even more precious spirit rice varieties that could speed up the cultivation of those at the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Originally, He Song didn’t pay much attention to this.   Because his cultivation was primarily based on elixirs, the dense spirit Qi from small spirit-gathering arrays, and some other auxiliary methods that could improve cultivation.   As for the spirit rice, it actually only accounted for a small portion.   Until today.   When He Song looked at the spirit rice in front of him, which hadn’t been harvested for four years and already contained more spirit Qi than ordinary spirit rice, he suddenly realized something. The rumors he heard before weren’t just rumors.   They were truly existing.   If there were rumors, there must be a method to cultivate them.   If he were to cultivate this kind of spirit rice, which can speed up the cultivation of those at the Foundation Establishment Realm, in the future.   Then wouldn’t he have a more efficient method of earning spirit stones than ordinary spirit rice?   With such a thought crossing his mind.   After thinking, He Song quickly decided that he may need to return to the sect this time.   He needed to go to the sect’s Book Collection Pavilion to see if there were any cultivation methods for this kind of spirit rice.   Even if he couldn’t find it.   Perhaps he could find some methods to cultivate other spirit plants.   With the methods to cultivate other spirit plants, he might be able to earn spirit stones by cultivating other spirit plants or spirit medicines.   Rather than having to work hard and trouble himself to sell them in various Immortal Pavilions after harvesting the spirit rice, as he did before.   After thinking of this, He Song quickly started to harvest the spirit rice in front of him, which was already quite different from the ordinary spirit rice, and put all the spirit rice into his storage bag.   After harvesting the spirit rice.   He Song went up to the small hill and harvested all the spirit medicines grown in the medicine garden on the hill.   After completing these two tasks.   He Song once again looked around, and soon began to dismantle the spirit fields and medicine garden he had previously created.   Since this cave mansion was going to be abandoned.   Before removing the array, it was necessary to restore this place to its original state.   Foundation Establishment cultivators have great physical abilities.   They can manipulate their mana to quickly envelop a large area around them.   Therefore,   He Song quickly dealt with all the traces within the Smoke Array.   In a very short time, He Song managed to take care of dozens of acres of spirit fields and several Medicine Gardens.   He even blocked off the cave mansion he had set up for seclusive cultivation.   After doing all this,   He Song did not dismantle the Smoke Array, he merely removed the two small Spirit-Gathering Arrays in the cave mansion.   He had other matters to attend to on this return.   Once everything else was taken care of, he could come back and take Yu’er away.   It would draw too much attention if he disbanded the Smoke Array at this location and carried Yu’er around with him.   After erasing all traces related to the spirit fields, Medicine Gardens, and Array   Skills within the Smoke Array,   He Song casually threw Yu’er by the riverside.   He quickly sank into the ground and headed towards the not-too-distant Green Wall Immortal City.   Green Wall Immortal City, was the nearest Immortal City from here.   He needed to go there to purchase some necessary items for puppet making.   Tens of miles outside the Green Wall Immortal City,   He Song’s figure emerged from the ground.   Concealment Skill, restricting his own breath to the ninth-tier Qi Refining.   Then, he started the Mountain Wind Riding Skill earnestly and shot towards the direction of the Green Wall Immortal City.   Once again arriving at the Green Wall Immortal City.   As He Song stepped into it, a trace of vicissitude flashed across his eyes.    He still remembered when,   His foundation was still in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, his cultivation level was at the Qi-refining mid-stage when Wei Fan wanted to invite him to the Green Wall Immortal City for gaining more experience.   At that time, he politely declined for his own safety.   Later, until his cultivation level broke through to the seventh-tier Qi Refining.   Only when Meng Guan summoned him, did he come together with Wei Fan from Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to the Green Wall Immortal City.   That was the first time he entered an Immortal City.   His impression of Green Wall Immortal City was extremely profound.   It was also from that time onwards,   He,   Wei Fan,   Their fates changed drastically.   He Song originally thought that he would only have one chance to reach the Foundation Establishment stage before the age of sixty, like other cultivators with four spirits roots.   But who would have expected that after Meng Guan successfully reached the Foundation Establishment, he directly took him and Wei Fan into the Thick Earth Sect and became disciples of the Thick Earth Sect.   Although He Song could have successfully reached the Foundation   Establishment without joining the Thick Earth Sect or having the Foundation   Establishment Elixir ,   But because he joined the Thick Earth Sect ahead of time and obtained enough Foundation Establishment Elixirs, as well as insights for Foundation Establishment.   He completed the Foundation Establishment faster than he had originally planned.   Under such circumstances,   His first visit to the Green Wall Immortal City did indeed change his destiny.   But now,   As he once again set foot in the Green Wall Immortal City,   He found that everything here had already changed beyond recognition.   Perhaps within the Green Wall Immortal City, there is no one who recognizes him anymore?   A trace of vicissitudes flashed in his eyes, as He Song pressed on without a change in his expression.   He needs to find the precious materials needed for his puppet making.   Presumably,   Those materials can be found within the Immortal City.   However, as He Song moved forward to purchase the materials he needed,   His gaze swept across the surroundings, and his body suddenly stopped in its tracks.   Not far away,   A young girl was staring at He Song with a stunned expression on her face.   Only when He Song noticed her and their eyes met, did the girl’s expression change from shock to joy.   “Song?”   As the familiar voice echoed in his ears, a trace of blankness flashed in He Song’s eyes.   In that moment,   The image of the young girl in front of He Song seemed to overlap with the image of a little girl from many years ago.   Then, from the figure of the little girl into the radiant and beautiful young girl of today.   “Su Yan?”   He lightly called out the name of the girl in front of him, but he was also reminded of a conversation he had with Su Yan many years ago.   Back then, He Song learned from Zhao Lin’s message that Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion was likely to be attacked.   Zhao Lin had even specially informed He Song at that time that if he was concerned about Su Yan’s safety, he needed to be prepared to go to Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion to take Su Yan away.   But at that time, He Song had no such plans.   At that time, He Song merely informed Su Yan about it, and then put the matter out of his mind.   But who would have expected-   Su Yan, who had taken his advice and left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion, had actually come to the Green Wall Immortal City.   And today, after so many years, she appeared in front of him again.   Looking at Su Yan, whose appearance and aura hadn’t changed in the slightest, but whose cultivation had changed from mid-stage Qi Refining to ninth-tier Qi Refining, He Song felt as if time had flown by.   The Su Yan in front of him seemed to have returned to being the little girl from back then.   However, very soon,   The look in He Song’s eyes became calm again.   Although today’s Su Yan is still the same person as the Su Yan of the past, The relationship between the two of them has gradually changed. If before, the relationship between Su Yan and He Song was purely that of neighbors,   Then now….

Chapter 216 - 216: 208: Treasure Pavilion (3000 words) Translator: 549690339   So now, Su Yan.   Perhaps her feelings towards him were no longer as pure as before when they met again.     Neither He Song.   Nor su Yan.   After so many years, their mentality and status had changed completely from the past.   “Song, is it really you? I thought I was mistaken.”   Hearing He Song call her name, Su Yan’s face lit up with joy, and she immediately ran to He Song’s side, staring at him.   It seemed as if she wanted to see how He Song had changed after all these years.   “You’re not mistaken, but it’s rather noisy here. Let’s go to the teahouse for a chat.”   Waving his hand, He Song looked around.   He soon saw a teahouse.   He gestured for Su Yan to follow him and casually replied.   He Song had just entered the city and hadn’t had the chance to buy the various items he needed.     So, it was a good opportunity to catch up with Su Yan, whom he hadn’t seen for a long time.   At the side.   Seeing He Song heading to the teahouse and gesturing for her to follow, Su Yan’s face flashed a smile, and she quickly followed suit.   In the teahouse.   He Song casually ordered a private room, and he and Su Yan entered the room one after another.   When the tea was served on the table,   The two quickly began discussing their experiences over the years.   When they talked about how He Song specifically sent her a message a few years ago, telling her to flee Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   There was a hint of lingering fear on Su Yan’s face.   “After you left Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion last time, did you come here?”   Looking at Su Yan in front of him, He Song casually asked about her recent situation.   He hadn’t learned much about Su Yan over the years.   He had just broken through the Foundation Establishment Realm and was trying to improve his combat prowess; he didn’t have any spare time to deal with these minor things.   Moreover, Su Yan didn’t tell him about these things.   So, he wasn’t particularly informed about her recent situation.   “Yes, thanks to Song’s warning back then, otherwise, I might have died in that catastrophe.”   “I’m grateful to Song.”   Facing He Song’s question, Su Yan answered and even made a proper bow to He Song to show her gratitude.   Had it not been for He Song’s message,   She might have died in Bamboo Mountain Immortal Pavilion.   Naturally, she would express her gratitude to He Song again upon meeting him now.   “By the way, Song, you must have something to do in the city this time. Can you tell me?”   “I’m very familiar with Green Wall Immortal City now, and I can help you with whatever you want to do.”   It seemed as if a verbal thank you was too bland, so Su Yan decided to show her gratitude through practical actions after thinking about it.   On this matter,   He Song considered,   And his heart was moved a little at that.   He knew the city of Green Wall, but he didn’t know which shops sold the materials he needed for puppet making.   In that case, it’s better for Su Yan to tell him where these valuable materials are sold, so he wouldn’t have to go to each shop and inquire.   With that thought,   He Song agreed.   “Then, I’ll thank you, Yan. This time, I need to buy some materials.” “Here’s the list of materials; you can see which shops in the city can supply them.”    He Song didn’t forget to take out a piece of thin paper from his storage bag while he spoke.   He infused his mana into his fingertip, and soon several lines of material names that were needed for the Puppet Refining Skill were left on the thin paper.   “Green Spirit Water, Dark God Crystal, Ink Copper, Black True Silk…” Dense material names were engraved on the thin paper by He Song.   He handed the paper to Su Yan, and a mysterious light flashed in his eyes.   There was no concealment of the materials on the paper.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com   The materials needed for making a Foundation Establishment Realm puppet were quite valuable.   Even if Su Yan remembered these materials, she would not be able to replicate He Song’s actions in buying these materials and refining them into puppets.   Without the Spirit Puppet Skill, these materials were just materials.   Even if other puppet techniques were used, these materials wouldn’t amount to much.   Thus, it was better for Su Yan, who had lived in Green Wall Immortal City for a long time and knew the city like the back of her hand, to take a look at the materials.   Perhaps she could save him some time and point him in the right direction.   Of course,   Su Yan could only guide the way.   The next purchase stage had to be done by He Song himself.   If He Song really let Su Yan make the purchase, she might bring death upon herself.   Although He Song would definitely choose to follow her at the time,   But what would happen to the ninth-tier Qi Refining Su Yan after He Song left? He Song didn’t even need to think about how miserable Su Yan would be by then.   Therefore, He Song wouldn’t push Su Yan into the fire pit.   Even if it were a stranger he didn’t know, he wouldn’t let them suffer these consequences.   There was no need for it.   And it was too cruel. After receiving the paper from He Song,   Su Yan looked down.   She was quickly attracted by the various materials listed on the paper.   After a long time,   When she had looked over all the materials listed on the paper, Su Yan looked up at He Song.   “Many of these materials are unfamiliar to me, so they should be quite precious. If Song wants to find them, you can go to the Treasure Pavilion in the city.”   “There are branches of the Treasure Pavilion in every major Immortal City, and it should be able to meet Song’s requirements.”   “Even if the Treasure Pavilion here doesn’t have the items, they can be transferred from other branches, and they should be able to find them quickly.”   “As for other shops, I don’t think they have these things, so Song doesn’t need to waste his time.”   Returning the paper to He Song, Su Yan’s cheeks reddened slightly, feeling as if she hadn’t been able to help at all, and a trace of disappointment filled her heart.   However, she didn’t know.   With her words, He Song had already managed to avoid many detours.   As for the Treasure Pavilion, He Song had naturally heard of it before.   At the auction held by the Treasure Pavilion every three years, Foundation Establishment Elixirs would occasionally appear.   Although the timing of this “occasionally” was a bit uncertain, sometimes it was a decade or two apart, and sometimes it was several decades apart.   But it gave the loose cultivators some hope.   As a result, the reputation of the Treasure Pavilion spread far and wide, and countless cultivators came to know of it.   He Song had simply forgotten about it because he had never been to the Treasure Pavilion before.   Remembering it now saved him a lot of trouble. “Thank you, Yan’er.”   After thanking Su Yan, He Song nodded to her.   He then took out a few bottles of Qi Condensing Elixirs for improving one’s cultivation in the late stage of Qi Refining from his storage bag.   These elixirs were worth hundreds of spirit stones.   They would serve as a thank-you gift for Su Yan’s help this time.   For Su Yan, this gift was something she could keep and the best present He Song could give her.   If the gift was too valuable,   With her ninth-tier Qi Refining strength, she might not be able to keep it,   And it might even bring about her death.   After presenting these elixirs as his thank-you gift,   He Song took his leave.    For the matters to come,   Su Yan could no longer be involved, and He Song didn’t want to involve her either.   It was better for both parties to say goodbye.   He Song left alone-   And quickly went to an inn where, after spending ten spirit stones to rent a room for ten days,   He changed his appearance and used the Breath Concealment Skill to disguise his cultivation as Qi Refining great perfection.   Then, clad in a black robe, he left the inn.   With his changed appearance, He Song believed that no one in Green Wall Immortal City could recognize him anymore.   Thus, he confidently headed straight to the Treasure Pavilion.   As He Song revealed himself to be at the level of Qi Refining great perfection, after entering the Treasure Pavilion, he was quickly ushered into the VIP room.   Inside the VIP room-   “I am Jiang Fei, may I know your honorable name, my friend?”   After leading He Song into the VIP room, Jiang Fei, a cultivator at the ninth-tier of Qi Refining with a fortune-filled face, immediately asked.   In his view, He Song’s current cultivation of Qi Refining great perfection might make him a big spender.   Naturally, his attitude towards He Song was quite good.   “I am the loose cultivator Chen Zhou. I came here to purchase some materials; please have a look.”   Faced with Jiang Fei’s inquiry, He Song casually mentioned Chen Zhou’s name.   Chen Zhou-   He had been killed by Wei Fan on He Song’s request decades ago.   Using this person’s name, He Song didn’t have to worry about his identity being discovered by others, nor did he have to worry about them investigating Chen Zhou.   What could one investigate about a person who had been dead for decades?   As he reported his name, He Song handed the paper in his hand to Jiang Fei.   The materials on the paper had not been deliberately added or subtracted by He Song.   They were the same as before when he showed them to Su Yan, without any modification.   Although these materials were precious, they were all for refining puppets.   Jiang Fei or the Treasure Pavilion, even if they knew He Song was buying these materials to refine puppets, would not have any intentions towards these materials.   Just like cooking-   You buy some ribs to take home.   Who knows if you bought the ribs to make sweet and sour ribs, stewed ribs, braised ribs or rib soup?   Without the Spirit Puppet Skill, even if Jiang Fei or the Treasure Pavilion had the same materials, they couldn’t refine spirit puppets.   He Song was not worried about this at all.   Instead of worrying about this, it’s better to let himself make fewer trips and finish collecting the materials here.   As a result-   Seeing the paper handed over by He Song, Jiang Fei quickly began to quote prices.   For a Foundation Establishment Realm spirit puppet-   The required materials, apart from some less valuable ones used for internal purposes, were needed for extremely tough and solid materials to be used in areas such as attack weapons and body defense.   These materials, which were at least capable of withstanding attacks at the Foundation Establishment Realm level or posing a threat to a Foundation Establishment Master, were naturally expensive.   As Jiang Fei quoted prices one after another,   The number of spirit stones in He Song’s storage bag gradually decreased.   However, fortunately, He Song had a large number of spirit stones, and he still had more than 100,000 left after his continuous accumulation and consumption.   Although he had used many spirit stones over the years,   before he left the Thick Earth Sect, he was able to harvest more than 10,000 or nearly 20,000 spirit stones per year.   Under such circumstances, He Song had spent a full ten years within the Thick Earth Sect.   Plus the remaining spirit stones, if all had been saved, He Song would probably have more than 200,000.   He had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in these years, and his consumption had been huge.   As a result, he only had a little over 100,000 spirit stones left in savings.   However, even so-   More than 100,000 spirit stones were enough to support his current spending.   The materials for making spirit puppets were indeed precious, but the spirit puppets He Song wanted to make were not large, only ordinary human-sized ones, not exotic spirit puppets.   The spirit stones spent on these materials were not particularly terrifying-   With just under 20,000 spirit stones, He Song had bought enough materials to make a spirit puppet.   Nevertheless-   He Song did not stop buying them..

Chapter 217 - 217: 209: Heaven Ascending Inn He Song spent tens of thousands of spirit stones, buying more materials for making spirit puppets.   Refining spirit puppets was not always successful.   Materials for making spirit puppets naturally could not be prepared in just one portion.     Since he happened to be here, he purchased more to avoid any failure in refining and having to leave the Immortal Pavilion to buy materials again.   That would be too troublesome.   It is better to buy more at once, and begin refining spirit puppets after returning to the Immortal Pavilion.   He prepared several portions of puppet refining materials, costing tens of thousands of spirit stones.   After some consideration, He Song also purchased some defense spirit amulets and life-saving spirit amulets for Foundation Establishment Realm usage at the Treasure Pavilion.   Defensive spirit amulets for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators were much more expensive than those for Qi Refining stage cultivators.   The defense spirit amulets and life-saving spirit amulets he purchased cost him several thousand spirit stones in total.   Such a terrifying expenditure made He Song secretly click his tongue.   However, as an amulet Tao master, he also understood the difficulties of Amulet Tao.   Foundation Establishment spirit amulets were so expensive, their cost should not be too low either.   As for the exact cost, He Song probably could only find out after becoming a Foundation Establishment amulet master and drawing one himself.     Right now, He Song’s research on Amulet Tao was far from being able to create Foundation Establishment spirit amulets.   It wasn’t difficult for He Song to make rapid progress in Amulet Tao. After Foundation Establishment,   Learning the Qi Observing Skill would greatly reduce the difficulty in understanding and mastering the method of drawing spirit amulets.   The Qi Observing Skill was extremely useful for various Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth.   It was precisely because of this,   that after Foundation Establishment masters learned the Qi Observing Skill, they only needed to study a little more, they could completely master the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Introduction that required no talent, only hard work.   However, that’s about it.   As for the Array Tao Primary Introduction and Amulet Tao Introductory Insights, learning the Qi Observing Skill would only slightly reduce the difficulty of studying them.   There was still a huge difference between the introductory and primary stages.   It was like the gap between the Qi Refining stage and the Foundation Establishment Realm.   It was an unbridgeable chasm.   He Song mastering the small Spirit-Gathering Array, Smoke Array, and Seven Kills Heaven Fire Array from the Array Tao Primary Introduction was because he had some talent in Array Tao.   In addition, his powerful soul made his study of the Hundred Skills of Cultivation Truth much faster than ordinary cultivators.   With these two factors working together, He Song’s study of Array Tao Primary Introduction was so smooth.   After spending several thousand spirit stones purchasing some defense spirit amulets and life-saving spirit amulets for the Foundation Establishment   Realm,   He Song left under the puzzled eyes of Jiang Fei. After He Song’s figure exited the Treasure Pavilion,   Jiang Fei’s eyes suddenly flashed with a trace of doubt.   “Why would a Qi Refining great perfection cultivator buy Foundation   Establishment realm spirit amulets?”   “Could it be for his master’s use?”   “The materials he bought earlier also seemed to be for Foundation   Establishment realm cultivators.” “Hiss, could he be a disciple of a Master?”   “Or could it be…   Watching He Song’s receding figure, Jiang Fei carefully pondered for a moment, and felt that there was nothing improper in his dealings with He Song.   Only then did Jiang Fei let out a sigh of relief, a trace of fear crossing his face.   “Fortunately, I didn’t say anything offensive to him.” “Otherwise, I might have caused big trouble.”   Feeling relieved, a smile appeared on Jiang Fei’s face.   It seemed as if he was reminding himself to always greet every guest with a smile.   He Song didn’t pay any attention to Jiang Fei’s behavior behind him.   After purchasing several portions of puppet refining materials and Foundation Establishment realm spirit amulets, He Song left the Treasure Pavilion.            He found another inn nearby.   He planned to change his costume and leave Green Wall Immortal City.   However,   Just as He Song casually entered an inn and took out ten spirit stones to rent a room for ten days,   The innkeeper in front of him smiled and said,   “This is the Heaven Ascending Inn, the room fee is ten spirit stones per day.”   Although he didn’t explicitly refuse,   From the innkeeper’s smiling face, He Song knew that the keeper in front of him was probably eyeing the money.   All other inns only charged one spirit stone per day,   But here, he needed ten spirit stones per day?   And also called it Heaven Ascending Inn?   What? Did staying here for a night guarantee ascension to immortality?   Although He Song had a lot of spirit stones, even after a round of consumption, he still had more than 100,000 spirit stones left.   But he wouldn’t waste them like this.   He would save when he needed to and spend when necessary.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience   For his own strength, He Song could easily spend tens or even hundreds of thousands of spirit stones without blinking an eye.   But in a situation like this, he didn’t want to give even one extra spirit stone.   “There’s no need for that. The Heaven Ascending Inn had an Foundation Establishment Master ascending here more than ten years ago. That master ascended successfully here.”   “So, the name of our inn was changed to Heaven Ascending Inn.”   “With such a predecessor’s example, staying here during your breakthrough to Foundation Establishment might increase your success rate.”   “A room fee of ten spirit stones per night is really not expensive. If it was a few years ago, you would have to queue up to book a room.”   Seeing that He Song was about to turn around and leave, the innkeeper quickly explained.   As he spoke, he even puffed out his chest as if feeling proud that the name Heaven Ascending Inn had given him some sort of glory.   Heaven Ascending Inn had given him some sort of glory.   However,   As He Song listened to the innkeeper’s explanation,   He felt that something was wrong the more he listened.   More than ten years ago?   Successfully ascended here?   What is this… Why does it sound so much like me?   Looking around, disbelief flashed in He Song’s eyes.   This inn seems to be the one where he had “established his foundation” all those years ago.   Although the decorations of this inn had changed, the overall layout had only undergone minor alterations.   It was merely because He Song had casually chosen an inn to change his appearance before leaving Green Wall Immortal City that he had paid no attention to the surrounding environment.   He also hadn’t taken a close look at this inn.   Otherwise, he might have recognized it even before entering the inn.   This inn.   Indeed, it was the same one where he had “established his foundation” more than a decade ago.   How could he have expected it?   He had merely randomly chosen an inn for his “Foundation Establishment,” and after the breakthrough, the inn had astonishingly changed its name to Heaven Ascending Inn.   Now.   More than a decade later.   Not only was this Heaven Ascending Inn still in existence.   But it also charged a high price for him, the one who had started it all.   With this thought, He Song’s gaze towards the shopkeeper suddenly became weirder.   Then.   He didn’t say anything else.   Instead, he took out a hundred spirit stones and placed them lightly on the table.            “Get me a room for ten days.”   Just as He Song handed over the spirit stones.   He felt as if everything before his eyes was somewhat unreal. He.   Had unexpectedly become a legend in people’s mouths because of an unintentional small act.   Would the legend of Heaven Ascending Inn’s ascension persist in Green Wall Immortal City for a very long time?   However, nobody probably knew that the person who had left the legend behind.   When he once again returned to this place by sheer coincidence, he had to pay ten times the amount of spirit stones due to the legend he had once left behind. At this thought, He Song couldn’t help but have a strange expression on his face.   He looked at the shopkeeper with a touch of sigh in his eyes.   This shopkeeper.   Really was a clever person.   “Alright, Master, please come in.”   Seeing He Song show a hundred spirit stones, the shopkeeper immediately grinned and quickly invited He Song to check into the inn.   seemg tn1S scene.   He Song didn’t say anything more.   He just glanced around, matching the inn’s furnishings to what he had seen more than a decade ago when he had established his foundation.   Indeed, aside from some small details, everything matched.   He Song even heard the price of the room he had once stayed in from the shopkeeper.   “You’re asking about this room? This room was where the Master broke through and established his foundation. The price isn’t expensive; for a hundred spirit stones, I’ll arrange it for you for one night.” His randomly chosen room from back then.   Now it required a hundred spirit stones per night.   He Song couldn’t help but be rendered speechless at this.   He waved his hand to decline the shopkeeper’s invitation before quickly entering his newly-opened room.   He closed the door.   Turned on the Array Skills.   He concealed his aura completely.   Afterward.   He Song shook his head, took off his black robe, and burned it.   He then removed all the other items on his person, washing them and his body with mana.   Finally, he took out another black robe from his storage bag and put it on.   He then put all the items he had taken off back into his black robe.   After completing all this.   With a thought, He Song’s appearance changed drastically compared to before.   When his appearance had become completely unrecognizable, incapable of being recognized or tracked by anyone.   He Song left the inn and headed towards the distance.   However.   After leaving the inn, He Song couldn’t help but look back at the name of the inn once more.   “Heaven Ascending Inn.”   “Indeed, Heaven Ascending Inn.”   “Who could have thought that a casual choice could create a legend here?”   Heaving a silent sigh, He Song turned around and calmly headed towards the outside of Green Wall Immortal City.   This time.   He had already completed everything he needed to do in Green Wall Immortal City.   He had enough puppet-making materials to refine several spirit puppets.   The defensive spirit amulets and life-saving spirit amulets on his person were also fully prepared.   There was no longer any value in remaining here.   Therefore.   After contemplating, He Song left Green Wall Immortal City and headed for Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate.   Up next.   He needed to return to Thick Earth Sect’s mountain gate and visit the Book Collection Pavilion to look for a spirit plant that he could cultivate, so that he could have a sufficient source of spirit stones after establishing his foundation.   Whether it was spirit rice that could increase one’s cultivation when consumed during the Foundation Establishment Realm.   Or other spirit medicines that could bring him profits, all of them could be cultivated.   Since entering the Cultivation World, he had been a spiritual plant farmer.   So, he naturally wouldn’t be unfamiliar with these things..

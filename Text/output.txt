　　 Mo Xiu came to apply early in the morning. The room was less than 30 square meters. The staff made it very clear that with the current scale of the strongest society, only such a room can be applied.
　　 But Mo Xiu didn't care. Anyway, he didn't train or select. There were only five people in total. It would be nice to have a meeting place.
　　 Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren are going to participate in the trial of the class, so Mo Xiu hurried to gather everyone for a meeting before the class.
　　 After several people came, they were very puzzled. Mo Xiu's performance yesterday clearly wanted to be the shopkeeper. How did he wake up all night?
　　 Hao Ren asked, "Mo Xiu, what are you looking for? There is no training or selection, or even recruitment."
　　 Mo Xiu said without embarrassment: "Hey, there is no need for serious clubs to get these flashy things."
　　 Dong Fang asked seriously, "Then what is there in a serious society like ours?"
　　 Mo Xiu praised: "Look at Dong Fang, you know what to ask. We are a decent society, and the decent society has tasks."
　　 Liu Ziyang heard this and finally understood what Mo Xiu wanted to do. It turned out that this was what Mo Xiu said last night? Pull the whole society into the pit?
　　 Mo Xiu took out a few printed mission materials and sent them to several people.
　　 Liu Ziyang took it over and took a look, and it was true that it was Shadow’s capture mission.
　　 Dong Fang looked a little excited when he saw the task. He had never been in contact with it before.
　　 Hao Ren and He Lingyue both looked at Mo Xiu with weird eyes after reading.
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like this?"
　　 Hao Ren asked tentatively: "Boss, have you joined the law enforcement team?"
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head.
　　 Hao Ren asked again: "Then how did you receive such a task?"
　　 Without waiting for Mo Xiu's answer, He Lingyue took over and said: "This is not the task of the law enforcement team. If the law enforcement team has such intelligence, it will definitely send a small team to arrest it, and will not post a task to wait for people to escape."
　　 Mo Xiu looked at He Lingyue with great interest. He didn't know much about He Lingyue inside, and he didn't expect to be a thoughtful girl.
　　 Hao Ren asked He Lingyue: "Then where do you think the task came from?"
　　 He Lingyue groaned slightly and said: "The news is more informed than the law enforcement team, and the mission will be released, so it can only be Shadow."
　　 Mo Xiu had to applaud for He Lingyue, and based on this clue alone, he analyzed that it was Shadow's mission.
　　 In addition to clear thinking, he also has a certain understanding of major departments. Mo Xiu is a little curious about He Lingyue's background.
　　 Liu Ziyang did not bear to say: "I'll go, the girl is amazing, and Mo Xiu and I are indeed both shadows."
　　 Mo Xiu also didn't mind Liu Ziyang's revealing his identity. When Wang Yu himself was in the universe cram school, he said that Shadow is not a secret organization that needs to be kept secret.
　　 Before in Shuncheng, he did not publicly say that he was a shadow, mainly to hide the universe cram school.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Yes, this is our shadow mission, you think about whether you want to do it with us."
　　 Before Liu Ziyang finished speaking, Hao Ren and Dong Fang weren’t convinced that they could join Shadow when they just entered university? Never heard of it before.
　　 As for He Lingyue, he only said that this was the mission of the Shadow, but he did not expect that Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang were actually members of the Shadow.
　　 Now that Mo Xiu said, how many people can be sure, are these two monsters?
　　 He Lingyue asked: "How did you join Shadow? As far as I know, Shadow’s recruitment requirements are two skills, and there is no one in the school. Many excellent people in the school can’t be selected."
　　 Mo Xiu said directly: "I can't tell you why you were selected. Do you want to participate in this mission?"
　　 Hao Ren said: "I really want to participate. After all, it is a mission for the shadows. I want to see it, but this reward... do we have a share?"
　　 Dong Fang, who has been stunned without speaking, his eyes flashed when he heard the reward, and he looked at Mo Xiu expectantly.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "The rewards have been printed on the information I just gave you. The points are 6000 and the cash reward is 4 million. Do you want to withdraw? If not, let me talk about the reward distribution."
Seeing that a few people didn’t speak, Mo Xiu continued: “This mission is divided into two stages, investigation and arrest. Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang need to go to class in the morning, so they can’t fully participate in the investigation mission and come to help after class, so yours Pay less, any comments?"
　　 The two shook their heads.
　　 "You can't use the points rewards. Liu Ziyang and I allocated 4000 points, Liu Ziyang 2000 points, Dong Fang and He Lingyue each 1.5 million in cash, Hao Ren 1 million, do you have any comments?"
　　 Mo Xiu did not have egalitarianism this time. The main reason is that these people are not very familiar with it. It is better to adopt a reasonable distribution method.
　　 Several people were very satisfied with Mo Xiu's distribution, and they considered it comprehensively, and they all nodded and agreed.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Okay, the first meeting of the strongest club has ended successfully. Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang go to class. He Lingyue and Dong Fang are ready to investigate with me."
　　 Mo Xiu suddenly thought of something, and stopped Liu Ziyang and said, "By the way, Liu Ziyang, Qiangzi is a member of your company, right? Can it be temporarily requisitioned?"
　　 Liu Ziyang said indifferently: "Of course, Qiangzi is the driver my dad arranged at Yanjing University. I have told him a long time ago that you have to go out and find him. You can contact the boss yourself."
After bidding farewell to Liu Ziyang, Mo Xiu contacted Qiangzi. Qiangzi is also from the auxiliary department. His skills are not practical and he was eliminated early in the junior class competition. This is also the reason Qiangzi came out to find a part-time job~ www.mtlnovel.com~ Qiangzi was on call, and soon drove the car to the school gate, Mo Xiu and the three got into the car.
　　 As soon as he got into the car, Qiangzi asked, "Boss, where are you going?"
　　 Mo Xiu handed the map marked on the mission data to Qiangzi.
　　 "Have you ever been to this place? Find a hidden place around you to park your car, and we walked over."
　　 Qiangzi frowned and said: "Boss, are you going to Fanjie? What are you going to do there?"
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "What's wrong there? Let's go perform the task."
　　 Qiangzi nodded and said: "Performing the task, it is very chaotic. It is in Yanjing city, but it is not under the control of Yanjing. It belongs to a chaotic zone. There are cows, ghosts and snakes there, and there is often a black market."
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "Have you been there? Do you know there?"
Qiangzi replied truthfully: "I have taken business several times. Some bosses are going to the black market to buy things there. They took me there for safety. Of course, there are many bodyguards. I have been waiting in the car and didn't go in. "
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Dong Fang and He Lingyue, wondering what they knew about Fanjie, Dong Fang shook his head and said that he didn't know.
　　 He Lingyue said: "I have been to Fanjie once. It is not as chaotic as I imagined. Most people are very disciplined, but if you offend people in it, it is very dangerous, and there are often homicides."
　　 Mo Xiu said to Qiangzi: "Okay, let's go, let's take a look first."
　　 There is one thing that Mo Xiu is very interested in. That is the black market. The source of the things in the black market is unknown, and it may be snatched. If you want to sell it, the price will inevitably be cheaper.
　　 Mo Xiu and a few people are dressed somewhat student-like, and for this reason they also bought some clothes in the mall.
　　 After the dressing was completed, a few people went straight to Fan Street...
　　

    
   


　　Mo Xiu and the three got out of the car and told Qiangzi to go back to school first, and then contact him if he had something to do, so as not to miss out.
　　 The dress of the three of them has been carefully designed, and Mo Xiu dressed very ostentatiously, looking like a rich kid.
　　He Lingyue is a famous brand, not too glamorous, showing an aristocratic temperament, acting as Mo Xiu's girlfriend.
　　 As for Dong Fang, he didn't have to dress up at all, he put on a black suit, just like a bodyguard.
　　 The three of them walked into Fan Street at this time, and when others saw it, two rich second-generation bodyguards came here for excitement.
　　 Fan Street is really a street, on both sides of the street are two rows of residential buildings.
　　 This location is very special. The location of one street and two rows of residential buildings is very special. It is surrounded by mountains and there are no other buildings around.
　　 is like a lonely tribe. Since it is surrounded by mountains, ordinary vehicles can't get in. Mo Xiu also asked Qiangzi to park the car to a far place, and the three of them overcame a mountain to get here.
　　 Just walked into the street, Mo Xiu sat down on the side of the road and said, "What the **** is this? I have to climb the mountain to come in. I'm exhausted."
　　 He Lingyue saw Mo Xiu sitting on the ground and immediately came over to persuade him: "Oh, why did you sit down? It's noon now, and may not be able to leave today. Let's find a place to stay first?"
　　 Mo Xiu jumped up when he heard this, and the resident He Lingyue's shoulder said: "Baby, why are you so anxious? This is just here, you just want to..."
　　 He Lingyue gently pushed Mo Xiu away and said, "Oh, you're so bad, please do business first."
　　 The people around them are not surprised to see Mo Xiu and He Lingyue like this. There are too many such people.
　　Mo Xiu and the three people walked roughly around, and they were surprised to find that Fan Street was not available, and all kinds of places were readily available.
　　 After looking at it, Mo Xiu almost thought it was a resort. There was no bad ethos and every shopkeeper was soliciting business.
　　Mo Xiu and the three of them entered a small restaurant, and immediately a staff member greeted him.
　　 "What do you want to eat?"
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at the clerk, and said to He Lingyue: "Baby, what do you want to eat?"
　　 He Lingyue looked at the shop furnishings with disgust.
　　 "Oh, what can this kind of shop have? Just take a bite."
　　 Mo Xiu said to the clerk: "Bring up all your best dishes, hurry up!"
　　 The clerk agreed and went down.
　　 The speed of serving dishes is indeed very fast, but the dishes are very general, they are usually some vegetarian dishes.
　　 Mo Xiu said to the clerk dissatisfied: "What did I say to you? Did you not understand what I said just now? I want your best dish."
　　 The clerk became a lot harder after serving the dishes, and said disdainfully: "What? Is this boss looking for something? This is our best dish!"
　　 Mo Xiu patted the table, and Dong Fang immediately stood up and grabbed the clerk by the collar.
　　 The clerk was caught, without a trace of panic, and shouted: "Someone is making trouble!"
　　 In the small shop that was originally small, seven or eight people appeared from nowhere, and surrounded the three of Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu stood up and shouted at the group of people: "Oh, is this trying to corrupt me? Do you know who I am?"
　　 One of the big guys came over and said, “It’s no use who you are here. Fanjie speaks by strength without asking for your name. Today you ate the food obediently and settled the account, and there is nothing wrong.”
　　 Mo Xiu said angrily: "You...you!"
　　 At this time, He Lingyue said to the big man: "Misunderstandings, they are all misunderstandings. We originally wanted to have a simple bite."
　　 then whispered to Mo Xiu: "Okay, don't forget our purpose here."
　　 Mo Xiu listened to the anger and sat back, Dong Fang also let go of the clerk and sit down.
　　 The big man smiled and said, "Boy, look at your girl, it's better than you."
　　 Mo Xiu turned his head and ignored the big man.
　　 The big man said to He Lingyue with a squinting look: "Beauty, I'm a prisoner, come to me when it's convenient?"
　　 When Mo Xiu heard this, he shouted angrily: "I'm going to your mother, do you dare to molest my woman?"
　　 The prisoner left with a laugh.
　　 Mo Xiu was still talking on the table, and the people watching laughed. Isn't this just because you have no patience and only pretends to be forced?
　　 After eating, Mo Xiu went to the front desk to check out, and the four vegetarian dishes totaled 5,000 yuan.
　　 Mo Xiu twitched rationally, but on the surface he dumped cash indifferently.
　　 After the checkout, Mo Xiu left with an unhappy expression, but He Lingyue stayed.
　　 He Lingyue found the prisoner just now and asked, "This big brother."
　　 The prisoner saw He Lingyue hehe and smiled, "What's wrong with the beauty? Are you tired of your useless boyfriend and want something exciting?"
　　 He Lingyue said helplessly: "Hey, if it wasn't for helplessness, who would want to talk to him, I came to inquire about something."
　　 The prisoner asked, "What's the matter?"
　　 "We came here to shop for something on the black market. I heard that the black market here is even more complete than the market, but we just went around and didn't find the black market."
　　 When the prisoner saw that He Lingyue had something to ask for, he immediately lost interest.
　　 "It's okay to tell you, you can either trade money, then trade you. In this place, no one will help you, everything is a deal."
　　 He Lingyue said: "Take the money for it!"
　　 The prisoner stretched out three fingers and said, "I won't cheat you, thirty thousand!"
　　 He Lingyue took out 30,000 cash from the bag and handed it to the prisoner.
　　 The prisoner took the money and weighed it up and said: "The black market starts at 12 o'clock every night. It's on the street. There is a small market a day, and a big one three days. The big market has just ended, and there will be a big market the next night."
　　 He Lingyue nodded, without saying anything, turned and walked out of the shop.
　　 Mo Xiu and Dong Fang are waiting at the door, UU reading www. uukanshu.com He Lingyue glanced at each other after coming out.
　　 He Lingyue said: "Let’s find a place to rest first, it’s very tiring."
　　 Mo Xiu said lazily: "Okay, hurry up and find a place to live. I'm exhausted along the way."
　　It’s easy to find a place to live. There is only one hotel in Fanjie. What is unexpected is that the scale is not small. It occupies an entire building. There is a big slogan outside the hotel, “A haven in Fanjie”.
　　Because it is a residential building, the rooms inside are all ordinary apartment types. Mo Xiu chose a two-bedroom and one-living room. There is no need to show an ID card, and even the name does not need to be graded, just take money and a deposit.
　　 The three of them just entered the room, and Dong Fang said, "We..."
　　 Halfway through, Mo Xiu interrupted directly.
　　 "What are you doing standing here? Don't affect our interest, go back to your own room."
After 　　, Mo Xiu and He Lingyue looked at each other and began to look for them in the room.
　　 After half an hour, Mo Xiu said: "Dong Fang, how is your room?"
　　 Dong Fang came out and said, "I just knew you were afraid of being monitored. I looked for that room and there was nothing."
　　 The three of them sat on the sofa, and Mo Xiu asked He Lingyue: "How are you asking? Where is the black market?"
　　 He Lingyue told Mo Xiu all the information the prisoners had said about the black market.
　　At this time, Dong Fang said puzzledly: "Mo Xiu, didn't we come to find Wang Jinyang? Why are you still acting?"
Mo Xiu explained: "You can just play your bodyguard. If we come directly to Wang Jinyang, we will not only stun the snake, but also cause dissatisfaction in this place. Have you seen what happened in the restaurant just now? Here? Not as peaceful as on the surface."
　　

 
       
 
           


　　 He Lingyue took over and said, "If you want to find Wang Jinyang along the vine, the best way is to enter the black market and lead him out, right?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded, and now I feel more and more that the girl He Lingyue is very smart. I haven't discussed it before coming, but she has been cooperating well just now.
　　 Mo Xiu saw that Dong Fang still didn't quite understand, and then he explained.
　　 "Remember the information given by the mission? Wang Jinyang robbed the bank, he had a lot of cash, and a spiritual gathering grass. This grass is the key. I guess he has a great possibility and is ready to shoot here."
　　 Dong Fang asked: "But how can you be sure that Wang Jinyang has not sold yet?"
　　 Mo Xiu said: "I cherish the herbs whose origins are unknown. If it were me, I would not easily sell it. I would definitely find a fool to raise the price."
　　 He Lingyue covered her mouth and pointed at Mo Xiu and said, "Mo Xiu is playing this fool right now."
　　 Dong Fang suddenly said, "Well, Mo Xiu, you performed the essence. If I were Wang Jinyang, I would sell it to a fool like you."
　　 Mo Xiu gave Dong Fang a blank look. Now what a few people have to do is to wait until 12 o'clock in the evening to go out and see the black market.
　　 Then Liu Ziyang sent a message.
　　 "Boss, Hao Ren and I are out of class, will I look for you now?"
　　 He Lingyue took a closer look and said, "There is no need for them to come, right? We are just like this right now. They may come together, which may arouse others' suspicion."
　　 Mo Xiu thought for a while and said: "Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren don't have to join us. They can act alone and have their own use."
　　 He Lingyue asked: "What's the use?"
　　 "You said that Wang Jinyang came here for other purposes besides selling herbs and refuge?"
　　 He Lingyue pondered for a moment and shook her head, without expecting other possibilities.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Hahaha, women don't understand..."
　　 said, replying to Liu Ziyang's message on the phone.
　　 Dong Fang did not listen to the conversation between the two at this time, but turned on the TV, laughing.
　　......
At 11:30 in the evening, the three of Mo Xiu went downstairs and when they walked to the hotel counter, Mo Xiu asked, "Hey, buddy, this Fan Street is so awesome, is there... that kind of place? It's just flowers. Where can you play with money?"
　　 The little brother at the counter glanced at He Lingyue, and then said, "Yes, just ahead. It's easy to find at night."
　　 Mo Xiu smiled and said, "Hey, thank you buddy."
　　 and gave the counter guy one, you know the look in his eyes.
　　 He Lingyue grabbed Mo Xiu's ear and said, "We're here to do serious business, do you dare to try it?"
　　 The three people walked out of the hotel, He Lingyue appeared on the street with Mo Xiu's arm, and Dong Fang followed them.
　　 It is not twelve o'clock, and some people are already preparing to set up a stall.
　　Mo Xiu took a closer look. Most of the people who set up the stall were local people living here, and some of them were selling things from outside.
　　 At the same time, Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang also came here.
　　 Hao Ren asked, "Brother Liu, what is our mission?"
　　 Liu Ziyang said triumphantly: "After my struggle, the task for the two of us is very simple."
　　 "What mission?"
　　 Liu Ziyang took out a printed photo of Wang Jinyang and handed it to Hao Ren.
　　 "Remember Wang Jinyang's looks, the rest is to play."
　　 Neither of them looked at the black market emerging on the street, and went straight to the kind of place Moxiu said.
　　 This scene happened to be seen by He Lingyue.
　　 He Lingyue approached Mo Xiu's ear and asked, "This is your arrangement? Is this something women don't understand?"
　　 Mo Xiu replied: "A man who came here with so much cash and a precious herb, instead of flying away, can only have two purposes, one is to sell medicine to make money, and the other is to spend money for fun."
　　 He Lingyue said in an insignificant voice: "Indecent!"
　　 The three of them walked, and the whole black market had already appeared in its entirety. There were stalls on both sides of Fanjie Road.
　　Mo Xiu went to a squat to see if there were any good things, but looking around, they were all common herbs and weapons, and asked about the price. It was about 30% lower than the market price, which was still quite impressive.
　　 From a rough look, there is no heavyweight. Only after chatting with the stall owner, I discovered that good things are not available, either appearing on the market, or occasionally someone is anxious and has to take it out.
　　 The three of Mo Xiu turned around. When they were about to go back to sleep, something on a booth attracted Mo Xiu's attention.
　　 is a short black scabbard. The reason why Mo Xiu is interested in this is because the dagger Don't give him a scabbard before.
　　 The black dagger is so sharp that it is inconvenient to carry without a scabbard.
　　 Mo Xiu squatted down and did not directly ask the price of the scabbard, but pointed to a herbal medicine he didn't recognize.
　　 "Boss, what is this?"
　　 The stall owner saw that Mo Xiu was cheating, and opened his mouth: "This is an extremely precious herb that can strengthen your body."
　　 Mo Xiu's eyes lit up and said, "Oh? Doesn't it improve the body much? I came here this time to find herbs to improve physical fitness. As long as things are good, how much money is not a problem."
　　 When the boss saw Mo Xiu's idiotic look, he immediately praised him.
　　 "Needless to say the effect of the medicine, the energy contained in it is extremely strong, reaching the spiritual level, even if you are cheaper, the price is 500,000."
　　 Mo Xiu is amused. Herbs are divided into four levels according to the energy they contain. Human level is the more expensive herbs on the market, most of which are used to strengthen the body.
　　It's different when it comes to spirit level. It can have a breakthrough growth in one aspect. For example, spirit rings that can upgrade skills from level one to level two are spiritual level herbs.
　　 And Mo Xiu had never seen the herbs of the earth-level and heaven-level. The spirit-gathering grass stolen by Wang Jinyang this time was at the top level of the spirit-level, and its function was to completely improve the physical fitness. UU reading www.uukanshu. com
　　 And the broken herbal medicine on the boss's booth is open to question until it reaches the human level.
　　 Although what he thought was that the boss was really dark, Mo Xiu looked very emotional on the surface, and he was about to pay for it.
　　 He Lingyue stopped and said: "If we don't buy it, you are too ruthless, boss? This thing looks like a weed, let's go."
　　 The boss saw that he was seen through, and immediately stopped Mo Xiu.
　　 "Hey hey, don't leave, a few people, I have something novel, do you want to take a look?"
　　 When Mo Xiu heard something novel, he just stood up and squatted down again.
　　 "Boss, what is it? Show it out!"
　　 The boss took out something from his pocket, and Mo Xiu looked at it carefully. It was a pistol.
　　 He Lingyue obviously did not expect that there would be a banned thermal weapon in this place.
　　 Mo Xiu snatched it over and held it in his hand.
　　 The boss smiled and said: "Be careful, this is okay, don't go off the hook, you aristocratic children like this kind of thing the most."
　　 He Lingyue asked: "Boss, how much is it? The price is fair. I think even if this is a black market, this kind of stuff can't be sold on the spot, right?"
　　 The boss said: "The girl is right, how about selling you for 100,000?"
　　 Mo Xiu took out one hundred thousand and handed it to the boss and said: "The deal, I didn't bargain, you have to give me something."
　　 The boss pointed to the herbal medicine that Mo Xiu just looked at and said, "How can this medicine be given to you?"
　　 Mo Xiu grabbed the scabbard and said, "I don't want the broken grass, just grab something."
　　 Turn around and leave after speaking.
　　 The boss shouted straight from behind: No, you come back, I will send you something else... Hey, I lost it, I lost it. "

　　Mo Xiu and the three did not go shopping anymore and went straight back to the hotel.
　　 Mo Xiu put the black dagger into the scabbard as soon as he came back.
　　 And this scabbard is not simple, I don’t know what material it is, it’s as smooth as jade.
　　 He Lingyue saw this and said, "Your goal at the beginning was this scabbard, right?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded.
　　 He Lingyue continued: "Your dagger is so beautiful, what's your name?"
　　 Mo Xiu was taken aback, yes, what's the name of the black dagger?
　　 "Just call him...Hei Lin."
　　 "What a good name."
　　 Mo Xiu took out his pistol and said, "But I didn't expect that this time there would be an unexpected gain."
　　 He Lingyue said with a serious expression after seeing the pistol: "Yes, this is really unexpected."
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "I don't know much about this. Do you know that there have been overheated weapons in recent years?"
　　 Mo Xiu and He Lingyue looked at Dong Fang. This guy turned on the TV and laughed as soon as he returned to the hotel. It was almost hopeless.
　　 He Lingyue said: "I know a little bit about the news of Yanjing City. There are indeed many people who make trouble in Yanjing City, but they use heat weapons... I haven't heard of it for so many years."
　　 Mo Xiu put the pistol away and said, "Okay, let's not talk about it for now. You can investigate after this mission is over."
　　 In the shadow system, in addition to internal tasks in the software, you can also create tasks by yourself. After the tasks are completed, the system will automatically rank and give corresponding rewards. If conditions permit, Mo Xiu wants to investigate.
　　 He Lingyue asked: "What are we doing now?"
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at his watch and said, "Wait!"
　　 "Waiting for what?"
　　 "Wait for those two ghosts to come back."
　　......
　　 An hour later, Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang helped each other back to the hotel.
　　 Mo Xiu has all checked in the hotel, without any surveillance, it can really be regarded as a safe haven in Fanjie.
　　 So the two did not go back to their own room, but went straight to the room of the three of Mo Xiu.
As soon as 　　 entered the door, the two of them collapsed on the sofa, squeezing Dong Fang, who was originally watching TV on the sofa, aside.
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "How is it?"
　　 Liu Ziyang volunteered and said: "I am! I am! It's awesome inside, that girl, hey! Awesome!"
　　 Hao Ren smirked and said, "Hey, there is a beautiful woman I have been staring at all night, and finally I didn't dare to go up and talk."
　　 Liu Ziyang hated iron and steel, and said: "You are really useless. What kind of seriousness can the women who come here have? If you think it's good, you can go there, I have no money to get it for you."
　　 He Lingyue pouted and looked at Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu was also a little embarrassed. Originally asked the two men to investigate Wang Jinyang, but they didn't expect them to say this.
　　 Mo Xiu said loudly: "Hey hey hey! You two, how about your mission? Did you find Wang Jinyang?"
　　 Liu Ziyang was a little dazed, looked at Hao Ren and said, "Did you see Wang Jinyang?"
　　 Hao Ren asked suspiciously: "Huh? Who is Wang Jinyang? Is that girl today???"
　　 Liu Ziyang realized his mistake and immediately apologized to Mo Xiu.
　　 "Boss, listen to me, neither of us has been to such a place. We were a little lost as soon as we entered, but... the two of us looked very carefully, Wang Jinyang shouldn't show up."
　　 He Lingyue said dissatisfied: "Should? Did you perform the task or go to play?"
　　 When He Lingyue said this, the two of them were completely drunk, and honestly sat upright on the sofa.
　　 Just like that, Mo Xiu watched He Lingyue persuade and educate him for half an hour.
　　 In the end, it may be that He Lingyue was tired, she shook her head and sighed and went back to the room to sleep.
Before leaving, 　　 even said to Mo Xiu: "This is the way! This is what women don't understand!"
　　Mo Xiu didn't quite understand, how could He Lingyue be so magnificent.
　　 After He Lingyue entered the room, Mo Xiu asked, "You can tell me what's going on inside."
　　 When they said this, Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren swept away their previous depression and talked freely.
　　 During the narration, it is not the two who are most excited, but Dong Fang watching the excitement.
　　 Dong Fang cried out after listening.
　　 "Fuck, Mo Xiu, if you don't arrange such a good task for me, what kind of bodyguard would you let me be?"
　　 "Brother Liu Ziyang, can we change the two?"
　　 "Go go, I'm going back to sleep, and I have to participate in the class match tomorrow."
　　 "Brother Hao Ren..."
　　 "Goodbye!"
　　 Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren went back, and Mo Xiu sat on the sofa thinking.
　　According to the description of the two, this place is similar to a nightclub, but the difference is that the women in it are basically staff members, and you only need to take money if you want to do anything.
　　 If this is the case, Mo Xiu thinks that Wang Jinyang is very likely to go there, unless Wang Jinyang is curved.
　　 speechless all night.
　　 The next day, Mo Xiu woke up, sat on the sofa and waited for He Lingyue and Dong Fang to get up.
　　 Mo Xiu wanted to sleep in the room last night, but He Lingyue was a girl, so she naturally wanted her own room. Dong Fang was too bulky to sleep on the sofa, so she could only let Mo Xiu sleep on the sofa in the living room.
　　 After the two woke up, Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang had already rushed back to school.
　　 After the three people converged, they made a fool of another in Fanjie.
　　 The image of Mo Xiu, a mindless brother, appeared on Fan Street for two consecutive days.
　　 Many people want to take the opportunity to kill Mo Xiu for a while, but they all know that this young man is accompanied by a shrewd girlfriend, and it is not easy to start at a time.
　　 In the early morning, Mo Xiu took He Lingyue and the bodyguard Dong Fang around the black market again, feeling bored and returned to the room early.
　　 Not long after, Mo Xiu sneaked out and went straight to the place.
　　 Mo Xiu was shocked by the scene as soon as he entered the arena, no wonder Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren came here yesterday and even forgot to perform the task.
The lights here are dim, with red tones as the mainstay~www.mtlnovel.com~ The music is not as loud as expected, but rather quiet music. The women inside have different dressing styles, and they are all relatively cool. Kind of high-level sense.
　　 Mo Xiu quickly retracted his gaze and searched in the hall. First, he saw Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren. They also saw Mo Xiu and were winking.
　　 Mo Xiu took out his mobile phone and looked at it, and Liu Ziyang sent a message.
　　 "Find the target, in your eight o'clock direction."
　　 Mo Xiu swept over inadvertently, and it turned out to be Wang Jinyang.
　　 But after seeing Wang Jinyang, Mo Xiu frowned and sent a message to Liu Ziyang.
　　 After waiting for a while, Mo Xiu walked towards Wang Jinyang's direction with a smile.
　　 walked to a nearby location, hugged a woman next to him and said: "Baby, play for a while?"
　　 The woman was stunned and before she could speak, a figure slammed into Mo Xiu's shoulder, stumbling into Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't ask, so he directly cursed: "Damn, who doesn't have eyes?"
　　It was Liu Ziyang who hit Mo Xiu. Liu Ziyang said with a strange smile: "Yeah, isn't this Young Master Xiao? Why are you here? What can you do?"
　　 Mo Xiu saw that Liu Ziyang immediately softened.
　　 "Damn, it's unlucky, how could I run into you bitch."
　　 At this time, the woman who was just held by Mo Xiu said: "Boss, don't be angry, you say how to play, I will accompany you."
　　 Mo Xiu shook off the woman's hand and said, "Stop the fun, stop playing."
　　 After speaking and leaving, Liu Ziyang said to Hao Ren: "This silly fork, impotence is still humiliated."
　　 Hao Ren echoed: "Yes, people are stupid and have a lot of money."
　　 The two were about to leave while chatting, but there was a voice behind them.
　　 "Two of you, wait a minute..."
　　

 
       
 
           


　　The person who spoke was Wang Jinyang.
　　 Liu Ziyang turned around and glanced at Wang Jinyang and said, "What's the matter?"
　　Wang Jinyang leaned on the back counter and said, "Do you know the brother just now?"
　　 Hao Ren said, "What is it, brother? That man is just rubbish, he is nothing but a lot of money."
　　 Liu Ziyang looked at Wang Jinyang, and said with some caution: "What's the matter with you?"
　　 "I want to know all the information about that person just now."
　　 Liu Ziyang said disdainfully: "Brother, although we have only been here for a few days, we also know the rules of Fanjie. If you want to know the news, you have to change it with money."
　　Wang Jinyang directly took out a wad of money from his bag, put it in his hand, and said, "Fifty thousand, I want to know the information of that person just now."
　　 Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren looked at each other and said, "Okay, no problem, what do you want to know?"
　　Wang Jinyang stretched out three fingers and said: "One, the basic information of this person. Two, how rich is this person? What did you come to Fanjie for? Three, I ask for confidentiality, and I cannot tell anyone that I have disclosed the information."
　　 Liu Ziyang snatched the money and said: "Deal!"
　　 "This person is called Xiao Qing, and he has a lot of power behind him. There is so much money that you can't imagine. As for what you are doing here? I can guess a little bit."
　　 Wang Jinyang leaned close to Liu Ziyang and listened carefully.
Liu Ziyang continued: "He has a problem with that. Don’t look at bringing a girlfriend all day, but it’s actually only a minute. Didn’t you see his girlfriend’s desire and dissatisfaction all day? I guess he came here to buy energy. Cure his medicine, hahaha."
　　 Hao Ren also laughed at the side, and the two of them hurt Mo Xiu again.
　　 After hearing this, Wang Jinyang was very satisfied, nodded and said: "Okay, the transaction is over, you two have never seen me."
　　 Liu Ziyang grabbed Wang Jinyang's arm and said, "Man, do you have any good ideas to cheat him? We can help you!"
　　Wang Jinyang knocked out Liu Ziyang's hand, his eyes were fierce, and his eyes were obviously killing intent.
　　 was so scared that Liu Ziyang quickly retracted his hand and said tremblingly: "You go, you go!"
　　Wang Jinyang stared at Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren and said, "If I find out that you spread this out, your life will be optimistic."
　　 Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren fled back to the hotel and came to the room of the three of Mo Xiu.
　　 After entering the room, Liu Ziyang immediately wailed and said to Hao Ren: "Tell the boss, how am I doing?"
　　 Hao Ren gave a thumbs up and said: "Brother Liu's acting skills are really great, especially the horror and fear he showed after being threatened by Wang Jinyang. It's so vivid!"
　　 Liu Ziyang's expression was a bit complicated at this time. The scene just now can be played throughout. Hao Ren insisted on playing this. At that time, where was the acting, it was really scary to see Wang Jinyang moved to kill.
　　 Mo Xiu waved his hand and said, "You two are all right, how are you talking about it?"
　　 Hao Ren told Mo Xiu about what happened, and Mo Xiu asked a lot of details, and then he was relieved after he was sure that Wang Jinyang was not suspicious.
　　 "Well, yes, you two finally didn't have the reputation of being a lascivious person. Something was done. Wang Jinyang has already hooked up, and I will wait for tomorrow."
　　 Mo Xiu said and glanced at He Lingyue, saying, "Is my method okay?" ’
　　 He Lingyue said: "Unexpectedly, your two acting skills are also so good."
　　 Liu Ziyang proudly said: "That's a must, but thanks to the professional guidance of King Mo throughout the afternoon."
　　 Yes, in order to make these two people perform this play well, Mo Xiu taught the whole afternoon and practiced it countless times.
　　Everything is ready, just wait for Wang Jinyang to come to the door tomorrow, and then lead him to an uninhabited place for arrest.
　　 Dispersed from the people, Mo Xiu thought on the sofa alone.
　　 It seems that everything is under control, but in reality there are many uncertainties.
When I went to find Wang Jinyang today, Mo Xiu actually thought of two plans. As soon as he entered, he would use God's Snoopy on Wang Jinyang. If they were weak, Mo Xiu, Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren would do it directly, but the results they saw made Mo Xiu. Very worried.
　　"One Skill: Extreme Sword
　　 Skill effect: Summon a sword as a weapon, increase the power by 100% during use
　　 Duration: 3 minutes
　　 Cooling time: 3 hours
　　 Two skills: Explosion
　　 Skill effect: summon a fireball to damage
　　 Cooling time: 25 minutes
　　 Three skills: Spirit flash stab
　　 Skill effect: After release, quickly assault in the specified direction, at a distance of 5 meters, invincible and unable to attack in the assault state
　　 Cooling time: 3 hours
　　Four Skills: Stealth 2
　　 Skill effect: After opening, enter the invisible state
　　 Duration: 5 minutes
　　Cooling time: 12 hours"
　　 This is Wang Jinyang's skill. The four skills do not belong to the same category. The skills are complex but difficult to deal with.
　　 Mo Xiu originally thought that Wang Jinyang could rob the bank, and he should have a few strong offensive skills.
　　 But now it seems that the real difficulty is how to catch him.
　　 One, two, two skills are easy to understand, and they are not particularly strong, and you should not get hurt when you pay a little attention to them.
　　The last two skills that are difficult to handle, needless to say invisible, once you lose track, it is difficult to find.
　　 But if you only have invisibility skills, you can catch Wang Jinyang at the moment of invisibility.
　　 The three skills that are really difficult to handle are these three skills. On their own, this skill is very tasteless. It can only penetrate five meters and cannot attack, but it is very strong when used with stealth skills.
　　 After turning on the invisibility, he immediately releases the three skills to advance. During the period, he is invincible. If he is not careful, he will lose Wang Jinyang's trail.
　　 The only problem facing Mo Xiu now is how to catch Wang Jinyang.
　　......
In the early morning of the second day, today was the third day when Mo Xiu came here, and it was also the day of the black market. It was also the best time to arrest Wang Jinyang~www.mtlnovel.com~ Mo Xiu, as usual, brought congratulations in the morning. Ling Yue and Dong Fang squatted around Fan Street.
　　 intentionally or unintentionally mentioned that I will buy something on the black market tonight, some of which are money but I don’t know if there are any good things.
　　 After a round, return to the hotel in the afternoon.
　　 And Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren came to the hotel silently at this time.
　　Mo Xiu waited for the two to arrive, and immediately called everyone to a meeting with a serious expression.
　　 Liu Ziyang said: "Boss, what else is going on here? I think you just need to recharge your energy and wait until night to lead Wang Jinyang to no one, click!"
　　 said, he wiped the neck with his right hand.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Don't be careless, do you think the strength of the five of us will be stronger than the bank guard?"
　　 Everyone was silent, yes, Wang Jinyang robbed the bank.
　　 Mo Xiu continued: "As you can see from the data, he has a stealth skill. I guess he escaped hunting by the stealth skill."
　　 He Lingyue frowned and said: "But we don't know what his skills are, how to arrange them?"
　　 Mo Xiu smiled and said: "Then imagine the worst possibility, his concealment skills disappear out of thin air!"
　　 Several people looked at Mo Xiu with weird eyes, and they could not catch Mo Xiu if he disappeared out of thin air and played a fart.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at a few people and continued: "Well, no one can catch the disappearance out of thin air. If the worst possibility of disappearing out of thin air is eliminated, he will become invisible, how about?"
　　 He Lingyue's eyes lit up and said, "This is reliable. The worst case we may face is to be invisible. Specifically, how to do it? What are the plans?"
　　 Mo Xiu smiled and said, "I need to know what your skills are?"

　　 "I need to know what your skills are?"
　　Except for Liu Ziyang, everyone else was surprised, because asking about skills directly is a very unreasonable behavior, even teammates, they gradually become familiar with them after constant running-in.
　　 Among those present, only Liu Ziyang knew the terrible Mo Xiu, Mo Xiu's precise grasp of the battle situation, and the development of skills.
　　 Liu Ziyang saw that the others did not speak, and said first: "I will come first, my skills are..."
Mo Xiu interrupted directly: "Needless to say, I know, if you feel uneasy, let me talk about my own first. My skill is a status type skill. After opening it, it will increase all attributes by 300%. "
　　静! The room was quiet, and even Liu Ziyang knew that Mo Xiu's skills had been upgraded. It was originally a 100% improvement, but now it has suddenly become 300%.
　　 But this 300% is too scary, right? And it's all attributes, and a few people have never heard of the ability to add all attributes.
　　 Hao Ren swallowed and said: "Mo...Boss Mo, you deserve to be the number one in the college entrance examination, and you deserve to be the shadow..."
　　 He Lingyue also said in shock: "Mo Xiu, take the liberty to ask, your skills have been upgraded to level 3?"
　　 "Two-level skills, okay, who will talk about your skills next?"
　　 He Lingyue has always known that Mo Xiu is very strong, but he didn't know that Mo Xiu's potential was so great.
　　 Dong Fang was the first to say: "My skill is called Golden Body. After release, it increases defense power by 200%, attack power by 100%, and skin hardens."
　　 Another perversion, Mo Xiu saw it during the last class match, Dong Fang must have very strong skills.
　　 After Dong Fang finished speaking, everyone seemed to let go.
　　 Hao Ren said: "My skill is a heavy punch, which instantly increases my attack by 500%."
　　 He Lingyue saw what everyone else said, and said: "My skill is to predict, to predict the next action of others."
　　 Mo Xiu looked at He Lingyue with bright eyes.
　　 Liu Ziyang said in Mo Xiu's ear: "Boss, don't forget you have Mu Qingyi!"
　　 Mo Xiu pushed Liu Ziyang away, and said to He Lingyue: "Specifically, under what conditions can it be predicted?"
　　 He Lingyue reluctantly said: "Within three meters of mine."
　　 Mo Xiu lowered his head to think. In fact, Mo Xiu had seen the skills of these people with God's prying eyes, and there was not much difference between them.
　　 What shocked Mo Xiu the most was He Lingyue, the complete skill is.
　　"Skills: Future Man 2
　　 Skill effect: Specify a target to be the future person, and predict the next action of other people within three meters of the body.
　　 Duration: 7 minutes
　　Cooling time: 6 hours"
　　 This skill has once again refreshed Mo Xiu's cognition. This should belong to the ability of the power system. It may be because the skill can be applied to others. He Lingyue only reported the auxiliary system.
　　 Mo Xiu was thinking, and Liu Ziyang shouted from the side: "Boss, I haven't introduced the skills yet."
　　 Mo Xiu said impatiently: "I know your skills."
　　 "But..."
　　 "No need, but you can tell them about your skills so that you can cooperate at night."
Seeing Mo Xiu's attitude, Liu Ziyang simply ignored Mo Xiu and said to several others: "My skills can turn into afterimages, and then appear anywhere within five meters of the original position. You can activate the first within five seconds. The second stage of skills, once again turned into afterimages, improved..."
　　 "Wait! What did you say?"
　　 Mo Xiu interrupted Liu Ziyang and said in disbelief: "Your skills have been upgraded? Can you start the second stage independently?"
　　 Liu Ziyang stretched out his hands and said: "Yes, I have always wanted to tell you, but you won't give me a chance."
　　 Mo Xiu looked straight at Liu Ziyang, Liu Ziyang looked hairy.
　　 "Boss, just say what you have to say, don't look at me like that."
　　 "Things are simple, just cooperate with me in a play."
　　 After a second, several people said together: "Listen to Mr. Mo's arrangement!"
　　......
　　 At 11:30 in the evening, Mo Xiu appeared on the Fanjie black market on time.
　　Mo Xiu and the three of them turned around. The big market that happened only once in the past three days is indeed different. If it weren't for the task, I really wanted to search for something and go back.
　　 After turning around, Mo Xiu had long found Wang Jinyang in the corner to observe himself.
　　 Mo Xiu took a chance and shouted: "This is the black market in Fanjie? It's not good, right? There is nothing I want at all."
　　 He Lingyue comforted and said: "What we are looking for is not an ordinary thing. It is possible that some stall owners have it but did not take it out. Let's ask separately."
　　 Mo Xiu sighed and said, "Okay, okay, this broken place, after waiting for three days, there is nothing."
　　 The three moved separately. Instead of talking to the stall owner, Mo Xiu found an open space to sit down and lazily.
　　 After a while, a hand was placed on Mo Xiu's shoulder.
　　 Mo Xiu snapped it off and said, "Who?"
　　The person here is Wang Jinyang who has been observing for a long time, not just tonight, but since Mo Xiu first entered Fan Street.
　　Wang Jinyang came to Fanjie for 13 days. Every day, he squatted at the corner of Fanjie to observe the passing of pedestrians.
　　 Mo Xiu's arrogant mentally retarded behavior when he first came to Fanjie attracted Wang Jinyang's attention. After three days of observation, Mo Xiu felt that Mo Xiu was the most suitable trading partner.
　　 Yesterday, I found out that his real name was Xiao Qing from Liu Ziyang. Wang Jinyang secretly checked it and found that there was someone, so I was relieved.
　　 Mo Xiu's arrogant appearance did not make Wang Jinyang angry.
　　 Wang Jinyang sat next to Mo Xiu and said, "Brother, I know you, your name is Liu Neng."
　　 Mo Xiu yelled, "Are you sick? What kind of **** Liu Neng, I'm Xiao Qing."
　　 Even though he said so, Mo Xiu was a little surprised. This Wang Jinyang was really cautious, and he was still trying.
　　 Wang Jinyang did not answer Mo Xiu's words, UU read www.uukanshu.com and said to himself: "Xiao Qing, I know your physical defects."
　　 Mo Xiu furiously said, "Who are you? I have no flaws."
　　 "Hey? Don't worry, I have medicine that can cure your disease."
　　 Liu Jinyang knew that a wealthy and powerful son like Xiao Qing who suffered from this disease, as long as he could be cured, the elders in the family would be willing to pay as much money as possible.
　　 So I deliberately lose my appetite and want to slaughter it hard.
　　 Mo Xiu calmed down when he heard this, and whispered: "You really have one? I can tell you, I can't lie."
　　 Liu Jinyang did not speak, took out a box and opened it to Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu's eyes flashed when he saw what was inside.
　　 "This... this is... the Spirit Gathering Grass?"
　　 "Brother, keep your voice down. When someone else hears you, everyone is rushing to buy this herbal medicine, and you still have your share? I heard that you are unspeakable, and I want to sell you personally."
　　 Mo Xiu immediately covered his mouth and whispered, "How much is this?"
　　 "You need this thing, you should know the price, you can make a price."
　　 "I pay 10 million!"
　　 Wang Jinyang closed the box, got up in his arms, and left.
　　 Mo Xiu hurried to catch up and stop Wang Jinyang.
　　 "Dude, don't you say that the price is not right? Don't go!"
　　 Wang Jinyang looked like he didn't want to talk anymore and said, "You go to find out what the market price is outside? There is no market for this thing, and you pay 10 million? I think you don't want to buy it sincerely.
　　 After talking about Wang Jinyang, he walked around Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu shouted from behind: "Thirty million!"
 "Fifty million!"
　　 "One hundred million!"
　　 Wang Jinyang paused and stopped.

　　 "One hundred million? Then I can talk about it."
　　 Mo Xiu said with a painful look: "Brother, what is your name? Let's talk about it. It will be more difficult for me to get 100 million."
　　 Wang Jinyang thought for a while, one hundred million should be the opponent's limit, and the energy contained in the Spirit Gathering Grass can reach the peak of the spiritual level.
　　 But it does not have the intuitive effect of Linghuan, which can directly increase the level of a skill, so the price between the two is almost the same, and 100 million has also reached Wang Jinyang's psychological expectation.
　　 "You don't need to ask more about the name. The lowest price I can accept is 100 million. You also know how hot this thing is. Give you ten seconds to think about it. If you can, I will trade. If not, I will find someone else."
　　 Mo Xiu said quickly: "Yes, you can, no problem!"
　　 "I only need cash!"
　　 Mo Xiu said embarrassedly: "If it's cash, I need to discuss it with my people."
　　 Wang Jinyang directly sat on the ground and said, "Okay! Hurry up."
　　 Mo Xiu quickly found He Lingyue and Dong Fang, and then talked with He Lingyue, and from time to time he looked in Wang Jinyang's direction.
　　 The conversation ended, and He Lingyue walked towards Wang Jinyang.
　　 "This big brother, can you show me the treasures?"
　　 Wang Jinyang didn't mind, he opened the box and showed it to He Lingyue.
　　 He Lingyue smiled and said, "Brother, can you discuss the price again?"
Wang Jinyang looked at Mo Xiu directly and said, "Brother Xiao Qing, your woman is bargaining with me. Haven't we already negotiated it? Do you still want to listen to your woman? I'm not selling the grind like this. ."
　　 When Mo Xiu heard this, he dashed forward and pulled He Lingyue behind him.
　　 "I have negotiated the price with this brother, it's only 100 million, not a cent less."
　　 Wang Jinyang snickered, this man is really an idiot.
　　 He Lingyue was still unwilling, and asked Wang Jinyang: "Then you want cash, how can you get so much money?"
　　Wang Jinyang spread his hands and said, "You come out for 100 million yuan. Would you mind giving me a car?"
　　 He Lingyue said helplessly: "Okay, but we don't have so much cash now, we need to go to the bank to get it. The transaction here is not very convenient, you see..."
　　 Wang Jinyang said: "I can wait for you to withdraw the money, but I will decide the place of the transaction."
　　 He Lingyue nodded and said, "No problem, where is the location? We will go to you after we withdraw the money."
　　 "No, Xiao Qing must be with me, until the end of the transaction, you two can go and withdraw money."
　　 He Lingyue looked at Dong Fang, and sighed and said, "Hey! Okay, I'll let the bodyguard go to withdraw the money, and Xiao Qing and I will be with you."
　　 Wang Jinyang nodded, and took Mo Xiu and He Lingyue to a mountain behind Fan Street.
　　 There are few trees on this mountain and it is not steep. Anyone with better driving skills can come up and leave by car.
　　 What made Mo Xiu most concerned about was that the place Wang Jinyang chose for the transaction had no trees around it, it was an open area, and the ground was hard soil and no leaves.
　　 Once Wang Jinyang turns on his invisibility in this place and loses his trace, it will be difficult to find.
　　 No wonder Wang Jinyang can rob the bank and retreat all over his body. He is really too cautious in doing things.
　　Wang Jinyang chatted with Mo Xiu and He Lingyue while waiting for the money.
　　 "Brother Xiao Qing, have you been ill for a few years? You will be cured soon, let’s talk about it."
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head and sighed: "Don't mention it, how many years will this thing still be sick? It's just like that."
　　 Wang Jinyang asked again: "I heard that surgery can be done now, can't it?"
　　 "Surgery? It's all unreliable. If there is no other way, can I look for medicine everywhere?"
　　 Wang Jinyang said to He Lingyue again: "By the way, sister, don't you know what your name is?"
　　 He Lingyue was taken aback and said: "My name is..."
　　 "Hahaha, I found it, you guys were here."
　　 Wang Jinyang immediately looked at the sound source alertly, his eyebrows wrinkled at this sight.
　　 "Why are you? You don't want to live anymore?"
　　The people here are Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren.
　　 Liu Ziyang said, "I don't want to live? I think you don't want to live anymore. Yesterday you asked Xiao Qing for information, I knew you would have a deal. I didn't expect to have a baby. Now I'm going to put you in a pot."
　　Wang Jinyang smiled and said, "I said, why did you think you two were weird yesterday, so you were waiting for me here?"
　　 Mo Xiu said angrily to Wang Jinyang: "Brother, you actually investigated me?"
　　Wang Jinyang said indifferently: "Of course I have to investigate such a big business. Don't take it offense. I will deal with these two people first."
　　 Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren had already attacked at this time.
　　 This was planned for the meeting. In order to prevent Wang Jinyang from escaping with concealment skills, Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren disguised as spoilers.
　　 Liu Ziyang used his skills to deceive Wang Jinyang's skills as much as possible, and the others pretended to fight in a melee, ready to encircle at any time to ensure nothing is lost.
　　 Liu Ziyang went to Wang Jinyang directly, and Hao Ren dragged Mo Xiu and He Lingyue alone.
　　 Wang Jinyang said with disdain: "Fatty, if I guess right, you just went to college? You have at most two skills, but brother has four skills."
　　 Liu Ziyang also said not to be outdone: "Hahaha, if you have more skills, you must be strong? Today I will show you the gap in talent."
　　 Liu Ziyang took out a dagger and attacked directly. Wang Jinyang didn't care about it and directly used a skill Extreme Sword.
　　An energy body long sword appeared out of thin air in Wang Jinyang's hands, and his combat power surged. With just two swords, Liu Ziyang's fight was defeated steadily.
　　 played another two tricks, Wang Jinyang said: "Why don't you use skills? Let me see your talent?"
　　 Liu Ziyang smiled and said, "Okay!"
　　 A sword struck Liu Ziyang. Just when Wang Jinyang felt that the battle was over, Liu Ziyang disappeared out of thin air, leaving a shadow in the same place.
　　Wang Jinyang didn't panic. He turned around with a sword, which happened to hit Liu Ziyang's dagger who had just appeared behind Wang Jinyang.
　　 This time ~www.mtlnovel.com~ Wang Jinyang, who has always had the upper hand, was shaken back by two steps.
　　 Liu Ziyang said: "I didn't expect your reaction to be quite fast, come again!"
　　 The battle continued, Wang Jinyang obviously felt that Liu Ziyang's speed had become faster, and he used the advantage of speed to deal with him.
　　Wang Jinyang didn't want to drag it any longer, so he directly used the second skill to explode.
　　The power and movement of the explosion are not small. What Wang Jinyang did not expect was that Liu Ziyang disappeared again, leaving behind an afterimage.
　　Wang Jinyang gritted his teeth, this fat man is so difficult.
　　 Liu Ziyang appeared behind Wang Jinyang again, and was seen through by Wang Jinyang.
　　 The two entered a stalemate for a while.
　　 While Mo Xiuzheng and Hao Ren fought back and forth and refused to give in to each other, they have been observing the movements of Liu Ziyang and Wang Jinyang, ready to support.
　　 He Lingyue was supporting him on the surface, helping Mo Xiu a little while helping Wang Jinyang a little later. In fact, he always kept the distance between himself and Wang Jinyang within three meters.
　　 It was not anyone present who broke the deadlock, but Dong Fang who drove over.
　　 Dong Fang got off the car and went straight to the battle. The first to support was Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu and Dong Fang shot together and quickly forced Hao Ren back. Hao Ren saw that the situation was not good and ran to Liu Ziyang's side.
　　 Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren joined together and attacked Wang Jinyang together. Wang Jinyang looked at Mo Xiu and others, who were coming towards him.
　　 It's a pity that Wang Jinyang failed to insist on waiting to support him. He was forced into a desperate situation and could only use invisibility.
　　 At the same time, the five strongest associations have formed an encirclement.
　　 Liu Ziyang and Hao Ren are in the front, He Lingyue is on the left, and Dong Fang is on the right.
　　 If nothing happens, Wang Jinyang will stay away from the enemy, run backwards, and meet the strongest Moxiu!
　　

    
   


　　 Wang Jinyang turned on the four skills to stealth, and no trace was seen.
　　 Mo Xiu and the others all looked at He Lingyue. If nothing happens, Wang Jinyang will decide where to go next before he becomes invisible.
　　 And He Lingyue had just been within three meters of Wang Jinyang, and he should have predicted the direction of Wang Jinyang's escape.
　　 Mo Xiu waited for it, because the most likely thing is to come to his side.
　　 But He Lingyue pointed in a direction that no one had thought of, the gap between Dong Fang and Liu Ziyang.
　　 Dong Fang and Mo Xiu reacted the fastest, Dong Fang directly used the skill golden body to block in that position.
　　 Mo Xiu launched the Descend of the Valkyrie and rushed in that direction.
　　 "Boom!" Something hit Dong Fang. It seemed that the time was just right when Wang Jinyang hit Dong Fang.
　　 At this time, everyone reacted and immediately narrowed the encirclement net, leaving Wang Jinyang with nowhere to go.
　　 Mo Xiu put his right hand out, and because of the small space, he grabbed Wang Jinyang's arm.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Wang Jinyang, when did you find out?"
　　Wang Jinyang did not run in the direction of Mo Xiu, which is enough to show that he has discovered the clues and does not want to continue trading, but wants to get out immediately.
　　 This scene is quite weird, when Mo Xiu spoke into the air, another voice appeared out of thin air.
　　 "From your little girlfriend can't tell her name, after the battle, you didn't use any skills at all. I was sure at the time that I was in the trap."
　　 He Lingyue lowered her head in embarrassment. She did not expect that Wang Jinyang would suddenly ask for her name. There was a pause at that time.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "It seems that we are still negligent, but now you have been caught, show your true body."
　　 "It's okay to show me my real body, I have two questions I want to ask."
 "what?"
　　 "With the strength of the five of you, why don't you just catch me? Why do you want to act in this drama?"
　　 "Make sure you are foolproof. There are several chances of arrest during this period, but you are too cautious."
　　 "Don't you know my skills? Who made you catch me?"
　　 Mo Xiu realized that Wang Jinyang's question was not out of unwillingness at all.
　　 This is still testing, testing whether his skills are exposed, testing who wants to catch him.
　　 Mo Xiu did not answer, but said solemnly: "Hurry up and show your true body, or you will be rude to you!"
　　 Mo Xiu tried **** his hands, and Wang Jinyang immediately cried out in pain.
　　 "Ah! Ah! Boy, I remember you, we will calculate our account later!"
　　 Without warning, Mo Xiu's hand loosened, and Wang Jinyang suddenly broke free from Mo Xiu's hand and ran into Dong Fang again.
　　 But this time he directly knocked Dong Fang down, Mo Xiu cried out badly, this is Wang Jinyang's three-skill shining stab, invincible when he rushes in.
　　 To be careless, Mo Xiu was restricted by his own fixed thinking. He originally thought that after Wang Jinyang used his invisibility, he would immediately use a stab to get out.
　　 I didn't expect Wang Jinyang to be so cunning. He deliberately waited for the five people to shrink before using the stab, so that he could directly break through the encirclement.
　　 Mo Xiu knew that it might not be too late to catch up at this time, so he had an idea and reacted immediately.
　　 Mo Xiu took a step forward in the direction of Wang Jinyang's escape. At this time, Dong Fang, who was getting up, was pushed to the ground again by Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu just like that, pressing his left hand on Dong Fang's body, taking out Hei Lin with his right hand, aiming at Wang Jinyang's direction, and firmly holding the handle of the knife.
　　 Hei Lin stretched out instantly under the force, Mo Xiu may not be able to catch up with Wang Jinyang, but Hei Lin can definitely!
　　 "Puff!"
　　 Hei Lin penetrated Wang Jinyang. Mo Xiu is probably Wang Jinyang's abdomen. This is the first time Hei Lin has seen blood.
　　 Liu Ziyang and others were shocked by this scene, a dagger that can pop out like a bullet?
　　The most shocking thing was He Lingyue. When Mo Xiu bought the scabbard, she looked at it most carefully. At the time, she thought it was an ordinary dagger, but she didn't expect it to be so magical.
　　 Mo Xiu saw a few people stunned in place, and said helplessly: "What are you doing? Go and grab Wang Jinyang."
　　 After a few people reacted, it should be because of being too weak, Wang Jinyang had slowly revealed his body.
　　 Mo Xiu took back Heilin, and walked forward to check.
　　 Wang Jinyang lay down on the ground, looking pale at Mo Xiu.
　　 said weakly: "You won..."
　　 Mo Xiu said, "I still lost in the layout, and almost let you run away."
　　 Wang Jinyang suddenly laughed madly, completely ignoring his injuries.
　　 "Hahaha, if you have more cards than me, you will win, layout? There is no perfect layout in this world, only perfect breakers!"
　　 Mo Xiu didn't answer Wang Jinyang because he didn't know how to answer.
　　 Wang Jinyang should have passed out because of excessive blood loss.
　　 Mo Xiu began to arrange work.
　　 "Hao Ren, Dong Fang, you two help him stop the bleeding, and then carry it to the car, Liu Ziyang, please contact the law enforcement team."
　　 The three people got busy when they received the order. He Lingyue leaned in at this time and asked: "Then what about me? What should I do?"
　　 Mo Xiu picked up the box on the ground and said, "Please discuss with me, what should I do with this Spirit Gathering Grass?"
　　 He Lingyue said with a smile: "What do you want? Turn in or keep it for yourself?"
　　 "I tend to stay, and there won't be many rewards for handing in."
　　 He Lingyue said, "What else to discuss? I agree with you."
　　 Mo Xiu said with embarrassment, "I mean, how should this be divided?"
　　 "How do you want to divide?"
　　 "I want this grass!"
　　 He Lingyue thought for a while and said, "You are the commander-in-chief of this mission and the one who contributed the most. I have no opinion. You can ask other people."
Mo Xiu saw that the other three people were busy, and shook his head and said, "Let’s talk about it when things are done~www.mtlnovel.com~ Mo Xiu walked to the car, and He Lingyue chased up and asked in a low voice: "Mo Xiu, how are you? Knowing that Wang Jinyang would be invisible. "
　　Mo rested for a while, then turned to look at He Lingyue and said, "Wang Jinyang will be invisible. Isn't it the worst case we discussed at the meeting?"
　　 He Lingyue looked at Mo Xiu with a deep meaning, and then she spoke for a while.
　　 "All the plans are going to be invisible to Wang Jinyang. You are so rigorous, wouldn't you fail to consider other circumstances?"
　　 Mo Xiu patted his thigh and said, "Oh, I really didn't think about it, look! This is where I am short of."
　　 He Lingyue asked, "Also, how can you be sure that with Liu Ziyang's skills, you can entangle Wang Jinyang alone? You are not the kind of person who does not care about the safety of your teammates?"
　　 After hearing He Lingyue's words, Mo Xiu's expression was painful, and he almost shed tears.
　　 "This is indeed my mistake. I didn't take this into consideration. I only considered that Liu Ziyang could flash in two stages."
He Lingyue continued to speak, and Mo Xiu rushed to say: "There is also...the last mistake just now, which caused Wang Jinyang to almost run away. Hey! This time the mission revealed so many shortcomings of me, next time you Come and command!"
　　 He Lingyue was blinded by Mo Xiu, and pointed to her nose and said: "Me?? What am I commanding? I want to ask..."
　　 Mo Xiu interrupted again and said: "It seems that I am not a commander. You see more comprehensively than me. Next time you come to command and try, maybe there will be better results."
　　 "I don't want it, I..."
　　 "Okay, go back! Go back! Give Wang Jinyang to the law enforcement team, we will divide the money..."
　　 Mo Xiu said as he walked away, leaving He Lingyue alone, stomping his feet angrily.
　　 "Huh! Movie King Mo!!!"
　　 
       
 
           


　　 Early the next morning, several people returned to school after handing Wang Jinyang to the law enforcement team.
　　 didn't go back to the bedroom, but went straight to the activity room of the strongest club.
　　 The task has been completed, and the reward has been credited to Mo Xiu's account. Mo Xiu will allocate it according to the previously discussed distribution method.
　　 After that, he took out the lingcao and a big pocket and put it on the table.
　　 Mo Xiu said to everyone: "This is the trophies seized this time. It is stated in the mission that you can get extra rewards if you hand them in. If you don't hand them in, these are our rewards. Now vote and choose to hand them up."
　　 Only Dong Fang raised his hand, everyone looked at him in surprise.
　　 Dong Fang saw the eyes of several people wrong, and asked: "Why are you looking at me like this? Of course, the money Wang Jinyang robbed from the bank must be returned to the bank. We still have rewards."
Liu Ziyang helped explain: "Big brother, you made a mistake. We took the shadow mission, and the one handed in was also the shadow. You have to know that the shadow is a relatively independent supervision department. When things arrive in the shadow, it is basically not. It will be returned."
　　 He Lingyue added: "That's right, so there is no clear description on the task, what to do after finding the Spirit Gathering Grass."
　　 Dong Fang thought for a while before he figured it out.
　　 "I see, what you mean is that although this thing is stolen, it was already legal when we got it. When the law enforcement team handed over the task to Shadow, it didn't want to retrieve the lost thing, right?"
　　 Several people, including Mo Xiu, were a little surprised. Dong Fang actually used his brain. Not only did he use his brain, but he also thought very clearly.
　　 Mo Xiu said, "Yes, the choice now is whether to change the reward or not."
　　 Hao Ren asked: "I don't have any idea yet. Will the rewards exchanged after the handover be greater than the current value of these things?"
　　 Liu Ziyang curled his lips and said: "According to the usual style of the shadow, it is difficult!"
　　 Dong Fang and Hao Ren said together: "Of course it is not handed in."
　　 Mo Xiu said, "Okay, since it's not handed in, let's discuss the distribution. Let me talk about it first. I really want this herb."
　　 Liu Ziyang had weird eyes and smiled and said, "Boss, this time and the last time, you said that there was a problem with that aspect of you. Isn't it... you really have this disease?"
　　 When these words came out, Hao Ren and Dong Fang looked at Mo Xiu weirdly, even He Lingyue secretly watched.
　　 made Mo Xiu very embarrassed, and quickly explained: "Don't talk nonsense, there are no things, both times are task needs."
　　 Hao Ren said grandiosely: "It's okay, it doesn't matter if you are sick or not, the boss has spoken, and the Spirit Gathering Grass belongs to you, I have no opinion."
　　 Liu Ziyang also said: "Ah, yes, boss, I have no opinion, how about you? Dong Fang!"
　　 Dong Fang immediately shook his head, and He Lingyue looked at Mo Xiu with some sympathy and said, "I have never had any opinion, Mo Xiu, the Spirit Gathering Grass belongs to you."
　　 The situation was out of control, and even if Mo Xiu explained it now, it would be useless, so he could only stare at Liu Ziyang fiercely.
　　 Liu Ziyang saw that the situation was not good, so he got up and left.
　　 "Um, boss, I will have a class match in a while, I'm leaving now."
　　 Seeing that Liu Ziyang was about to leave, the others wanted to leave, lest Mo Xiu was embarrassed.
　　 Mo Xiu said helplessly: "Wait a minute, it's not finished yet."
　　The four of them all stopped and looked at Mo Xiu, why didn't they finish dividing? Didn't you just seize a Spirit Gathering Grass this time?
Mo Xiu pointed to the bag on the table and said: "Before handing Wang Jinyang to the law enforcement team, I searched his things and found a key, the key of Fanjie Hotel. When you are busy, I will go alone. I went to the hotel and got this bag back."
　　 No one is stupid, Wang Jinyang hid the bag in the hotel, what else can it be if it is not money?
　　 A few people leaned over and looked at Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu opened the bag, which was filled with hundred yuan bills. You don't need to count it. There should be several million.
　　 Mo Xiu continued: "I took the Spirit Gathering Grass. I don't want you to divide the money. In addition, I still have some deposits, and I paid 2 million to each of your accounts."
　　 After hearing Mo Xiu say this, the few people were not polite, and began to count them, preparing to divide them.
　　 Mo Xiu is not very generous, because the value of the Spirit Gathering Grass is too high. Wang Jinyang's asking price is 100 million, which is definitely not very high. The market price is almost at this price. Even in the black market, it will not be less than 80 million.
　　 Mo Xiu gave two million to each person, a total of eight million, plus his own small share, only spent more than 10 million to buy this herb.
　　 I'm afraid I can't buy this price anywhere, but Mo Xiu actually took a big advantage.
　　 After a while, the money was distributed, and everyone left happily.
　　 Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang went to participate in the class match, and He Lingyue went back to the dormitory to rest. After all, they had been staying up all night for the past three days and didn't have a good rest.
　　 Dong Fang and Mo Xiu are the only two people left. Dong Fang’s family is already difficult, and it may be even more difficult than Mo Xiu used to be. It is a bit excited to make so much money this time.
　　 "Mo Xiu, what shall we do now?"
　　 Mo Xiu thought for a while and said, "Let’s go back and rest too. Let’s sleep first and see if there are any new tasks in the evening."
　　 When Dong Fang heard that there was a new task, his eyes lighted up and he nodded.
　　 The two went to the bank first. Dong Fang couldn't wait to deposit the money and call his mother.
　　 Looking at Dong Fang, Mo Xiu thought of his mother Li Yuan.
　　I have been here for so many days. I haven't called my mother yet. Only when I first arrived at school, I reported that I was safe.
　　 While waiting for Dong Fang, Mo Xiu called Li Yuan.
　　 My mother was still so easy-going, she missed herself a lot, but she didn't express it.
　　 My mother is going to work these days, everything is going in a good direction.
　　 Mo Xiu hung up and checked his balance, only less than one million left.
　　 During this period of time, the expenses were relatively high, buying a house plus the 8 million just given, and leaving a million for my mother when I left Shuncheng. UU reading www. uukanshu.com
　　 Now it can be said that before the liberation one night, there is not much money left, and it seems that I have to take a few more tasks to make some money.
　　 Dong Fang also saved his money at this time, but the big man actually cried.
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "What's the matter?"
Dong Fang cried and said: "Just gave me... Mom... phoned, my mother said that I'm...promising, I can make money, and my family doesn't have to live hard... I cried, and I cried too."
　　 Mo Xiu could understand Dong Fang's mood and comforted Dong Fang all the way back to the bedroom.
　　 As soon as he returned to the room, Mo Xiu fell asleep. These three days were very exhausting, and both physically and mentally, he needed a good rest.
　　 Until the evening, Mo Xiu was woken up by the phone ringing.
  "Hey?"
　　 "Mo Xiu, what's wrong with you? Is it serious?"
　　 "Zheng Yi? What's wrong with me?"
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at the time, only after five o'clock in the afternoon.
　　 "Don't tell me the truth, just tell me what you want."
　　 "Okay, I'm tired of going to bed first, I'm fine, bye bye!"
　　 "Mo Xiu! Mo Xiu..."
　　 Mo Xiu hung up the phone and wanted to stay asleep, but the phone rang again.
　　 Mo Xiu answered the phone and said, "I said I'm fine, are you annoying?"
　　 "Mo Xiu? Are you annoying me?"
　　 Hearing this voice, Mo Xiu immediately became sober, and glanced at the phone, it was Mu Qingyi.
　　 "Ah, Qingyi? I thought it was Zheng Yi, what's the matter? Suddenly called."
　　 There was a long silence on the other end of the phone, and then he asked Mo Xiu a shocked sentence.
　　 "Mo Xiu, are you really sick in that aspect?"
　　 Mo Xiu reacted for one second.
  "what???"
　　


    
   


 "what?!"
　　 Mu Qingyi said: "What's wrong? What happened?"
　　 "Qingyi, who do you listen to nonsense? Nothing."
　　 "Liu Ziyang's circle of friends, is it really okay?"
　　 Mo Xiu promised: "Of course it's okay, Liu Ziyang is talking nonsense, I have to talk to him."
　　 "Haha, okay, it's okay."
　　 Mo Xiu asked a little weirdly: "Qing Yi, do you care about this issue?"
　　 "Why, I'm afraid you are sick, so I called to ask you. If you make fun of me like this, I won't ask anymore."
 "Is it really?"
　　 "Okay... I have something on my side, bye bye!"
　　 Mu Qingyi quickly hung up the phone, and Mo Xiu smirked looking at the phone.
　　 was disturbed by a series of phone calls, and Mo Xiu was no longer sleepy.
　　 Thinking of Mu Qingyi's words just now, I turned to the circle of friends.
　　 Liu Ziyang: The boss really has that kind of illness, hey, pray that the boss can be cured.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't fight out, this Liu Ziyang not only spread rumors, but also sent a circle of friends to inform the world.
　　 Even Mo Xiu couldn't bear it, so he called Liu Ziyang.
　　 "Hello? Boss, what's the matter? There is a new task?"
　　 "It's nothing, just talk to you, see you in the martial arts training ground on the 5th."
　　 "Huh? Now?"
　　 "Right now!"
　　 Mo Xiu hung up the phone, Liu Ziyang was a little puzzled, let’s talk? Martial arts ground number five?
　　 When Liu Ziyang arrived at the training ground, he found that Mo Xiu had been waiting here long ago.
　　 "Boss, what are you looking for me to talk about? Why are you still here?"
　　 Mo Xiu said blankly: "Go, I'll open the martial arts private room, let's go in and talk."
　　 Mo Xiu walked directly in front of him, and Liu Ziyang followed in confusion.
　　 Liu Ziyang didn't realize that it was wrong until Mo Xiu locked the door of the room.
　　 "Boss, what are you doing?"
　　 Mo Xiu said with a ‘kind smile’ on his face, “It’s nothing, we two haven’t discussed each other for a long time, right? This time the new account and the old account are together...No, you and my skills have been upgraded, so we should compare them.”
　　 Liu Ziyang swallowed, and took a step back and said, "Boss, there is no need to learn from each other. I can't beat you, can't I give up?"
　　 "You're wrong, have you forgotten the first lesson that Teacher Wang Lei taught us? We are not afraid of strong enemies. We learn from each other when we learn from each other. Where did you admit defeat?"
　　 Liu Ziyang still wanted to continue to decline, but Mo Xiu did not give him this opportunity, and directly launched the descent of the **** of war to rush towards Liu Ziyang.
　　 rushed to a halt suddenly, and Liu Ziyang was very nervous.
　　 Mo Xiu paused and said, "You prefer to use daggers, shall we try to bring or not bring weapons?"
　　 Liu Ziyang shook his head in fright as the terrifying black lin piercing Wang Jinyang appeared in his mind.
　　 "Oh, well, let's get started."
　　 Mo Xiu, under the blessing of the coming of the Valkyrie, is very fast, even Liu Ziyang, who is known for his speed, can't match it.
　　 came in front of Liu Ziyang in an instant, and banged at the door with a punch. Liu Ziyang could only use the skill to avoid afterimage.
　　 Liu Ziyang did not appear behind Mo Xiu, but appeared in the distance. It was not that Liu Ziyang didn't want to attack, but he had learned Mo Xiu's inhuman reaction speed. If he attacked, he would definitely be beaten badly.
　　 Liu Ziyang appeared and said: "Boss, are you really here?"
　　 Mo Xiu did not reply, and continued to attack.
　　 Liu Ziyang, who got the skill bonus, was also much faster, and he had room to deal with Mo Xiu.
　　 But there are only two tricks, how terrifying is Mo Xiu's actual combat? That's even Wang Lei's a little jealous.
　　 Liu Ziyang is an assassin, an assassin and a warrior fighting hand-to-hand, and even the speed is not superior, there is no way to fight.
　　 The third move forced Liu Ziyang's second skill. This time Liu Ziyang appeared on the side close to the door.
　　 That's right! Liu Ziyang didn't want to engage in this unfair ‘discussion’, he wanted to escape.
　　 But how could Mo Xiu give him this opportunity? It was a punch to catch up with Liu Ziyang soon.
　　 Liu Ziyang was beaten awkwardly, and then he faced Mo Xiu's stormy fists.
　　 "Boss, I gave up?"
　　 "What? Do you still want to fight? Good!"
　　 "No! I said I gave up!"
　　 "Huh? Do you want to continue? Okay!"
　　 Five minutes later, Liu Ziyang lay on the ground with his head in his hands, Mo Xiu stood aside with his arms crossed.
　　 Liu Ziyang said weakly: "Boss, just tell me, how can I offend you?"
　　 "Stop telling me about my illness anymore, have you heard?"
　　 Liu Ziyang raised three fingers and said: "I, Liu Ziyang, swear, I will help the boss to keep a secret."
　　 Mo Xiu's face turned black for an instant, what is meant by keeping a secret?
　　 twisted his neck and beaten again.
　　 Liu Ziyang's screams echoed throughout the private room.
　　 "Ah! Boss, I swear, ah! What about me?"
　　......
　　 In the evening, Mo Xiu returned to the bedroom after his activities.
　　 Now whether Liu Ziyang doesn't believe that he is not sick, he won't continue to spread rumors.
　　 Opened Liu Ziyang's circle of friends and found that the circle of friends had been deleted. Mo Xiu smiled satisfied.
　　 The next thing to do is to take the medicine, the precious tree of Spirit Gathering has not been eaten yet.
　　 The value of the Spirit Gathering Grass may not be as good as the Spirit Ring in some people's eyes, but it is too useful for Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu insisted on exercising, but found that his strength and speed had not improved for a long time, as if he had entered a bottleneck.
　　 This problem has plagued Mo Xiu for several days, and it wasn't until he saw the Jiling Grass that he realized it.
　　 Mo Xiu has never eaten any herbs since he was a child, and he can reach his current physical strength by working harder than others.
　　 Effort can determine a person's development speed, and potential is the decisive factor that determines the height of development.
　　 After so many years of hard work, Mo Xiu has used up his own potential, no matter how hard he exercises, it is difficult to go further.
　　 The only way is to increase the physical potential, UU reading www.uukanshu.com to increase the upper limit.
　　Because of the coming of the Valkyrie, the better Mo Xiu's basic base is, the stronger the activation skills will be.
　　 Therefore, this time Mo Xiu will have the power to win the Spirit Gathering Grass.
Mo Xiu searched a lot on the Internet about how to take the Spirit Gathering Grass, and finally came to the conclusion that the main effect of Spirit Gathering Grass is that it contains a lot of energy, which can completely change the physique. The best way is to swallow it whole. Any method of treatment will lose energy.
　　 What's even more exaggerated is that on the Internet, a detailed comparison between swallowing the Spirit Gathering Grass in one bite and eating it in two bites, calculated the energy loss, Mo Xiu couldn't understand it, but he thought it was amazing.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at the fist-sized Spirit Gathering Grass, and its head was big. How could it be swallowed?
　　 After playing with the Spirit Gathering Grass for half an hour, Mo Xiu was heartbroken and grabbed the Spirit Gathering Grass and stuffed it forcefully into his mouth.
　　 Mo Xiu reluctantly pushed the Spirit Gathering Grass into his mouth, feeling that the corners of his mouth would tear.
　　 closed his mouth hard, but found that he couldn't close it anyway, so he had to cover his mouth tightly with his hand.
　　 I chewed hard in my mouth and swallowed it for a while.
　　 Does it taste? It's no different from eating grass, a bitterness comes from my heart to the tip of my tongue.
　　 After a while, I felt a warmth in the abdomen. Mo Xiu sat cross-legged, closed his eyes to feel the warmth, and tried to guide this warmth throughout the body.
　　 This process is very long. When Mo Xiu felt the warmth fade and opened his eyes, it was already nine o'clock the next morning.
　　 After examining the body, there was no change except for the improvement of the skin.
　　 Mo Xiu exclaimed: "The removal of impurities from the body in the novel will excrete a lot of dirt. I also deliberately meditate on the ground for fear of staining the sheets. It seems to be a lie!"
　　

 
       
 
           


　　 Mo Xiu walked out of the room and found that Dong Fang was not there. He didn't know what he was doing.
　　 looked around and found that there was nothing to eat, some were hungry, so they had to go to the cafeteria by themselves.
　　 Coincidentally, I ran into Xiao Hong at the entrance of the cafeteria. Mo Xiu wanted to say hello, but he just raised his right hand to say hello.
　　 Xiao Hong glanced over with a sharp eye, walked quickly past Mo Xiu, and snorted coldly when he walked to Mo Xiu's side.
　　 Mo Xiu's right hand froze for a moment, and after Xiao Hong passed by, he scratched his head awkwardly.
　　 Why is this woman so strong? You can't blame Liu Ziyang and anger yourself, right?
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head and walked into the cafeteria to take a simple bite, and then hurriedly rushed to the No. 5 martial arts training ground.
　　 There are fifteen martial arts training grounds in the entire Yenching University. Mo Xiu loves this number five. For nothing else, this is the cheapest martial arts training ground in the school.
　　 Other venues are different, some are advanced in equipment, and some are similar to the helmet simulation venue during the college entrance examination.
　　 It is said that the best simulation venue can simulate a perfect opponent, and it can also help students improve compared to actual combat, but the price is of course not cheap.
　　 Mo Xiu also wants to see and see, but is the current economic strength...
　　 Entering the No. 5 martial arts training ground, Mo Xiu came to the front desk to rent a private room for physical examination.
　　 In fact, the lobby of each venue is free, but Mo Xiu chose a private room out of low-key and measurement accuracy considerations.
　　 Enter the private room with the key. This private room is the most common. The facilities inside are very simple. There are power-training props, a special treadmill, and an instrument for measuring strength and speed.
　　 Mo Xiu was not in a hurry to take a measurement, first stood on the treadmill and started running.
　　 This is to adapt to the rapidly increasing physical fitness. After the whole body can coordinate and exert its strength, the test can be performed before the real data can be tested.
　　 Mo Xiu first ran at the previous speed, slowly accelerating, getting faster and faster.
　　 has not reached full speed, the treadmill can't keep up with Mo Xiu's speed.
　　 Mo Xiu stepped off the treadmill in disappointment. It seems that if I want to train in the future, I have to rent a better room.
　　 There is no way to push myself out of the limit state, I can only bite the bullet and test.
　　 First is the speed test. Mo Xiu used his full strength this time, and the coordination of the whole body is also good. It should be possible to test more accurate data.
　　4.988s
　　 A hundred meters in less than five seconds, before changing to another, Mo Xiu couldn't even think of it. He didn't expect that a herbal medicine could have such a big improvement.
　　 If this were the case, Mo Xiu knew that there would be a big gap between himself and the true pride of heaven.
　　 The real big family will have endless resources since childhood. They may not care about the college entrance examination results, the university will directly recruit, or they will not go to university at all, and it is better to stay in the family.
　　 Next is the strength test. Mo Xiu focused his whole body power on his fist in accordance with the previous force method.
　　 The strength test is not as smooth as the speed test, and the first force exertion is not complete.
　　425.786kg
　　 Mo Xiu frowned. Compared with the speed, the power is not much improved. Come again!
　　 "Boom!"
　　457.325kg
　　 It's better, but it's not at its best.
　　 "Boom!"
　　487.352kg
　　 Come again!
　　 "Boom! Boom! Boom!"
　　503.254kg
　　 After dozens of hits, his fist strength finally exceeded 500kg, and Mo Xiu smiled in satisfaction.
　　 At this time, the door of the private room was knocked, and a sound came from outside.
　　 "Students inside, don't use too much testing equipment. If you want to train, don’t there be training equipment inside?"
　　 Mo Xiu just reacted, and he has tested it dozens of times.
　　 "Sorry, I forgot it for a while."
　　 did not hear a response, it should be the patrolling person who left after warning.
　　 The improvement this time is great, now with this physical strength, coupled with the coming of the Valkyrie, Mo Xiu is confident that he will be tied with Wang Lei.
　　 After eating Ju Ling Grass, his potential should have also been improved, and he can continue to make progress. This is what Mo Xiu is most happy about.
　　 Mo Xiu originally wanted to continue training, but he gave up after looking at the training equipment in the room. These equipment were not enough to support his training, so he had to give up.
　　 If you want to find a way to make money, the simplest private room like this will cost 1,000 yuan a day.
　　 Mo Xiu walked out of the No. 5 martial arts training ground and went straight back to the dormitory, only to find that Dong Fang had not come back.
　　 took out his mobile phone and started to study the task. When he lay down, he felt that something dangled. After touching what it was, Mo Xiu patted his head, how could he have forgotten about it.
　　 was the pistol bought from the black market. Mo Xiu had never seen a hot weapon. He didn't know how destructive this pistol was, so he decided to give it a try.
　　 Mo Xiu came to the deserted mountain alone, pulled the trigger, "click!" No response?
　　 After researching it, it was still unavailable. Mo Xiu was a little angry. The store was cheating on himself. It was a fake at all. He thought he had discovered something extraordinary.
　　 Throwing to the ground, Mo Xiu's strength was not weak, and the pistol hit the stone, "Kaka!".
　　 Mo Xiu listened to the sound a little strange, picked it up again, and moved his face up to pull the trigger at random.
　　 "Boom!"
　　 The bullet moved across Mo Xiu's face.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at the pistol with lingering fear. Fortunately, he didn't aim at himself just now, otherwise he would die young.
　　After studying for a while, I realized that the pistol needs to be loaded with bullets before it can be used.
　　Mo Xiu still wanted to continue testing the power of the pistol, but he was a little inconvenient. After thinking about it, he still called Dong Fang.
　　 Dong Fang trot all the way to Mo Xiu after going up the mountain.
　　 "Mo Xiu, what's the matter? I woke up in the morning to see if you weren't awake, so I went out to eat with my former classmates."
　　 Mo Xiu handed the pistol to Dong Fang and said, "Remember this?"
　　 "Remember ~ www.mtlnovel.com~ bought it on the black market, what did you say at the time? A heat weapon?"
　　 Mo Xiu stepped back more than ten meters and said, "Come on, hit me!"
　　 "Huh?" Dong Fangmeng got over, what does this mean?
　　 Mo Xiu launched the descent of the **** of war and taught Dong Fang to load it.
　　 "Boss, do you really aim at you? What if you can't avoid it?"
　　 "Don't talk nonsense, hurry up, aim!"
　　 Mo Xiu's attention is highly concentrated, his eyes fixed on the muzzle.
　　 "Boom!"
　　 The bullet flew, Mo Xiu reacted to the limit, and he started to act as soon as he saw the bullet appear.
　　 dodged the bullet, Mo Xiu fell into thought, Dong Fang was stunned.
　　 It took a while for Dong to react and asked, "Mo Xiu, your reaction is so fast? If I can't hide, this thing is too scary."
　　 "I roughly calculated it. I have some spare power for the distance of ten meters just now. Within three meters, if I suddenly release a cold gun, I will definitely be shot without preparation."
　　 "I'll go, or we'll hand him in, it's too dangerous."
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Come on, shoot me again, try the power?"
　　 With the previous test, Dong Fang quickly entered the state this time and fired a shot at Mo Xiu.
　　 After Mo Xiu escaped this time, his right hand slashed towards the bullet.
　　 But the bullet was still too fast after all, wiping Mo Xiu's palm.
　　 Mo Xiu raised his right hand and was injured, although only slightly.
　　 But this is Mo Xiu's defensive power when he activates the skill. It has increased all attributes by 300%, and he will still be injured.
　　 It's a bit scary to think of. When the skill is not activated, an ordinary person can assassinate himself.

　　 An ordinary pistol can have such a lethality, what about other weapons?
　　 Mo Xiu finally understood the real reason why the Alliance banned thermal weapons.
　　 Thermal weapons have limited lethality to beasts, but they pose a great threat to humans.
　　There must be some people who want to use thermal weapons to rule all mankind during the civil strife.
　　 In order to save humans with powerful skills against beasts, the Alliance had to completely ban thermal weapons.
　　 Mo Xiu took the pistol from Dong Fang. Such a weapon may not cause harm to people of warrior physique like himself, but it is very easy to deal with ordinary people, including his mother Li Yuan.
　　 Thinking of this, Mo Xiu can no longer calm down, take out his phone, open the shadow software, choose to create a task, and investigate the hot weapon!
　　Since they decided to investigate this matter, Mo Xiu and Dong Fang returned to the Fanjie black market to investigate.
　　 The results are shocking. Almost every stall owner has hot weapons, the prices are different, and the all-color pistols are exactly the same as the one in Mo Xiu's hand.
　　 When asked about the source, everyone's answers were surprisingly consistent. One night, they picked it up when they entered the black market, and everyone who saw it got a handful.
　　 This matter is not a secret, and Mo Xiu didn't have to work hard to find out where the gun was found.
　　 Mo Xiu and Dong Fang hurriedly came to the place. There was indeed a large cloth bag torn and scattered all over the place, but there was nothing unusual in other places, and this place could not be entered by car.
　　 Mo Xiu said to Dong Fang: "Let's find it separately and pay attention to the surrounding details."
　　 Dong Fang knew that this matter was not trivial, and nodded seriously. "it is good!"
　　 An hour later, the two met again.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "How is it?"
　　 Dong Fang shook his head.
　　 Mo Xiu sighed and said: "Hey, the clues are broken. What the stall owners said is not like a lie, but there are no clues here and there are no traces around. Is it possible that this pistol flew from the sky?
　　 Mo Xiu raised his head and looked at the sky, somehow, the figure of the magic eagle flashed through his mind.
　　 shook his head and said: "How is it possible!"
　　 Dong Fang asked: "Mo Xiu, what did you say? What should we do now?"
　　 "The clue is broken, let's go back first!"
　　 "After a day of tossing today, is this the end of this matter?"
　　 "It won't be over. No matter who puts the gun here, there must be his purpose. Let's wait and see what this person wants to do next!"
　　……
　　 July 16, today is the fifteenth day of school, and it is also the day of the department trial.
　　 In the ten days after the investigation of the thermal weapon failed, Mo Xiu contacted other people in the strongest society to prepare for another task.
　　 Hao Ren and Liu Ziyang are at the critical stage of the class match. They don't want to be affected. They think it's better to wait.
　　 He Lingyue was also unable to follow the mission due to private affairs, and in the end only Mo Xiu and Dong Fang were left.
　　 There are a lot fewer tasks that two people can take, and Mo Xiu is not prepared to force it. These days, he takes a D-level or a less difficult C-level task every day.
　　 After completing the mission, Mo Xiu can still have free time to train.
　　 The past ten days have been very fulfilling, and wealth has also accumulated. All the points go to Mo Xiu, and most of the cash is given to Dong Fang, but Mo Xiu still has more than 4 million in his bank card.
　　 No. 3 martial arts training ground, inside the No. 1 private room.
　　 Mo Xiu and Dong Fang came here early. Today is the day for selection in the department. After half a month, they can finally continue the competition.
　　 It is worth mentioning that, except for Hao Ren, all the five members of the strongest club were selected in the department.
For this reason, Hao Ren was still sad for several days. He did not find Mo Xiu to complain. Mo Xiu was a little annoyed, so he had to give Hao Ren a task to recruit the sixth person from the strongest society. The request was... . A player who advances to the departmental competition.
　　 This requirement greatly increases the difficulty. Generally, such masters have been absorbed by the major organizations. Even if there are some mavericks, why come to the strongest organization with only five people?
　　 Hao Ren knew that it was very difficult, but somehow he did something, so he didn’t bother Mo Xiu any more.
　　Because the venue is very large and there are many people, Mo Xiu and Dong Fang went around for several times before they found He Lingyue and the monitor Mumu.
　　 Mumu hadn't seen Mo Xiu and Dong Fang for a long time, and greeted them enthusiastically.
　　 "You two are here? Ling Yue and I have been looking for you."
　　 Mo Xiu said: "We are also looking for you. The time has come, and the teacher has not arrived. I don't know which teacher is less reliable than our class teacher."
　　 Mu Mumu covered her mouth and smiled and said, "Mo Xiu, didn't you look at the list sticking to the door?"
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head and looked at Dong Fang. Dong Fang still had that simple and honest appearance, spreading his hands and saying that he didn't know.
　　 He Lingyue sighed and said, "The person in charge of the selection in the department is our head teacher Cao Fenglin."
　　 Mo Xiu was taken aback for a moment and said, "No, during the class match, listening to Teacher Cao's tone, he should not be responsible for the selection in the department."
　　 Several people looked at Mu Mu, thinking that the monitor would know something.
　　 Mu Mu said somewhat innocently: "Don't look at me, I am like you. I haven't seen a teacher in half a month."
　　 When several people were talking, a voice came from the door.
　　 "Ahem, everyone is divided into teams according to class, one class stands at the forefront, arranged in order."
　　 With this lazy voice, who else could it be without Cao Fenglin?
　　 Mo Xiu fixed his eyes, Cao Fenglin was holding a big loudspeaker and talking to everyone.
　　 After everyone reacted for a second, the classmates of the first class stood in the forefront, and the others stood in line according to their own class, and soon formed a neat team.
Cao Fenglin said into the loudspeaker: "I was temporarily notified ~www.mtlnovel.com~ to be responsible for this departmental selection. Some people should have heard of the previous departmental selection methods, but this time it is my organization. Do it my way."
　　 Everyone was silent, listening carefully to the rules of the game.
　　 "There is no objection, I will assume that you agree to my rules. My rules are very simple. As the smallest department, the auxiliary department has only 16 classes. Class 1 and Class 16 stand here."
　　 The students in Class 1 and Class 16 heard their names and stood in line where Cao Fenglin pointed.
　　 "Class 2 and Class 15!"
　　 "Class 3 and Class 14!"
　　 "Class 4 and Class 13!"
　　……
　　Mo Xiu is in Class 6, and of course he is assigned to Class 11. To some surprise, all four people in Class 11 are girls.
　　 Just when everyone thought that Cao Fenglin would let everyone fight in groups, Cao Fenglin did not disappoint Mo Xiu, his words were amazing, and the game method was random and scary.
　　 "The Auxiliary Department selected a total of four shortlisted students and two groups of five-member teams to advance."
　　 "Now there are groups of eight people, one and sixteen are in a single elimination round, and so on. You decide who you want to play against. If you can't decide, you can guess the punch."
"Eliminate four people, and the remaining four will become the new team. Tomorrow, the new team and the new team 8 will be singled out. The rules are the same. Choose your opponent. The day after tomorrow, the new team and the new team will face off. The day after tomorrow is the new team. Xinxin First Class and Xinxinxin Second Class face off. In the end, there is one class with four players who advance to the heads-up match. The four players face off again in twos to decide one or two. One or two winners will choose themselves among everyone. Teammates, form two teams for promotion, do you understand?"
　　 Everyone was dumbfounded, this... is simply perfunctory!

　　 "Did you not hear what I said? I asked if you understand?"
　　 Cao Fenglin finally raised the volume a little, and everyone was refreshed.
　　 "Understand!"
　　 "Well, if you understand, stop the ink, start the game, start from the first group!"
　　 The first group consists of people from Class 1 and Class 16. Eight people are a little confused when they come to the center of the venue. Whoever is singled out has to choose by themselves. How to choose?
　　 It's been half a month since school started. Everyone knows who is stronger. At this time, no one wants to match the strongest, and they are in the middle of the field for a while.
Cao Fenglin's patience is limited. After waiting for ten minutes, eight people still didn't respond. They raised their horns and said: "Groups according to where they are standing now. The two facing each other form a group. The first group starts with the stupid kid! "
　　 The two groups stood face to face, and according to what Cao Fenglin said, they were indeed divided directly into groups.
　　 The first group started the game. Both of them are booster skills, and they are relatively close in strength. They played against each other for a long time without a winner.
　　 In the end, one of the classmates' skills had cooled down, and the other took the opportunity to attack and decide the winner.
　　 This game lasted for nearly twenty minutes, and Cao Fenglin was obviously a little impatient.
　　 said after the end of the game: "Everyone gives way to the field, and the remaining three pairs play together. The next game is also the four groups of two teams at the same time."
　　 The morning passed quickly. Whether it is a game or a game, it will not be boring.
　　 Four groups of duels were held at the same time, and the progress of the competition was much faster. Eight classes participated in the competition in the morning, and the sixth class where Mo Xiu was in should be able to compete in the afternoon.
　　 Mo Xiu and a few people came to the cafeteria for dinner at noon.
　　 Mumu asked curiously: "Mo Xiu, what is the name of the club you formed? How is its development? How many people are there? I was admitted to the Vermilion Club, otherwise I would definitely join."
　　 It can be seen that Mu Mu is a little guilty, and the same class has been promoted to the trial in the department. She is the only one who has not joined Mo Xiu's club.
　　 Without waiting for Mo Xiu to speak, Dong Fang said first: "Hey, our strongest society, when it was founded, there were five people, but now it's still five people!"
　　 Mumu asked suspiciously: "The strongest society? Are you so confident? But I asked for the name!"
　　 Dong Fang and He Lingyue looked at Mo Xiu together, wanting Mo Xiu to explain.
　　 Mo Xiu spread his hands and said: "The name of the club is called the strongest club, and the number is 666. You can check it!"
Mu Mu was a little stunned, seeing that Mo Xiu was a very low-key person. He was one of the best in the auxiliary department. He was very famous in the department, but he had never seen Mo Xiu publicize himself. How could he have such a hateful name? .
　　 Mu Mu said awkwardly, "Ah, the strongest club? It sounds nice."
　　 He Lingyue could see that Mu Mu was concealing his embarrassment, biting his scalp to praise it.
　　 "Mumu, it's okay, laugh as long as you want, we can't help it, it's already the name anyway."
　　 Mumu was already hearty, watching He Lingyue say this, then looking at Mo Xiu and Dong Fang who were smiling but not smiling, and smiled heartily.
　　 "Hahaha, Mo Xiu, why did you come up with such a name?"
　　 "Strength does not allow me to keep a low profile."
　　 Several people spent their lunch break talking and laughing.
　　 Back to the No. 3 martial arts training room in the No. 1 private room, preparing for the afternoon game.
　　 Ranked in front of Moxiu Class 6 is a duel between Class 5 and Class 12.
　　 The strength of Class 5 is extremely strong. Three students won by an overwhelming advantage, and the other encountered the strongest of Class 12, and was defeated after half an hour of fierce battle.
　　 "The next group, Class 6 and Class 11, hurry in and pick your opponents!"
　　 Cao Fenglin sat in a chair and said impatiently with one hand on his cheek.
　　 Eight people enter, class 11 is all girls, and class six has two boys, Mo Xiu and Dong Fang.
　　 Mo Xiu is a standard figure of 1.8 meters, which is more conspicuous among the eight people.
　　 Not to mention Dong Fang, compared with Mo Xiu, it is a crush, let alone compared with a girl.
　　 feels like a bully on the sixth side.
Seeing that there was no one speaking, Mo Xiu was afraid that Cao Fenglin would make arrangements for the match again, so he suggested: "Why are we doing this? Two girls in our class choose opponents, how about the two remaining two in your class choosing us two boys? "
This plan may seem unfair, but since there are no particularly strong people among the four in Class 11, there is no such thing as Mu Mu and He Lingyue choosing the weak ones, so Dong Fang and Mo Xiu can defeat the strong ones. In fact, it is basically Look at luck.
　　 Of course, the four people in Class 6 support Mo Xiu's proposal. After a while, the four girls in Class 11 also nodded and agreed.
　　 Mu Mu was already bold, and He Lingyue was not a procrastinator, and the two quickly chose their opponents.
　　 The remaining two were not disappointed because they were going to play against the boys, but one of them was full of excitement in their eyes.
　　 Mo Xiu took a closer look. This girl is very small, her height should be around 160, and her figure is well-proportioned, which means she often trains.
　　It was the turn of the remaining two women in Class 11 to choose their opponents. After they looked at each other, the small girl pointed to Mo Xiu and said, "Mo Xiu! I know you are great, I want to challenge you!"
　　 The audience was shocked when he said this. Although Mo Xiu was low-key, he couldn't hide his identity as the top student in the college entrance examination.
　　 The whole department knows that there is a boy named Mo Xiu, who is a strong offensive skill but reported to the auxiliary department. Everyone avoided it. Unexpectedly, this little girl dared to challenge Mo Xiu.
　　 You must know that the competition mechanism of Yenching University is very complete. What kind of results are obtained after the end of each academic year will be recorded in the archives. When graduation, major companies and departments will consider whether to hire or not based on the results.
　　 Just promoted to the top ten in the department selection and department selection. It is a completely different treatment. No one wants to waste this opportunity and wants to get as high as possible.
　　 And this girl, took the risk and chose Mo Xiu. UU reading www.uukａnshu.com
　　 Mo Xiu narrowed his eyes, and couldn't figure out why this girl chose to choose herself. Is it because she has a very good relationship with the girl next to her, and she doesn't want her friend to face a strong enemy? It doesn't look like it.
　　 Cao Fenglin smiled playfully, picked up the horn and said, "Okay, the division is over, and the game begins!"
　　 The four groups came to their respective venues, the venue is 50 meters square, the rule of victory or defeat is to lose the lap or lose combat effectiveness.
　　 Mo Xiu has known this rule for a long time, and it is a common rule in all major competitions in society.
　　 After entering the field, the other three groups quickly entered the game, but Mo Xiu did not move, because it was obvious that the other party had something to say.
　　 "My name is Yang Qingzhuo, remember my name."
　　 "I will remember, I am curious why you chose to challenge me?"
　　 "You'll know in a while, we'll talk about it after half of the game!"
　　 Mo Xiu smiled and said: "Interesting, then start..."
　　 Mo Xiu was stunned in the middle of what he said. He activated God's spy while he was speaking and was stunned by Yang Qingzhuo's skills.
　　"One skill: Speed ​​3
Skill effect: 800% increase speed for any target, 400% increase speed when used on two targets at the same time, 267% increase speed when used on three targets at the same time, When used on four targets at the same time, the increase is 200%, and at the same time...
　　When using skills, the number of targets for amplification can be adjusted at will.
　　 Duration: Ten minutes
　　Cooling time: 12 hours"
　　Mo Xiu also saw Level 3 skills for the first time.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo is undoubtedly a support, the best support, simply increasing the speed, reaching an astonishing 800%!
　　 Mo Xiu's eyes gradually became serious, knowing that he had encountered a powerful enemy!
　　

    
   


　　 Yang Qingzhuo said, "Shall we start?"
　　 Mo Xiu made a please gesture and said, "Let’s start!"
　　 Let's start with three words, and the two of them activate their skills at the same time. It can be seen that neither of them underestimated each other.
　　 Mo Xiu even took the lead in launching an attack, extremely fast, and appeared in front of Yang Qingzhuo in an instant.
　　 With a punch, it was empty, and Yang Qingzhuo disappeared in place.
　　 Mo Xiu instantly turned around to resist Yang Qingzhuo's sneak attack.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo didn't disappear just now, but the speed was too fast. It was almost impossible for Mo Xiu to see all the movements of Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 Mo Xiu felt a sense of crisis when facing his peers for the first time. This speed is very troublesome. If Yang Qingzhuo can break through his own defenses, then this will be a hard fight.
　　 Mo Xiu is a little bit lucky at this time. The use of weapons in Yanjing University is not allowed. If Yang Qingzhuo had a sharp dagger in his hands at this time, it would be even more powerful.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo fought very aggressively, wrapped around Mo Xiu, waiting for opportunities, from time to time, he quickly attacked two punches, did not love fighting, and withdrew after the fight.
　　 Mo Xiu is annoying, Yang Qingzhuo is not only fast, but also very flexible. At this time, she is agile.
　　 Even though Mo Xiu reacted very fast, he couldn't hit Yang Qingzhuo, with a small body, agile feet, and clever dodge.
　　 Mo Xiu deliberately leaked flaws to lure Yang Qingzhuo many times, but Yang Qingzhuo was very smart and never fooled.
　　 Fortunately, Yang Qingzhuo has a fatal weakness, that is, his offensive power is insufficient and he cannot break through Mo Xiu's extremely strong defense power.
　　 If you continue to fight like this, you can only wait until the skill cooldown is over before you can decide the winner.
　　 Mo Xiu knows that Yang Qingzhuo's skills last for ten minutes. The skills used by two people at the same time mean that they will enter the cooling time at the same time.
　　 In the absence of skills on both sides, Mo Xiu is confident to take down Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 The two continued to fight, Mo Xiu attacked, Yang Qingzhuo all avoided, Yang Qingzhuo attacked, and Mo Xiu blocked all of them.
　　 Mo Xiu's speed is not dominant, but his reaction speed is very strong, and every attack can be blocked.
　　 Although Mo Xiu predicted that Yang Qingzhuo would not be able to break the defense, he still blocked all the offense out of caution.
　　At this time, the other three groups have been divided into winners and losers. The three of Class 6 won and promoted without suspense. Everyone was lamenting the strength of Class 6 and few people noticed Mo Xiu's side.
　　 When the other three games were over, all eyes focused on the match between Mo Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 At this time, everyone was shocked. The game, which was thought to be the least suspenseful, was actually at the end.
　　 When watching the field carefully, everyone was stunned.
　　 Dong Fang, of course, are also paying attention to the game here.
　　 Dong Fang asked He Lingyue: "Where is that girl? Why is there only Mo Xiu on the court."
　　 Mumu also looked at the court curiously. Because Yang Qingzhuo's speed was too fast, most people could only see Mo Xiu doing actions alone, very fast, and there was only a dark shadow beside Mo Xiu.
　　 He Lingyue sighed: "It's too fast, this person's speed is too fast, look at that dark shadow, it's the girl."
　　 When He Lingyue's words came out, everyone was shocked, what? How can someone get this fast?
　　 Dong Fang said stupidly: "Hey, Mo Xiu is amazing."
　　 Mumu said in surprise: "Dong Fang, are you okay, looking at Mo Xiu's current state, he should be on par with that girl."
　　 He Lingyue interjected: "Yes, it is precisely because of this that Mo Xiu is amazing. Mo Xiu's speed is far lower than that of the girl, but Mo Xiu's movements seem to block all attacks."
　　 Mumu was said by He Lingyue, and she looked at Mo Xiu thoughtfully.
　　 The more you see, the weirder Mo Xiu's movements become. His body hardly moves. At a certain moment, he suddenly makes a strange movement. It seems that he is really resisting the attack, but how is this possible? How could it be possible to block an afterimage attack?
　　 Mo Xiu in the field gradually became familiar with Yang Qingzhuo's rhythm, slowly counterattacks began to increase, and almost hit Yang Qingzhuo several times.
　　 Mo Xiu's eyes have also changed from being serious at the beginning to excitement. This is a good opportunity to exercise. It is not easy to meet opponents who are much faster than himself.
　　 Mo Xiu punched again, this time it hit Yang Qingzhuo, but was blocked by the opponent.
　　 Calculate the time a bit, the skill still has two or three minutes to cool down, Mo Xiu couldn't help but feel a little pity, if the time is longer, Yang Qingzhuo should be caught.
　　 At this moment, Yang Qingzhuo suddenly stopped running and stood in place, and the others saw the dark shadow disappear and Yang Qingzhuo appeared.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo's expression also changed, no longer full of confidence at the beginning, but a hint of joy between his brows.
　　 Mo Xiu looked stunned, why is this person so strange? I'm happy when I'm about to lose.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't take the opportunity to attack, but stood still, wanting to see what Yang Qingzhuo wanted to do?
　　 Yang Qingzhuo stretched his brows, and a bright smile appeared on his face.
　　 "I didn't choose the wrong one!"
　　 Mo Xiu raised his eyebrows, not understanding what Yang Qingzhuo meant.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo walked in front of Mo Xiu step by step, the distance between the two was less than one meter.
　　 whispered: "Come and feel my skills, let's continue talking!"
　　Mo Xiu was still thinking about the meaning of Yang Qingzhuo's words. Suddenly, a blue light flashed under his feet, and Mo Xiu felt that his whole person had become lighter.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo’s skill effect can increase the number of augmentation targets at any time, which means that Yang Qingzhuo used the skill on Mo Xiu, and the speed increased by 400% for two targets.
　　 Mo Xiu was still feeling the state of his body, and Yang Qingzhuo punched him over.
　　 Mo Xiu flashed away slightly, and actually avoided the distance of five or six meters directly. This increase is too obvious, right?
　　Looking at the figure of Yang Qingzhuo attacking~www.mtlnovel.com~ Mo Xiu finally understood, why Yang Qingzhuo had to challenge himself and why he was so confident.
　　 Because Yang Qingzhuo's purpose is not to defeat Mo Xiu, but to join Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu stood still, Yang Qingzhuo approached! Punch! He hit Mo Xiu's abdomen, and stopped at the moment he immediately hit.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo closed his fists and stood up straight and said, "Why don't you hide?"
　　 "Because you won't let me lose, you don't want me to lose, you want me to keep winning."
　　 Yang Qingzhuo smiled again, with a small body and delicate face, he smiled quite cutely.
　　 naughty stretched out his tongue and said: "It seems that you not only have a talent for fighting, I chose the right one!"
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Yang Qingzhuo and said, "I'm glad you chose me."
　　 Yang Qingzhuo stretched out the little finger of his right hand and said, "That's it!"
　　 Moxiu laughed, this woman was so naive, she wanted to pull the hook.
　　 No matter what he thought, Mo Xiu stretched out his little finger and hooked Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 Cao Fenglin looked at this scene a little disappointed, raised his loudspeaker and shouted: "Are you two talking about love here? Why? Is it a tie?"
　　 The scene that appeared on the field was very strange.
　　 Mo Xiu smiled and pointed to Yang Qingzhuo and said, "No, teacher, she gave up and I won."
 "Ok???"
　　 The audience was shocked, saying that the opponent gave up?
　　 Yang Qingzhuo smiled and said: "Yes! I give up!"
 "what???"
　　 What the hell? What kind of ghost game is this? ? ?
　　 Dong Fang looked at Mo Xiu with admiration.
　　 whispered: "It's awesome, I won the game, and I got a cute girl, the game is a girl! A new way!"
　　 
       
 
           


　　 In the shock of the audience, the match between Class 6 and Class 11 ended.
　　 In the end, all four members of Class Six were promoted. The four members of Class Six, Mo Xiu, Dong Fang, Mu Mu and He Lingyue, formed the new Class 6.
　　 There was a commotion among the students off the field, because the match between Mo Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo was too weird. It started inexplicably, and the shocking process ended in confusion.
　　 Mo Xiu exited the game and returned to Dong Fang.
Dong Fang hugged Mo Xiu and said, "Boss Mo, you are too awesome. You can still pick up girls in the game. How did you do it? Why didn't you find you so good before? You also know the purpose of reporting to the auxiliary department, so hurry up and teach. A few tricks, brother, you will be my boss in the future, no! Idol!"
　　 Mo Xiu said angrily: "You know what a fart, that girl named Yang Qingzhuo is very farsighted."
　　 At this time, He Lingyue and Mu Mu also walked over, curious as to how Yang Qingzhuo had a foresight, and now everyone was at a loss.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "It's not convenient to talk about it here. Let's watch the game first and talk about it after the game."
After 　　, there were competitions between Class 7 and Class 10, and Class 8 and Class 9, in which a girl caught Mo Xiu's attention.
　　 Mumu came over and said: "Mo Xiu, this girl is called Xiao Lan, her skill is the blue flame on her body, and you are both the favorites in the auxiliary department to win the championship, she is also the younger sister Xiao Hong's sister."
　　 Mo Xiu didn't have much interest in the first place. He just thought that Xiao Lan was relatively strong, and when he heard Xiao Hong's name, he grew big, that unreasonable woman.
　　 At the end of the day in the evening, Cao Fenglin yawned and walked to the center of the court.
　　 "Promoted students will come here tomorrow. The eliminated ones will not be used. When the selection is completed, everyone will gather here. Okay, let's go!"
　　 Regardless of whether they were promoted or not, most of the students walked out with a sigh. How could they meet such a teacher?
　　 After Mo Xiu walked out, he wanted to go back to the dormitory first, but he was stopped by He Lingyue and Mu Mu.
　　 Mumu asked, "Mo Xiu, what the **** is going on with you and Yang Qingzhuo? I'm so anxious."
　　 He Lingyue also looked expectantly at Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu had no choice but to take a few people to the cafeteria and chat while eating.
　　 Mumu was impatient, and as soon as he sat down, he said impatiently, "Mo Xiu can talk now, right?"
　　 Mo Xiu sold Guan Zi and said: "Yang Qing Zhuo Ming knew that it was impossible to beat me, so he took the initiative to challenge me, can't you guess why?"
　　 The three of them shook their heads, and Mu Mu said unhappily: "Oh, Mo Xiu, please speak quickly, why?"
　　 "Because she wants to join me!"
　　 Mu's eyes rolled and said, "Join the strongest club?"
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head and said, "No, do you remember the rules of the game that Teacher Cao said?"
　　 Hearing the light flashing in He Lingyue's eyes here, he clearly understood.
Mu Mu whispered: "Four people will be selected for the singles knockout, and then the top two will select their own team as a team to qualify...Ah! I see, she wants you to win in the end. Later, take her to participate in the school’s team competition."
　　 Mo Xiu said, "Yes, that's what she thinks. Today, she chose me to play against to show me my strength."
　　 He Lingyue said: "In the end you agreed, so she gave up?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded in response, He Lingyue and Mu Mu were both thoughtful, only Dong Fang was unhappy.
　　 Dong Fang said: "So you are not picking up girls, hey, Bai is excited."
　　 Mo Xiu ignored this stubborn guy and smiled.
　　 He Lingyue asked in a meaningful way: "Why did Yang Qingzhuo do this? With her strength, it is possible to enter the semi-finals? By then, won't both the heads-up and team competitions be able to advance?"
　　 Mo Xiu said: "I also thought about this issue, maybe she thinks the heads-up match is of little significance."
　　 "Yes, heads-up matches are meaningless to support."
　　The person who spoke was Yang Qingzhuo. She appeared behind several people at some unknown time.
The few people in 　　 were a little embarrassed. After all, they were discovered after discussing others behind their backs.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo sat down indifferently, sitting beside Mo Xiu.
"I don't think heads-up is of any significance to support. A good support only needs to do two things. One is the primary task to help the team win, and the other is to have the ability to protect yourself as much as possible and not become a burden to the team. "
　　 Mumu disagrees and said: "Then what if a person faces the enemy?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo leaned against Mo Xiu and said: "A good support must become the shadow of the main attacker, inseparable!"
　　 A few people have weird eyes, Yang Qingzhuo's words and actions are very ambiguous, it is inevitable that people want to be crooked.
　　 Dong Fang's eyes lit up, and he thought that after all, wouldn't Mo Xiu still pick up girls?
　　 He Lingyue asked: "That one more spot for promotion in the heads-up tournament will help you too."
Yang Qingzhuo posted to Mo Xiu again, saying: "That quota is dispensable. If I did not choose to play against Mo Xiu today, I might be promoted, but I lost the opportunity to team up with Mo Xiu. I think I The choice is correct."
　　 Yang Qingzhuo looked at Mo Xiu affectionately and said, "This is my way of assistance!"
　　 Mo Xiu was taken aback by Yang Qingzhuo's look, and his eyes quickly avoided.
　　 Mumu asked curiously: "What is your way of assistance?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo proudly said: "The team is the mainstay, and there is..."
　　 At this point, Yang Qingzhuo lowered his head shyly.
　　 "There is also...recognize the lord! Mo Xiu is my lord!!!"
　　 I don't know if it was nervousness or what was the reason. When Mo Xiu was my master in the last sentence, his voice improved a lot, and the students around him heard the reputation.
　　There are many students from the assistant department. They all showed such expressions when they saw this scene~www.mtlnovel.com~.
　　 Mo Xiu held his head and lowered his head. He originally thought Yang Qingzhuo was a very visionary girl, and understood that the future of assistance was the team.
　　 I didn't expect that she would come out like this. This time it can be a big trouble. Depending on the degree of discussion among the students around, this matter will spread quickly.
　　 Dong Fang became more excited as he listened, and finally couldn't control his excitement. He patted the table and spilled all the food on the table, and stood up and shouted.
　　 "Mo Xiu!!! Great!!!"
　　 Dong Fang thought it was an exciting moment, but he embarrassed Mo Xiu and didn't dare to look up. What is it all about.
　　 The people around not only looked strangely at Yang Qingzhuo, but also looked at He Lingyue and Mu Mu who were sitting with Mo Xiu.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo finally realized that something was wrong at this time, looked around, and ran away holding his flushed face.
　　 The atmosphere at the scene was extremely embarrassing for a while, and Mu Mu felt that his worldview had been impacted, and was stunned there.
　　 He Lingyue asked Mo Xiu: "Mo Xiu, or shall we go first?"
　　 Mo Xiu had this intention long ago, and left with a few people running away.
　　 Mo Xiu and Dong Fang went straight to the dormitory, and said to Dong Fang as they walked: "What are you doing in the cafeteria? Tomorrow in the private room of the fifth martial arts field, we will learn from each other."
　　 Dong Fang heard about the last time Liu Ziyang and Mo Xiu discussed each other, so he shook his head in fright and did not dare to speak.
　　 Mo Xiu sighed, why are these pig teammates all around him?
　　 Back to the dormitory, Mo Xiu turned on his mobile phone and saw that a photo was going viral on the Internet within the scope of Yanjing University.
　　 Mo Xiu sat with his forehead, Yang Qingzhuo sat next to him with his face covered, Dong Fang stood and looked excited.
　　 There are four characters on the picture.
　　 "Mo Xiu! Great!!!"
    
   


　　 Looking at the crazy picture, Mo Xiu has the urge to hit Dong Fang now.
　　 Forget it, Mo Xiu didn't bother to watch it, so he just shut down and went to sleep.
　　 The next morning, Mo Xiu walked out of the dormitory and felt the feeling of being a star. Everywhere he went, there were people watching him.
　　 came downstairs, Yang Qingzhuo was waiting upstairs.
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "What are you doing here?"
　　 "I'm waiting for you!"
　　 Mo Xiu asked strangely: "Wait for me? Don't you need to go to the department trial today?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo said playfully: "Um, the teacher said no, but he didn't say not to go. I will accompany you to the game. Did you forget what I said yesterday? I am your shadow."
　　 Dong Fang didn't dare to talk nonsense after yesterday's incident, so he quietly followed Mo Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo.
　　The passerby looked at him with weird eyes, and Mo Xiu was somewhat uncomfortable.
　　 "You go back and wait. You don't need to follow me. I will choose you when the result of the game comes out."
　　 "I know that you will choose me, then I will follow you too. This will help the two of us develop relationships."
　　 Mo Xiu really couldn't make sense of this girl, so she had to give up persuasion and let her follow.
After 　　 came to the stadium, Mo Xiu was shocked. There were more people here than yesterday. Didn't Cao Fengqing say that the eliminated people are not used? How come there are so many?
　　 Mo Xiu will understand in the next second that these people are all coming to him.
　　 A group of men shouted, "Mo Xiu! Great!!" Walking towards Mo Xiu.
　　 "Mo Xiu, tell me quickly, how did you let the little loli next to you recognize the Lord, just teach me a trick."
　　 "You go up there and you don't have any sincerity. How can Moshen teach you? Moshen, I will pay 100,000 yuan for the registration fee, how about?"
　　 Mo Xiu's heart is not good, it may not be low-key now.
　　 Just then Cao Fenglin's voice sounded, and Mo Xiu felt that Cao Fenglin was so cute for the first time.
　　 "What are you doing? This is the selection venue in the auxiliary department, and everyone who doesn't care will go out for me!"
　　 When everyone saw that the teacher was coming, all those who were not in the auxiliary department evacuated.
　　 Cao Fenglin closed the door and said, "Mo Xiu, you are very popular, and you have fans."
　　 Mo Xiu didn't expect that Cao Fenglin would make jokes in public, so he could only smile awkwardly.
　　 Now the audience's attitude towards Mo Xiu is divided into two extremes. Boys look at Mo Xiu with envy, while girls look with disgust.
　　 Mo Xiu spent the whole morning in these two eye changes.
　　 Finally it was Mo Xiu's turn in the afternoon to compete in the new Class 6.
　　 "The new 3rd and 6th squad enters and chooses opponents."
　　 The new third class is three girls and one boy. Although the three girls looked at Mo Xiu with murderous intent in their eyes, they still knew the importance and didn't want to face Mo Xiu.
　　 Finally, the people of the new third class proposed to use the plan that Mo Xiu proposed last time to group.
　　 At the end of the group, Mo Xiu confronted a girl with short hair and a neutral look.
　　 The girl snorted coldly and said, "Mo Xiu, don't think that my old lady is easy to deal with. Even if you can't beat you, you still have to suffer a little bit. The scumbag who plays with women, bah!
　　 The voice of this short-haired girl was not small, and everyone who was watching had heard it. There were already many girls in the auxiliary department. At this time, I remembered the overwhelming shouts.
　　 "Mo Xiu, scumbag!"
　　 Cao Fenglin saw that this posture was about to affect the progress of the game, so he hurriedly stopped.
　　 "Be quiet, don't bring personal grievances into the game. Now that the division is finished, let's start the game."
　　 A few people all entered. I don't know if it was because of strength or notoriety. Almost all the students came to watch Mo Xiu's game.
　　 Although Mo Xiu felt annoyed, but he was not affected much. According to the usual practice, he launched God's prying on short-haired girls.
　　"One skill: weakened
　　 Skill effect: weaken a single target, reduce speed, strength, and concentration by 30%
　　 Duration: three minutes
　　Cooling time: three hours"
　　 Negative state skills? It was the first time that Mo Xiu had encountered it. This skill was difficult to handle, and there was no possibility of opportunism.
　　 Because whether Moxiu uses the skill first, or the opponent weakens first, the reduction value is the same.
　　 In this case, Mo Xiu simply used the Arrival of the Valkyrie to feel the feeling of being suddenly weakened.
　　 Mo Xiu saw that the opponent hadn't moved, so he took the initiative to attack.
　　 The girls off the field saw Mo Xiu's actions, and someone immediately said, "It really is a scum man, against a girl, with such a big advantage, he actually attacked by himself, bah! scum man!"
　　 "Yes! Scumbag!"
　　 "Moxiu, the scumbag!"
　　 Mo Xiu listened to the sounds off the court, his movements did not stop at all. When he was about to reach the short-haired girl, his body was covered with red light, and then he sank.
　　 Mo Xiu stands still and feels his body, is this a negative state?
　　 In order to feel the impact of weakening on himself, Mo Xiu did not rush to knock out his opponent, but slowly played against his opponent.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't feel much. The girls off the scene fryed the pot when they saw this scene.
　　 "Do you want to take advantage of this pervert, groping and hitting like this?"
　　 "Look at that wretched look, that's it, it's too much, I won't let it go if I'm a girl."
　　 The boys' eyes are bright, this is a good way to take advantage.
　　 all shouted unified slogans in unison.
　　 "Mo Xiu! Great!"
　　 There was a chaos off the court, and Cao Fenglin sighed and said to himself: "Hey, it's so nice to be young, the department trials are almost becoming Mo Xiu's solo concert."
　　Mo Xiu was also annoyed by it. At this time, he felt almost the same. The impact of this weakening on him was diminishing with the passage of time. At first, there would be some flaws and some flaws, but then he slowly recovered.
　　In other words, skills like weaken are the most threatening the first time they are activated, which will disrupt the attack rhythm.
　　 Mo Xiu suddenly exerted his force and pushed a palm to the arm of a short-haired girl~www.mtlnovel.com~ and pushed it out of bounds.
　　 With Mo Xiu's victory, all four games were decided. The four members of the new sixth class once again advanced to become the new third class.
　　 With the two different voices of "Scumbag" and "Awesome", Mo Xiu retired, and next to the last set of the new 4th and 5th classes, Mo Xiu finally stopped for a while.
　　 Taking advantage of the last set of competitions, Mo Xiu told Cao Fenglin and left first, so as not to have to wait for a while and cause trouble again.
　　 Mo Xiu, who walked out of the stadium, was in a good mood and was finally clean.
　　 As I walked forward, I felt that someone was dragging me behind. I looked back and there was no one. When I lowered my head, I saw Yang Qingzhuo tugging at the corner of his clothes, looking at him pitifully.
　　 Mo Xiu sighed and said, "Hey, how do you follow?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo said: "Mo Xiu, am I causing you trouble? I will explain it for you."
　　 Looking at Yang Qingzhuo's pitiful appearance, Mo Xiu couldn't bear to blame.
　　 "It's okay, you don't have to explain to me, just like that."
　　 Just kidding, Mo Xiu was scared, Yang Qingzhuo can't explain it any more, the more black it gets, it will be over. This kind of news will be forgotten by people after a long time, so let him go.
　　 At this time, Mo Xiu's phone rang. He picked it up and saw that it was Liu Ziyang. This guy has been under a lot of pressure in the game recently.
　　 "Hello? What's the matter? I don't want to say something, Mo Xiu is awesome, right?"
　　 Liu Ziyang never dared to talk nonsense after the last ‘discussion’.
　　 "No, Boss, Zheng Yi wants to get together. I called you yesterday and you turned off and found me. Can you see tonight?"
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at the follower beside him.
 "okay!"
　　

 
       
 
           


　　 Don't hesitate to think about it, anyway, I can't get rid of this stalker. It's troublesome to be seen around the school, so it's better to take her out.
　　 Mo Xiu walked in front, Yang Qingzhuo, the little follower, followed Mo Xiu, and some of the girls passing by cast contemptuous glances.
　　 "Get someone else's girl, and you won't wait for someone to walk! Humph!"
　　 The two came to the door. Liu Ziyang was already waiting. Several people got in Qiangzi's car and came to Zheng Yi's school.
　　 Zheng Yi’s school is called Qingyun University, which is second only to Yenching University.
　　 The reason why a few people came to Zheng Yi instead of Zheng Yi going to Yenching University is because there is a very famous food street near this school.
　　 Mo Xiu, a few people parked at the school gate, a few people got out of the car, Qiangzi left first if he had something to do.
　　I heard Zheng Yi's hearty laugh as soon as he got out of the car.
　　 "Hahaha, Mo Xiu, Liu Ziyang, you guys want to kill me."
　　 Zheng Yi came over and hugged Mo Xiu first, and then Liu Ziyang. After holding the two people, he found that Mo Xiu was still with a girl.
　　 Zheng Yi said strangely, "Mo Xiu, who is this? You won't introduce it."
　　 "Oh, she is my teammate, Yang Qingzhuo."
　　 "Is it just a teammate?"
　　 Liu Ziyang did not hold back and interrupted, "Zheng Yi, this is the girl in the photo."
　　 Zheng Yi also saw that picture yesterday, and it was only then that he realized it.
　　 "Understood, understand all!"
　　 Mo Xiu was too lazy to explain, and then changed the subject: "Stop talking nonsense, come to your home court, and lead the way to entertain us!"
　　 Zheng Yi smiled and said: "No problem, wrap it around me, come with me, I know there is a hot pot that is great, let's go together."
　　 It can be seen that Zheng Yi is very familiar with each other, and brought a few people to a hot pot restaurant.
　　 Zheng Yi reported his name, and the waiter arranged a private room for several people.
　　 Everyone was seated, Zheng Yi handed the menu to Mo Xiu and said, "Come on, Mo Xiu, order some dishes."
　　 Mo Xiu looked through the menu, it said some lamb and beef Mo Xiu had never eaten.
　　 Due to the mutation, most animals have natural skills. After the war, they signed a war-free contract and the animals were completely evacuated from human territory. Now all meat is artificially bred and the price is very expensive.
　　 Mo Xiu couldn't eat it before. The best meat he ever had was the pheasant made by his mother.
　　 I don't want to order Mo Xiu and don't want to install it, so he passes the menu to the fat man Liu Ziyang directly.
　　 Liu Ziyang directly pushed the menu to Zheng Yi.
　　 "You order, I have no choice but to eat enough."
　　 Zheng Yi took the menu and wanted to order it himself, but suddenly saw Yang Qingzhuo sitting next to Mo Xiu.
　　 "Sister, you can order a few dishes. Pick the ones you like. I will treat you. If I can't afford it, there will be Liu Ziyang, the God of Wealth."
　　 Yang Qingzhuo took the menu, looked up at Mo Xiu, and saw Mo Xiu nodding, as if she had turned on the switch, she who had never spoken much, rolled up her sleeves and opened the menu.
　　 "Five copies of fine lamb meat!"
　　 "Um...this veal is your signature? Come five!"
　　 "This colorful meat platter looks good, five servings!"
　　 Zheng Yi widened his eyes and looked at Yang Qingzhuo and then at Mo Xiu. What happened? Can this little girl eat so much?
　　 Mo Xiu saw that something was wrong, and whispered in Yang Qingzhuo's ear: "I order so many, can I finish it?"
　　 When Yang Qingzhuo heard this, he looked at Mo Xiu with watery eyes and said, "Mo Xiu, won't you give me enough food?"
　　 The waiter looked at Mo Xiu with a strange look. How long has been hungry for such a cute girlfriend to keep eating.
　　 Mo Xiu couldn’t help but pointed at a meat that looked good on the menu and said, "This one will come with five dishes too!"
　　 The waiter's eyes immediately changed again, he seemed to be a good man, he knew he loved his girlfriend.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo smiled brightly and continued to order.
　　 ordered ten plates of meat again, pondered for a long time, looked at everyone, as if making a major decision, nodded heavily, and handed the menu to the waiter.
　　 "Sure, that's it."
　　 Mo Xiu asked, "Would you like to order some dishes? It's all meat."
　　 Yang Qingzhuo said: "Isn't eating hot pot all about eating meat?"
　　 Mo Xiu, the three of them were speechless, the meat was very fast, four people, thirty plates of meat, the whole table could not fit.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Liu Ziyang, which meant that the meat is up to you.
　　 The waiter on the side wanted to help the meat, but Yang Qingzhuo refused.
　　 After waiting for the waiter to go out, Yang Qingzhuo picked up two plates of meat and threw them into the hot pot roughly.
　　 while throwing it, said: "They are too slow to lay the meat, let's do it ourselves, hehe."
　　 The few people who were worried about having too many points just now felt relieved in less than five minutes.
　　 Because Yang Qingzhuo fished out all the two plates of meat, divided them among four people, and then skillfully threw two plates into the pot.
After 　　, he sat down and ate up his own portion of meat, looking expectantly at the uncooked meat in the pot.
　　 When the meat is cooked and all the meat is removed, repeat the process just now.
　　 Seeing that Mo Xiu, Zheng Yi, and Liu Ziyang didn't finish the meat on their plates, they put all the meat on their plates. There was too much meat to fit, and they asked the waiter for a small bowl.
　　 Within a few minutes, I ate up two whole plates of meat, and continued to fish for meat.
　　 Seeing that Mo Xiu and the three of them all looked at themselves in a daze, Yang Qingzhuo said embarrassedly: "Why don't you... don't eat, you just eat, I will give you... the meat!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo said that everything was unfavorable, and Zheng Yi secretly gave Mohebi a thumbs up when he saw it.
　　 is so edible, will Mo Xiu be able to raise it in the future?
　　 After half an hour, Yang Qingzhuo was left alone, eating a full 22 plates of meat before stopping.
　　 Mo Xiu felt that he saw a monster for the first time, a girl who grew up so small, how did UU reading www.uukanshu.com eat so much meat? Is it the whole body is the stomach?
　　 Yang Qingzhuo clutched his bulging belly, smiled satisfied, and looked content.
After 　　 sat in the position and stopped talking, she became a quiet girl again.
　　 This can't be called a foodie, it should be called a **** of food!
　　 For half an hour, the three of Mo Xiu watched Yang Qingzhuo's performance almost the whole time, and didn't eat much.
　　 After Yang Qingzhuo finished eating, the few people really started to eat and chat.
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "Zheng Yi, you didn't die at Qingyun University, right?"
　　 Zheng Yi said unwillingly: "When did I die? Behaved well, to the point of your reputation, Mo Xiu Niubi is called our school."
　　 Speaking of this, Zheng Yi glanced at Yang Qingzhuo next to him. He didn't feel good, so he didn't continue.
　　 "By the way, I will tell you something good at first sight. I have a girlfriend. Let me show you."
　　 Zheng Yi took out his mobile phone and showed Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang a few photos.
　　 The girls on the top have elegant temperament, quite like a goddess.
　　 Mo Xiu knows Zheng Yi best, and said: "It's your girlfriend, you have brought it here to show off. I look like these photos were taken secretly."
　　 Zheng Yi was dismantled, and said embarrassingly: "Ahaha, to be precise, it is my future girlfriend. I haven't caught it yet."
　　 Zheng Yi glared at Mo Xiu, and blamed Mo Xiu for tearing down the stage.
　　 Liu Ziyang laughed as he listened, as if suddenly remembering something.
　　 "That's right! Mo Xiu, Zheng Yi, I heard Hao Ren say that there is a great character in the storming department who belongs to your Shuncheng No. 1 Middle School. I don't know if you know him?"
　　 "Who?" Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi said in unison.
　　 "Zhou Qiuwu!"

　　 Mo Xiu thought for a while, some impressions, but he couldn't remember who it was.
　　 Zheng Yi said: "Mo Xiu, you forgot even the famous Zhou Qiuwu? Awakened two skills, but then it seems that I didn't take the college entrance examination. It should have been enrolled in Yanjing University."
　　 Mo Xiu just remembered that Zhou Qiuwu was a man of the world for a while, but then he slowly disappeared from the sight of everyone, and he did not expect to show his head again at Yenching University.
　　 Mo Xiu and Zheng Yi hadn’t seen each other for more than half a month, and they had finished their meal in the gossip.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't stay long after the meal and went straight back to Yanjing University. After all, he had to participate in the departmental trials the next day, and it was not too late to play.
　　 When he returned to the dormitory, Yang Qingzhuo followed Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Little pet, I'm going back to the dormitory, are you still following?"
　　 "Little follower? Is it your nickname for me?"
　　 "Not a nickname, you are a little stalker, an edible stalker."
　　 "My dorm is here too!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo followed Mo Xiu up to the third floor.
　　 "I'm here, what floor are you on? Go back!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo pointed upstairs, and finally left reluctantly.
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head, a little helpless, what can I do? Yang Qingzhuo still depends on himself.
　　 Back to the dormitory, Mo Xiu lay on the bed to go to sleep.
　　 A message came from the phone, which was sent by Mu Qingyi.
　　 There is only one picture, the famous ‘Mo Xiu Niubi! ’, Mo Xiu patted his head, this matter still passed to Mu Qingyi, I don’t know who leaked it out.
　　Mo Xiu came back.
 "Jealous?"
　　 Mu Qingyi's reply was still the same picture.
　　‘Mo Xiu is awesome! ’
　　 "What do you mean? Are you jealous?"
　　‘Mo Xiu is awesome! ’
　　 "Can you post something else?"
　　 Mu Qingyi stopped sending pictures this time and typed directly.
　　 "Mo Xiu is awesome!"
　　 "Hahaha, this is actually a misunderstanding..."
　　 Mo Xiu explained for a long time, and he didn't know if Mu Qingyi had listened to it.
　　......
　　 speechless all night.
　　 Early the next morning, Yang Qingzhuo waited at the door of Moxiu on time.
　　 Mo Xiu sighed, he couldn't hide it anyway, so be it.
　　 came to the trial venue in the department, there were obviously fewer people today, and now there are only four teams with a total of 16 people left.
　　 Those who have been promoted have already competed for two rounds, and those who want to know about their opponents know the same thing. Those who have not promoted come here to watch the game, it is better to spare more time to train.
　　 There are four classes left. In the morning, I was scheduled to the new third class where Mo Xiu is.
　　The way of choosing opponents is the same as before, this time Mo Xiu is finally fighting a boy.
　　 This boy is very polite. After entering the venue, he did not start the game the first time, but introduced himself.
"My name is Guo Fan. I am very happy to be able to play against you. I may not be able to beat you, but from the perspective of learning, I hope you can go all out in the game. One is to let me know the gap, and the other is... .."
　　 Five hundred words are omitted here.
　　 Mo Xiu listened very annoyingly, and wanted to interrupt the other party with an exit, but Guo Fan's speech speed was too fast to be able to intervene at all.
　　 The other three games are over, Guo Fan is still talking.
　　 Cao Fenglin looked at his watch. It was almost time to eat. He endured it for another five minutes without stopping.
　　 "Guo Fan, you are disqualified from the competition, Mo Xiu wins!"
Guo Fan paused for a second and said to Cao Fenglin: "Teacher, I can play, do you think I can't beat Mo Xiu? Even if I can't, I can contribute a wonderful game to the students. Why did you cancel it? My game rules? I..."
　　 Cao Fenglin pointed to a few classmates and said, "Drag him out for me!"
　　 Several classmates dragged Guo Fan out, and Guo Fan still reluctantly said: "Teacher, I can fight, I can fight..."
　　 Mo Xiu thought it was funny. Who are these people? I didn't expect to be promoted today without doing anything.
　　 This time the new third class Mumu was eliminated, and the remaining three were promoted to the second class.
　　 Mumu was a little unhappy, she was a little unhappy, who was always ostentatious.
　　 Mu's skills are not very strong, and his inability to advance is actually expected.
　　 What is surprising is that Cao Fenglin, a man who didn't want to control anything, actually came to comfort Mu Mu. Mu Mu was also coaxed by him and laughed.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at He Lingyue. He Lingyue has been with Mumu, and he should know something.
　　 But He Lingyue spread his hands and said that he was unclear, but looking at Cao Fenglin's appearance, things are not simple.
　　 Seeing the two talking and laughing, Mo Xiu and the others left secretly without waiting for Mumu.
　　 A few people walked out of the stadium, but He Lingyue repeatedly said nothing.
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "He Lingyue, do you have anything you want to tell me?"
　　 He Lingyue looked at Mo Xiu, and then at Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 "Mo Xiu, can you choose me when forming a team? I can use my skills for you."
　　 Mo Xiu had long known that He Lingyue's skill "Future Man" could be used by others, but at this time he still pretended to be surprised.
　　 Before Mo Xiu could speak, Yang Qingzhuo stood in front of Mo Xiu and looked at He Lingyue fiercely.
　　 He Lingyue chuckled and said, "Haha, I'm not trying to grab your master, I just want to join his team."
　　 said, looking at Mo Xiu, waiting for a reply.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "I know, I will choose you then."
　　 He Lingyue said: "Thank you, then I'm leaving, bye!"
　　 Mo Xiu understands why He Lingyue mentioned this matter at this time, because now there are only eight finalists left in the trials, and the remaining opponents are very strong, it is difficult for He Lingyue to make further progress.
　　 Dong Fang has recently pursued a goal and left in a hurry.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't know where to take the little stalker, Hao Ren called and asked Mo Xiu to go to the activity room of the strongest club.
　　 It's okay anyway~www.mtlnovel.com~ Just go and see what Hao Ren is doing recently.
　　 As soon as he entered the activity room, Mo Xiu saw a girl sitting next to Hao Ren.
　　 a tight leather jacket, the overall feeling is particularly capable.
　　 Hao Ren smiled secretly when he saw Mo Xiu following Yang Qingzhuo behind him.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Why do you laugh? Talk about business, this is..."
　　 Hao Ren suddenly got up and gave Mo Xiu an introduction.
　　 "This is Du Ya, from the Elemental School. After screening through big data, I found this suitable candidate with great difficulty."
　　 Mo Xiu was a little strange. Looking at her dress, she thought that Du Ya was from the sensitive attack system, but he didn't expect it to be from the element system.
　　 Mo Xiu stretched out his hand and said, "Hello, my name is Mo Xiu. From now on, you will be a member of our strongest society."
　　 Du Ya ignored Mo Xiu's right hand extended, and said coldly: "You are the scumbag Mo Xiu? But it doesn't matter. My requirement to enter your club is not to participate in the selection and go directly to the club battle."
　　 Mo Xiu stretched out his hand again and said, "No problem, happy cooperation."
　　Duya's philosophy is the same as Mo Xiu, of course Mo Xiu is willing to accept it.
　　 Du Ya still ignored Mo Xiu, stood up and said, "I have finished writing the application to join the club. I will leave if there is nothing wrong."
　　 Mo Xiu retracted his right hand and looked at Hao Ren.
　　 Hao Ren smiled and said: "She is like this, but she has no strength to say. I think you have brought some people. Did she join our club?"
　　 Mo Xiu looked back, Yang Qingzhuo just finished the call and looked at Mo Xiu.
　　 "Yang Qingzhuo, have you joined the club?"
　　 "I just called and quit the previous club. Where is your application for joining the club? Give me one..."

　　 In the martial arts training ground No. 3, the auxiliary department trial.
　　 Today, Cao Fenglin cleared out all the eliminated players, leaving only the two promoted classes, and... Mu Mu.
　　 According to Cao Fenglin, Mu Mu will be his assistant from now on.
　　 This time, Cao Fenglin changed his former sloppiness, and he didn't let the two classes choose their opponents, instead he divided them into groups.
　　 I don't know if it is Mo Xiu's illusion, Cao Fenglin seems to be different.
　　 The grouping situation is that Mo Xiu is facing a girl named Hu Xianming, and He Lingyue is facing the strongest Xiao Lan on the other side.
　　 As soon as the group came out, He Lingyue looked at Mo Xiu helplessly, meaning that I was out of play, it was all up to you.
　　 There are no other people in the venue, it is very quiet, and four groups are still going on at the same time.
　　 Mo Xiu launches God's prying on Hu Xianming.
　　"Skill: Holy Light 2
　　 Skill effect: Within ten minutes, the Holy Light can be activated on any target ten times, and the Holy Light can heal and purify negative states.
　　Cooling time: 6 hours"
　　 Pure nanny? Such a pure nanny can actually advance to the quarterfinals?
　　 Mo Xiu hadn't noticed Hu Xianming before, and didn't know how she played.
　　 Hu Xianming said: "Can you start?"
　　 Mo Xiu made a request to clean up and signaled the opponent to attack first.
　　 Hu Xianming was not polite, so he attacked directly and punched Mo Xiu in the chest.
　　 Mo Xiu just wanted to block, Hu Xianming fisted suddenly, and attacked Mo Xiu's face.
　　 Mo Xiu immediately launched the descent of the **** of war, and quickly retreated.
　　 This is ancient martial arts! I haven't seen it for a long time! Mo Xiu had also studied ancient martial arts before, but his knowledge was limited after all, he only knew some basics, such as Baguazhang.
　　 Later, after Wang Lei's teaching in the universe cram school, he slowly discovered that he tried to simplify his tricks as much as possible and was the most effective against the enemy.
　　 Mo Xiu has not encountered an ancient martial arts like Xiang Hu Xianming, with various tricks.
　　 just gave Mo Xiu some vigilance, don't underestimate the opponent at any time.
　　 The two tried again, this time Mo Xiu took the initiative a lot, without any remaining hands, and attacked with all his strength.
　　 No matter how strong Hu Xianming's tricks are, he still loses steadily under the suppression of absolute power.
　　 Hu Xianming's tactics are both offensive and defensive, without a trace of flaws, Mo Xiu can only force Hu Xianming back and consume her.
　　 After a long game, even if Hu Xianming could block Mo Xiu's attack, he would still suffer some injuries, and his physical strength would have been declining.
　　 Mo Xiu seized the opportunity and punched Hu Xianming on the shoulder!
　　 Hu Xianming didn't evade, but took the punch firmly, and when Mo Xiu thought he was holding the winning ticket, Hu Xianming sent a burst of white light on his body, which was a holy light skill.
　　 Mo Xiu's fist and holy light appeared on Hu Xianming's body at the same time, which actually offset the damage!
　　 Hu Xianming was surprised, and punched Mo Xiu with a fist in the air for a second time, knocking Mo Xiu back one step.
　　 Mo Xiu was more excited than ever, this Hu Xianming is too powerful!
　　Using the skills to the extreme, using the effect of the holy light to offset the damage caused by the enemy's attack, wonderful! The timing is also very good.
　　 There was also a punch that just hit Mo Xiu, obviously using a special way of exerting force, otherwise Hu Xianming's power would not be able to repel Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "That's it! Would you like to team up with me in a team battle?"
　　 Hu Xianming looked at Mo Xiu and said, "Sorry, I promised Sister Xiao Lan to join her team."
　　 Mo Xiu was not disappointed, but smiled and said: "I'm going to fix you. It seems that I need to beat Xiao Lan to win the championship to get you!"
　　 Mo Xiu said this out of appreciation.
　　 Fortunately, there are no spectators around, otherwise there will be scumbags who are whistling and tsunami.
　　 Hu Xianming didn't expect Mo Xiu to say this, and snorted coldly, "Stop hitting me first!"
　　 Both fists fisted towards Mo Xiu, Mo Xiu drew away from his side, and Hu Xianming's fist turned to continue attacking.
　　 Mo Xiu was not in a hurry, he became more and more curious about Hu Xianming's set of boxing, which he could still use in the second stage, and learned how to do it.
　　 Hu Xianming thought Mo Xiu was learning her own boxing technique, and found it funny. She started practicing this boxing technique since she was a child, and she has only achieved a little success now, so how could she learn it so easily.
　　 At first, Hu Xianming just thought Mo Xiu was funny, but the more he fought, the more frightened he became. What's wrong with this person? After only a dozen strokes, the boxing technique looks a little bit better.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't exert his strength, and Hu Xianming's pressure would naturally not be great.
　　 But at this moment Hu Xianming frowned tightly. The man named Mo Xiu in front of him had a touch of charm with his own boxing, which was a monster!
　　 Mo Xiu has a preliminary understanding of the principle of the second stage of force, and he has also figured out one or two of the insatiable boxing routines, but there are still some problems in the connection between the two moves.
　　 Mo Xiu was enjoying the fight, and Hu Xianming suddenly hit Mo Xiu's arm with both palms, backing back with the rebound force.
　　 then raised his right hand and said to Cao Fenglin: "Teacher, I give up and stop fighting!"
　　 Mo Xiu said, "How can you give up like this?"
　　 Hu Xianming secretly scolded Mo Xiu for trying to pretend to be confused, and if he continued to fight, he might have learned the entire boxing technique.
　　 Cao Fenglin announced: "Mo Xiu wins!"
　　 Mo Xiu said unwillingly: "Well, this game is over, but you must remember that I need you in my team!"
　　 Hu Xianming looked at Mo Xiu with complicated eyes. On the one hand, he wanted to fulfill his promise with Xiao Lan. On the other hand, he felt that Mo Xiu's strength was indeed terrifying.
　　 lowered his head and thought, still did not speak, turned his head and walked out of the stadium.
　　 Mo Xiu thought he must be the last one to finish the game so slow, but Dong Fang didn't expect it to be slower.
　　 The one who has been promoted is a girl named Xue Ling'er~www.mtlnovel.com~ who was not very familiar with it before, and Xiao Lan, who knocked out He Lingyue without accident, was promoted.
　　 At this time, Dong Fang didn't end because he was in a hard fight, but the opponent's skills were also strengthening defenses, and neither of them could break through the opponent's defense.
　　 remained in a stalemate like this, Mo Xiu looked at the guy opposite, who was neither tall nor strong.
　　 Mo Xiu gave a light cough, and when Dong Fang looked at him, he pushed He Lingyue beside him.
　　 He Lingyue looked at Mo Xiu suspiciously and said, "What are you pushing me for?"
　　 Mo Xiu said: "You are so small, shouldn't I push you?"
　　 Although He Lingyue had a calm temper, she couldn't bear Mo Xiu's provocation. Just about to get angry, she saw Mo Xiu winking at herself.
　　 He Lingyue didn't quite understand what Mo Xiu meant, so she simply ignored him and turned her head to watch the game.
　　 When he saw Dong Fang's actions, he suddenly realized that this was helping Dong Fang cheating.
　　 Dong Fang relied on his weight advantage to push the opponent away, trying to push his opponent out of the field.
　　 Mo Xiu did that just now. He clearly wanted to tell Dong Fang this method.
　　 The opponent wanted to run, Dong Fang grabbed the opponent tightly with both hands, and finally pushed the opponent out of the bounds.
　　 Cao Fenglin's voice sounded.
　　 "The last game is over, Dong Fang wins!"
　　 then looked at Mumu who was aside.
　　 Mumu stepped forward and said: "The competition is over. The four promoted students are Mo Xiu, Xiao Lan, Xue Linger and Dong Fang. Congratulations, on behalf of the auxiliary department in the school's individual heads-up match!"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded to each other.
　　 Mumu continued: "I’ll be here today, tomorrow morning for the final selection, and one or two will be selected to choose their own team and advance to the school’s team battle!"
　　

    
   


　　 Mo Xiu walked out of the stadium, and the little stalker had been waiting for him as expected.
　　 Hao Ren just called. Starting today, you can register for the club competition and heads-up competition at the student union. The club president needs to bring all the members of the team to sign up.
　　 For clubs with less than 1,000 people, only one team can be played in each grade, and ten people can sign up for heads-up matches.
　　 For clubs with more than 1,000 people, you can play two teams in each grade, and you can sign up for 20 people in the heads-up match.
　　 Each team plus substitutes shall not exceed eight people.
　　 There are only seven people in the strongest club, and they are all first-year students. That is to say, only one first-year team can be registered, and all members can participate in the heads-up match.
　　 Mo Xiu thought for a while, and asked Hao Ren to ask Du Ya what day he was free. Others were more cooperative, but Du Ya was the only one who was difficult to do.
　　 Hao Ren sent a message soon, I'm free today!
　　 Mo Xiu hurriedly summoned all club members to the student union to sign up.
　　 There are seven strongest associations, Mo Xiu, Liu Ziyang, Dong Fang, He Lingyue, Hao Ren, Yang Qingzhuo and Du Ya.
　　When I came to the student union building, I didn't see the huge crowds I imagined, only a dozen teams were sparsely drawn.
　　 Mo Xiu asked Hao Ren, "Hao Ren, why is this all right? So many clubs, just this few people come to sign up?"
　　 Hao Ren is now dedicated to helping Mo Xiu deal with the affairs of the community. He was once knowledgeable, and now he is even more informed.
　　 "Registration is actually set up for some small and medium-sized societies. Some large societies are not used to register at all. The student union will take the initiative to send the declaration form, and they can fill it out."
　　 Mo Xiu asked again: "The number of small and medium-sized societies is not a small number, right?"
　　 "Yes, but at this time, all clubs of a certain size are being selected, or the selection has not yet been performed, and the list of entries has not been determined. Most of these clubs will register again a few days before the deadline for registration."
　　 Liu Ziyang raised his eyebrows and said, "That means, these clubs are now..."
　　 Hao Ren covered his face and said: "Yes, the applicants now come to register, they are all of our kind, and they just happen to be able to gather a set of clubs for the competition, which is the weakest part of the club."
　　 Mo Xiu was unwilling to hear Hao Ren's words.
　　 "Hao Ren, how can you destroy your morale as the vice president? Forgot the name of our club?"
　　 Hao Ren said with a confused look: "When did I become the vice president?"
　　 "Now accept your fate as the vice chairman!"
 "Ok!"
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Hao Ren and the others lacking energy and became angry. The establishment of the club was not for the bottom of the club.
　　 Mo Xiu cleared his throat and said, "Cough cough cough! Let me see that you don’t seem to have much confidence. I set a goal, the goal of a team battle. After all, heads-up matches are all on my own, and there is no way to set a goal."
　　 Upon hearing this, everyone's eyes focused on Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu did not speak, and held out a finger.
　　 Hao Ren said: "The top one hundred?"
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head.
　　 Liu Ziyang said: "Your kid is too small to look down on the boss, it must be in the top ten!"
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head and said: "We have only one goal to participate in the club team competition! The first-year group champion!"
　　 "Cut!"
　　 The other six people were stunned for a second, and then cut all of them. Even the uncomfortable Duya's reaction at this time was surprisingly consistent with everyone.
　　The clubs ranked behind the strongest clubs, everyone looked at Mo Xiu with idiot eyes. Isn't this person crazy?
　　 I will soon be ranked in the strongest club to sign up.
　　 The staff asked mechanically: "The name of the club!"
　　 Mo Xiu replied: "The strongest society!"
　　 The staff looked up at Mo Xiu for a while, as if they wanted to remember Mo Xiu.
　　 "Hey? Are you Mo Xiu? Are you the president of the strongest society?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded.
　　 The staff couldn't help but smile and said, "Haha, it's really awesome, uh... the club number!"
　　 "666!"
　　 "Do you sign up for an individual competition or a team competition?"
　　 "All sign up!"
　　 "Then the individual competition first, the names of the participants?"
　　 Mo Xiu reported the names of the seven people to the staff. Yanjing University focuses on competition education, and no one wants to give up the opportunity to compete.
　　The staff explained: "Well, the individual club heads-up match. The qualifier is on August 15th, so remember to participate on time!"
　　 After that, the staff gave everyone a license to participate, and several people signed a few disclaimers, which is considered a successful registration.
　　The staff continued: "Next is the team competition registration. What is the grade group and the number of participating teams for the strongest club registration?"
　　 Mo Xiu said: "We only have one team, participating in the first-year group competition, the number of teams is seven!"
　　 "Are you sure that seven players will participate? According to the rules, five main players and three substitutes can be allowed, and a total of eight people can participate in the competition. Will you stop calling one person over?"
　　 Mo Xiu said confidently: "It's no longer necessary, just seven people. We just reported to the seven people in the squad."
　　 The six people behind him rolled their eyes. What does it mean to be unnecessary? Can't you find the eighth person?
　　 Since all seven people have filled in the information before, the registration process for the team competition is much faster.
　　 After filling in the information, the staff asked: "The registration for the strongest club team competition is successful, what is the name of the team?"
　　 teams need names, because some clubs will sign up for many teams, and they will use a name to distinguish them.
　　 Mo Xiu looked back at a few people. These people were given for nothing. When the name of the club was named, none of them came out to speak.
　　 Mo Xiu thought for a while, just break the jar.
　　 "The strongest team!"
　　 The staff stared at Mo Xiu with wide eyes. The name of the team will be called out by the host at the match~www.mtlnovel.com~ Is this shameless?
 "you sure?"
　　 Hao Ren pulled Mo Xiu and said, "Mo Xiu, do you want to think about it again, we will pull the hatred."
　　 Mo Xiu said, "Isn't it enough for me to pull hatred?"
　　 Mo Xiu is the president of the strongest society and a scumbag who plays with women, which is equivalent to a group of ridicules throughout the school.
　　 Hao Ren's mouth twitched, and after thinking about it, let Mo Xiu go with him.
　　 Mo Xiu turned back to the staff and said, "I'm sure, it's called the strongest team. My teammates have never seen the world, so you laughed."
　　 The staff didn't know how to answer Mo Xiu, and subconsciously blurted out that famous quote.
　　 "Mo Xiu! Great!"
After 　　 reported their names, everyone went out together, and Liu Ziyang sneaked to the vicinity of Mo Xiu and asked in a low voice.
　　 "Boss, this is not your character, you used to be low-key and low-key, why are you so public?"
　　 "I can't keep a low profile now. In that case, I might as well make him turn upside down and see how capable I am."
　　Mo Xiu slowly understands that the increase in popularity will bring pressure, and this pressure will force him to become stronger. Mo Xiu is a stubborn person and likes this invisible pressure.
　　 In the early morning of the next day, inside the department trial venue.
　　 There are only four people left. Not surprisingly, the champion of the auxiliary department heads-up tournament will be selected tomorrow.
　　 Cao Fenglin walked into the stadium with Mumu. Mumu is now a little secretary, and Mumu is talking most of the time.
　　 "Ms. Cao has never announced the reward for the championship. Now I tell everyone that the champion selected in the auxiliary department will give priority to selecting teammates to form a team. There is also a reward from the auxiliary department, a pure heart tree..."
　　
 
       
 
           


　　 A pure heart tree, this reward is not small.
　　 Qingxinmu also reached the spirit level, but it was not taken, but raised.
　　 As the name suggests, the role of Qingxinmu is to clean the heart. People who live around for a long time can make the brain sober and strengthen the mental power. This is too important for assistance.
　　 Auxiliary must take care of the overall situation on the field, and a strong mental power is indispensable.
　　 Mumu continued: "The next division is, Mo Xiu vs. Dong Fang, Xiao Lan vs. Xue Ling'er, and the two games are played at the same time."
　　 Mo Xiu and Dong Fang looked at each other, Dong Fang was one head and two big.
After 　　 came to play at Yanjing University, Dong Fang had the most contact with Mo Xiu. Not only was he a roommate, but he had also done many tasks with Mo Xiu. Dong Fang couldn't know what kind of strength Mo Xiu was.
　　 Dong Fang would rather face Xiao Lan than confront Mo Xiu.
　　 The four came to the court. Just as Mu Mu announced the start of the game, Dong Fang turned and walked out of bounds.
　　 Mumu announced: "Mo Xiu wins the first group!"
　　 Mo Xiu asked incomprehensibly: "Why did you give in directly? Don't you plan to struggle?"
Dong Fang said with a smug look: "You all treat me stupid. Actually, I'm wise. You always wanted to settle accounts with me about Yang Qingzhuo last time. If I don't admit defeat today, I will definitely get beaten up. Suffer this loss."
　　 Mo Xiu looked funny when Dong Fang looked like a villain.
　　 "Well, you are the smartest."
　　 In this way, Mo Xiu finally has enough time to observe his opponent. Mo Xiu will play to the end in the previous game. There are few opportunities like this.
　　 Mo Xiu and Dong Fang sat side by side at the side of the stadium, watching the match between Xiao Lan and Xue Ling'er.
　　 The game has started, and Mo Xiu has seen Xiao Lan's skills, which are blue flames.
　　 Xiao Lan didn't use any skills at this time, and the two women had been fighting hand-to-hand since the start of the match.
　　 Xue Ling'er is as his name suggests, and he is quite agile with one move, a bit similar to Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 Xiao Lan is an army-style fighting that is open and close, without any extra moves, attacking the vital points.
　　 Xiao Lan's effective attack method is still better, and to seize Xue Linger's flaw is a kick.
　　 In Mo Xiu's view, this kick must be centered, and the speed and power of the kick and the angle, Xue Linger absolutely can't escape.
　　 But when Xiao Lan was kicking immediately, Xue Linger's speed increased to a terrifying level, turning into an afterimage to avoid the attack.
　　 Mo Xiu was stunned. At that moment, Xue Linger probably exploded faster than when Yang Qingzhuo used the skill. What's going on?
　　 After dodging the blow, Xue Linger's speed returned to his normal level.
　　 In the next test, Xue Linger used this method many times to avoid Xiao Lan's attack.
　　 Mo Xiu did not use God's Snoop to check Xue Ling'er's skills. One is that it is not necessary, and the other is that he does not want to rely too much on skills and wants to maintain his own judgment.
　　According to observations, Mo Xiu felt that Xue Linger's skills should be similar to detection skills. When he was about to be attacked, he would speed up dodge or dodge directly.
　　 Xue Ling'er didn't lose, but Xiao Lan didn't use the skills for a long time. Knowing that he didn't have any chance of winning, he simply gave in.
　　 Mu Mu announced the result of the game.
　　 "Xiao Lan won the second game, and now the top two have been decided. The captains of the two teams are Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan. Tomorrow the two will decide the championship, and then choose their own team."
　　 When several people heard Mu Ming's words, they thought that there was nothing wrong with today, and just about to leave, Cao Fenglin, who had not spoken, spoke.
　　 "Mumu, summon all the trial personnel in the department, and watch the final in the afternoon."
　　 Without waiting for Mo Xiu to speak, Mu Mu asked first: "Teacher, will the finals be played this afternoon? Don't you need to let Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan take a day off?"
　　 Cao Fenglin looked at the two of them and said, "Neither of them use skills, so what are you going to take a break? That's it!"
　　 Mo Xiu sighed, Cao Fenglin deserves to be Cao Fenglin, always in such a hurry.
　　 Normally the 15-day trial within the department, other departments will take about ten days to produce results, right?
　　 The support system is good. Today is July 20th. The final is on the fifth day. In the remaining ten days, it is estimated that Cao Fenglin will disappear and be lazy again.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo had been waiting outside the door, and when Mo Xiu came out, he immediately greeted him.
　　 "Mo Xiu, how is it? Did you win?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded and said, "Can I not win against Dongfang? Also, the final will be played in the afternoon."
　　 Yang Qingzhuo said with a worried look: "Mo Xiu, you have to come on, don't let others take me away!"
　　 Based on the current rumours in the city, it is estimated that no one except Mo Xiu would choose Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 Nothing happened at noon, and a few people returned to the training ground after eating.
　　Because all the classmates in the promotion competition in the department came, there was a lot of voice at this time, and the classmates were discussing in groups.
　　 Discuss who will win the championship, and Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan will choose who to join the team competition.
　　 As soon as Mo Xiu came in, the whole audience was quiet, and the girls who had scolded Mo Xiu before were no longer disgusted.
　　 A few girls even scratched their heads in front of Mo Xiu, trying to attract Mo Xiu's attention.
　　 What if Mo Xiu chooses them to join his team? Wouldn't it be that I entered the school competition, with this kind of results, it is easy to find a job in the future.
　　 Mo Xiu ignored them at all and walked straight to the center of the venue.
　　 Some girls who couldn’t see it said: “I’m really shameless. I want to seduce Mo Xiu without seeing what I look like? Does Yang Qingzhuo look good?”
　　 Time is approaching, Cao Fenglin and Mu Mu also came to the venue.
　　 Cao Fenglin picked up his loudspeaker again and said, "Everyone is quiet, Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan are in!"
　　 Mo Xiu has been standing in the center of the field, UU reading www.uukanshu.com Xiao Lan didn't know where he got out.
　　 Xiao Lan clasped his fists and said to Mo Xiu: "Hello, I have heard that you are good for a long time, and I can finally fight you today."
　　 He lowered his head as he spoke, and was obviously embarrassed. No matter how Mo Xiu looked at Xiao Lan, he looked like a little girl. It was a far cry from her elder sister Xiao Hong. The younger sister is so well-behaved.
　　 Mo Xiu replied: "Happy meeting!"
　　 Cao Fenglin said: "The game begins!"
　　 Mo Xiu didn't expect Cao Fenglin to start calling so quickly. This is the final. Don't you need to mobilize the audience's atmosphere?
After 　　, Mo Xiu remembered that it was Cao Fenglin, not the host of the underground arena.
　　 Mo Xiu immediately activated God's spy.
　　"One skill: Mysterious Blue Flame 3
Skill effect: The caster has three blue flames entwining the whole body. Each blue flame can increase speed by 100%, attack power by 100%, and defense power by 100%. When attacked, it can control the blue flame to resist and defend against blue flame. The power is five times that of the spell being cast.
　　 Blue Flame can be thrown to cause area damage, and cannot be recovered after being thrown.
　　 Duration: fifteen minutes
　　Cooling time: one hour"
　　 Mo Xiu almost yelled after reading it. There were three blue flames in the third level skill, which means to increase the attack power, defense power and speed by 300%.
　　 This is the first time that Mo Xiu has seen a skill comparable to that of Valkyrie's Arrival, which is more pure, enhances all attributes, and is a pure warrior skill.
　　 The mysterious blue flame is all-encompassing, enhancing attributes, enhancing defense, elemental damage, and can be applied to other people.
　　 Mo Xiu took a deep breath, knowing that this time, he might not win!
    
   


　　 Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan both knew each other's greatness, without any care, both of them activated their skills as soon as possible.
　　 Three blue flames appeared around Xiao Lan, and the flames were moving irregularly.
　　 The two seem to have some tacit understanding, and they attacked at the same time.
　　 Mo Xiu launched a thunderous blow while Xiao Lan was still rushing forward and not standing still.
　　 Without a trace of panic, Xiao Lan raised his right arm in front of him.
　　 The blue flame also moved quickly to Xiao Lan's arm.
　　 Mo Xiu's punch happened to hit the flames. After realizing this, Mo Xiu immediately retracted his fist and took a step back.
　　 After looking at the fist, there was no burning sensation as imagined. The blue flame was like no temperature, unlike Wang Lei's flame armor, accompanied by high temperature.
　　 But the defensive power is really amazing. Mo Xiu didn't break the defense with this punch. It seems that if he wants to defeat Xiao Lan, he must avoid the blue flames.
　　 But Xiao Lan's fighting style is very similar to Mo Xiu's, they are both minimalist moves, without revealing a trace of flaws.
　　 Every time he touched him, Xiao Lan would still use Lan Yan to block it. After a long time, it turned out that Mo Xiu consumed more.
　　 Xiao Lan would often block attacks with blue flames, freeing his hands to counterattack.
　　 What shocked Mo Xiu the most was that according to estimates, Xiao Lan's basic physical fitness should be better than himself.
　　 This is unbelievable, a little girl has such a strong body.
　　 After adjusting to a period of time, Xiao Lan completely controlled the three flame defenses and let go of his hands and kept attacking.
　　 This is equivalent to Xiao Lan having five hands, and the speed and strength of the two are about the same. As a result, Mo Xiu was instantly at a disadvantage.
　　 Mo Xiu felt that his attack methods were too monotonous now, and he relied entirely on melee combat. In this way, once he could break through the opponent's defense, he would be helpless.
　　 I have never met such a person before, but now he has appeared.
　　 Mo Xiu frowned, thinking about how to defeat Xiao Lan.
　　 Regardless of the consumption or the duration of the skill, Mo Xiu is inferior to Xiao Lan. If this continues, he will only lose.
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at the audience, his eyes lit up, and he continued to attack with a smile.
　　 This time Mo Xiu put out both fists, and Xiao Lan used two flames to block Mo Xiu's attack as before.
　　 Xiao Lan hit back with a punch, and Mo Xiu made an extremely weird move. With a flick of his left arm, he entangled Xiao Lan's attacking arm, using this method to defuse the attack.
　　 Xiao Lan saw that his arm was entangled, and immediately withdrew it.
　　 At the same time, Mo Xiu did not retract his hands, but continued to move, changing direction, changing his left fist to attack the gate, and his right fist went straight to his lower abdomen.
　　 Xiao Lan didn't expect Mo Xiu to change his attacking style. The blue flame moved quickly, blocking Mo Xiu's left fist hitting his face, but failed to prevent Mo Xiu's right fist.
　　 Mo Xiu's right fist struck Xiao Lan's lower abdomen with a second force in the air. This was also Mo Xiu's first successful attack.
　　 Xiao Lan backed a few steps before stopping, fixedly looking at Mo Xiu.
　　 "Do you use Hu Jiaquan?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded. When he just looked at the audience, he happened to see Hu Xianming.
　　 Xiao Lan frowned tightly and said, "What is your relationship with the Hu family? How can you get Hu Jiaquan?"
　　 Mo Xiu reached out to Hu Xianming off the court and said, "She taught me!"
　　 Xiao Lan looked at Hu Xianming suspiciously, wondering why he should teach Mo Xiu boxing.
　　 Hu Xianming stomped angrily off the court. This Mo Xiu was just nonsense. He secretly learned his own boxing technique, and even said that I taught him!
　　 Mo Xiu didn't give Xiao Lan too much time to react. After all, the longer the delay, the more disadvantaged it would be for Mo Xiu.
　　 Fighting again, Mo Xiu became more proficient than before, and quickly wrapped Xiao Lan.
　　 If Hu Xianming's boxing technique is chasing after each other, like two tracking missiles, then Mo Xiu's boxing technique is more like two snakes.
　　 Both arms are flexible, like two snakes. As long as Xiao Lan punches, his arms will be entangled. Both fists are like the sharp teeth of a fierce snake, constantly attacking Xiao Lan's weakness.
　　 In this way, the situation on the field reverses, Mo Xiu has the upper hand, and Xiao Lan? In disadvantage.
　　 Everyone present had different ideas, and Mo Xiu finally found a way to defeat Xiao Lan, very happy.
　　 Xiao Lan is very annoying. She has never seen such a nasty boxing technique, which makes her feel that she cannot use it.
　　 Hu Xianming was lost in thought. The boxing method Mo Xiu used at this time was no longer the Hujia boxing method. It was a variant, which further amplified the pursuit of the Hujia boxing method and became more sticky and capable of both attacking and accepting.
　　 weakened the second stage of the force, only when it is determined that it can hit the opponent, then the second stage of the force is used to ensure the attack power. Mo Xiu's grasp of the timing is like a monster.
　　 It is not so much that Mo Xiu learned Hu Jiaquan wrong, it is better to say that Mo Xiu sublimated Hu Jiaquan to make it more powerful and difficult.
　　 Thinking of this, Hu Xianming didn't care so much, and immediately ran out of the door and dialed his father's number.
　　 Cao Fenglin nodded slightly, and felt that Mo Xiu was not a simple person. Skills are the talent that determines the upper limit of a person. Isn't it the combat talent?
　　 But the audience at this time has different ideas from these people. It is the so-called expert watching the doorway and the layman watching the excitement. This is the auxiliary department. Most people do not know martial arts and are not very good at fighting.
　　 Now in their opinion, Mo Xiu's sticky style with a lot of physical contact is clearly a gain in cash.
　　 But now, no one dared to call Mo Xiu a scumbag. In case Mo Xiu is offended, Mo Xiu will not consider himself when he chooses his teammates. At least there is still a chance.
　　 In the field, after this period of confrontation, Xiao Lan was injured all over his body. Fortunately, Mo Xiu's style of play was unable to exert his full strength, and Xiao Lan was not injured seriously either.
　　 But even so, Xiao Lan's exhaustion was very heavy, and he couldn't hold on to his physical strength. If you continue to fight like this, you will be defeated in less than a minute.
　　 And the more Mo Xiu arrived at this time, the more vigilant he became, because Xiao Lan still had assassins that were useless.
　　 Xiaolan’s blue flame can be launched, causing elemental damage.
　　 So Mo Xiu is now staring at the three flames, ready to dodge at any time.
　　 Because of Mo Xiu's distraction, the offense has become less sharp than before.
　　 What Mo Xiu did not expect was that after a minute, Xiao Lan gave in.
　　 Xiao Lan raised his right hand and said to Cao Fenglin: "Teacher, I give up!"
　　 Mo Xiu felt very disappointed, why did he give up at this time, Xiao Lan clearly still has a hole card.
　　 Cao Fenglin was also taken aback for a while and said: "Okay, this time the champion of the final has appeared, and Mo Xiu will win!"
　　 Mo Xiu asked puzzledly: "Why did you give up? You can hold on for a while."
　　 Xiao Lan smiled and said gracefully: "I will lose again if I fight again. It is unnecessary. I admit that you are not as good as you. You are very powerful."
　　 Mo Xiu was still a little unwilling to say: "But how do you know that if you hold on, my skills will not enter the cooling time?"
　　 Xiao Lan asked back: "Then how do you know that my skills will not enter the cooling down before you? You won, Mo Xiu, congratulations!"
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head and sighed. For some reason, Xiao Lan didn't use his killer mace, so he willingly gave in.
　　 During the dialogue between the two, Yang Qingzhuo, He Lingyue and Dong Fang rushed into the arena to celebrate Mo Xiu's winning the championship.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo grabbed the corner of Mo Xiu's clothes and said, "Mo Xiu, can you be the first to choose me in a while?"
　　 Mo Xiu saw Yang Qingzhuo's appearance and unconsciously touched Yang Qingzhuo's head with his hand.
　　 "Okay! The first one to choose you!"
　　

 
       
 
           


　　 "Okay, you are the first one to choose!"
　　 The game ended, there was no cheers of the mountains and the tsunami, but the audience was quiet.
　　 Because what everyone cares most is not who is the champion, but who Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan will choose to be their teammates.
　　 Cao Fenglin and Mu Mu walked to the center of the court, and Mu Mu said to Mo Xiu: "Mo Xiu, you are the champion. You can choose your four teammates first."
　　 Mo Xiu nodded, the audience was silent, everyone was afraid to miss their name.
　　 "Yang Qingzhuo!"
　　 The little follower jumped up excitedly when she heard her name. If there were not too many people on the scene, she would have liked to kiss Mo Xiu.
　　 It's no surprise that Mo Xiu chooses Yang Qingzhuo, after all, that "Mo Xiu!" Awesome! The picture of ’is now a household name.
　　 "He Lingyue!"
　　 Mo Xiu chose her according to the agreement with He Lingyue, not purely on friendship, He Lingyue’s skill ‘Future Man’ is indeed very strong as a support.
　　 "Dong Fang!"
　　 The reason why Mo Xiu chose Dong Fang is very simple. It is difficult to find a strong offensive system in the auxiliary system, and too many auxiliary systems are not strong.
　　 The last place left, the audience held their breath.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Xiao Lan and said, "I'm sorry."
　　 Xiao Lan didn't understand what Mo Xiu meant at first, but was stunned when he heard Mo Xiu's last name.
　　 "Hu Xianming!"
　　 Even Xiao Lan was a little unhappy, and Mo Xiu's stab in such a sideline was simply a favorite.
　　 At this time, Hu Xianming had just finished the phone call and heard his name when he returned to the stadium.
　　 reacted a little, and stood behind Mo Xiu like Yang Qingzhuo, He Lingyue, and Dong Fang.
After 　　 Mo Xiu chose, Xiao Lan also began to select his own players.
　　 The process was also very fast, and it seemed that Xiao Lan had already decided before.
　　 It wasn't until this time that Mo Xiu realized that the few people Xiao Lan chose didn't know him.
　　After thinking about it carefully, I realized that Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan advanced in two lines. All Mo Xiu chose were people he knew, or people he met in the game.
The same is true for Xiao Lan. In other words, the seemingly unreasonable schedule is to efficiently select the four strongest of all people, and then form a team with the two strongest as the core. The core selections are all beneficial to him or People who cooperate with tacit understanding.
　　 Thinking of this, Mo Xiu couldn't help but look carefully at Cao Fenglin. This man who seems to be casual in everything should have great wisdom.
　　Mu saw that Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan had both selected their teammates and announced the promotion list again.
　　 then said to Mo Xiu: "Mo Xiu, your championship reward will be delivered to your dormitory at night."
　　 Mo Xiu nodded in response, and at this point, the department trial came to an end.
　　 There was a sigh on the spot, and everyone felt sorry for not being promoted.
　　 Cao Fenglin said: "There are still ten days left in the selection competition within the department, and all the rest will be selected for the second time in the next room!"
　　 Mo Xiu didn't understand, the list of promotion has already come out, how could there be a second selection based on Cao Fenglin's character?
Cao Fenglin looked at everyone's puzzled appearance, and continued: "You all forgot, each team can have eight people, five main players and three substitutes. The second selection will select a total of six substitutes from the others. Don't relax. At Yenching University, as long as there is a little slack, it will fall behind."
After 　　, Cao Fenglin said some precautions. After leaving all those who were promoted, everyone else left.
　　 There are only Cao Fenglin and Mu Mu left in the stadium, and ten people who have been promoted.
　　 Cao Fenglin said to everyone: "For the next ten days, you will come here to train every morning to prepare for the school's civil war. The training is hosted by Mumu. I have told Mumu about all the training methods."
　　 Dong Fang asked carelessly: "Teacher, Mu Mu trained us, why are you going?"
　　 Cao Fenglin pointed to Dong Fang and said, "What am I doing? I have to choose a substitute for you."
　　 Cao Fenglin left after speaking, and Mu Mu stayed behind to talk to a few people.
　　Mo Xiu was a little bit emotional, and Mu Mu was transformed into an instructor.
　　 Mumu briefly said the precautions and announced the time of all games.
　　 Mo Xiu listed the school competitions and club competitions together. It seems that the next time will be busy.
　　 On August 1, the preliminaries of the school individual heads-up competition.
　　 On August 15th, the preliminaries of the individual club heads-up competition.
　　 September 1, the preliminaries of the school team competition.
　　 September 15, the preliminaries of the club team competition.
　　 On October 1st, the club heads-up competition.
　　 November 1st, the school heads-up competition.
　　 December 1st, club team competition.
　　 January 1st, the school team competition.
　　The competition will last until January next year. It is estimated that it will be the competitions of major colleges and universities. In this way, the competition will run through the whole year, and the competition education of Yenching University is really not in vain.
　　 Looking at it overall, the competition is dominated by school civil wars, and community battles are more like the usual competitions that use all the free time and then start.
　　 It was night after Mumu's explanation, and Mo Xiu returned to the dormitory after a bite of dinner.
　　 When he returned to the dormitory, he found that someone had brought Qingxinmu to him and was waiting at the door.
　　 Mo Xiu greeted him, opened the door and asked the staff to help put Qingxinmu in his room.
　　 The staff left, and Dong Fang helped to open the big box in front of him.
　　 Pure Heart Tree is like a small tree without roots. Its trunk is about 30 centimeters in diameter and about 1.5 meters high. It is shaped like a coconut tree.
　　 Before Mo Xiu came forward to check, a black shadow passed by Mo Xiu and hugged Qingxinmu.
　　 Take a closer look, it turned out to be Yang Qingzhuo. Yang Qingzhuo didn't go back to his dormitory, but secretly followed up with Mo Xiu's dormitory, just to take a look at this Qingxinmu.
　　 Mo Xiu walked within one meter of Qingxinmu~www.mtlnovel.com~ suddenly felt refreshed, his brain became clearer, and he felt like a **** of war came.
　　 Mo Xiu tugged Yang Qingzhuo, who was holding Qingxinmu, and said, "Little jerk, please leave. If you like it, I will lend you Qingxinmu for a few days."
　　 But no matter what Mo Xiu said, Yang Qingzhuo just didn't want to let go. Mo Xiu had no choice but to leave it to her.
　　 After another hour, Mo Xiu was about to go to sleep, and could no longer let Yang Qingzhuo stay.
　　 Mo Xiu used strong means to tear Yang Qing Zhuosheng from under the Qingxinmu.
　　 dragged to the door, Yang Qingzhuo said angrily: "Mo Xiu, you are so stingy, I'm all yours, and I won't be able to stay with you for a while!"
　　 Mo Xiu grabbed the clothes on the back of Yang Qingzhuo's neck with one hand and directly lifted it up.
　　 "Don't talk nonsense, when did you become my one?"
　　 When Yang Qingzhuo heard this, teardrops appeared in his eyes immediately. His big watery eyes and a circle of teardrops were extremely pitiful.
　　 Mo Xiu said helplessly: "Well, can't you be my one? Come here during the day and you have to go back to the dormitory to sleep at night, don't you know?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo was still a little wronged, nodded unwillingly, and then Mo Xiu put her down.
　　 turned around and opened the door, frightening Mo Xiu.
　　 An old face looked at Mo Xiu expressionlessly, Mo Xiu almost ran into him just now.
　　 This person is the uncle downstairs. It seems that he has been standing here for a long time, that is to say, he has heard all the words just said through a door.
　　 Mo Xiu asked awkwardly: "Master, why are you here?"
　　 The uncle snorted coldly: "You brought the female doll into your dormitory for so long, and you still asked me why I came here?"

　　 Mo Xiu said, "Master, I got a pure heart tree today. This little guy wants to come and have a look, nothing else."
　　 Mo Xiu also dragged Liu Qingzhuo towards the door.
　　 The uncle looked at the two of them, and he didn't look like someone who did anything extraordinary.
　　 "Are you the champion of the auxiliary department?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded.
　　 "Who is in charge of the auxiliary department this time?"
　　 Mo Xiu replied: "It's Teacher Cao Fenglin."
　　 Uncle said in surprise: "Cao Fenglin?"
　　 Mo Xiu didn't understand why the uncle was so surprised, so he nodded again.
After 　　, the uncle asked about Cao Fenglin's selection method and follow-up arrangements.
When Mo Xiu finished speaking, the uncle nodded and said: "Well, yes, it seems that this year's auxiliary department is very strong. If I were you, I would rent a house outside the school and gather all your partners together. ."
　　 Mo Xiu suddenly felt that the idea was feasible, but the financial resources were not enough now, so he bid farewell to the uncle and Yang Qingzhuo, and Mo Xiu went back to the room to sleep.
　　 In the early morning of the next day, Mo Xiu felt refreshed after getting up. He looked at the Qingxinmu next to him, and it was really useful.
　　 Pure Heart Wood will grow continuously, mainly by absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy and slowly growing, transforming it into useful spiritual power and releasing it.
　　 Mo Xiu touched the trunk of Xinmu, and Qingxinmu radiated a very faint light, as if responding.
　　 No. 3 martial arts venue.
　　 The promoted teams Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan arrived here on time.
　　 Mumu has been waiting here for a long time.
　　 Seeing the crowd arrived, Mu Mu took out a folder and opened it, then closed it.
　　 "Dear fellow students, my fighting ability is not as good as yours, but Teacher Cao Fenglin said that I have the talent to be a teacher. I may help you train for the next ten days. Please advise."
　　 Mu Mu bowed, and there was humility between his actions and words.
　　Everyone is very familiar with Mu Mu, and of course they will not be uncooperative because Mu Mu is a classmate of the same class.
　　According to Mo Xiu's observation, Mumu skills are somewhat similar to He Lingyue, but not as perverted as the "Future Man". It is estimated that they are investigative skills that can see through the weaknesses of others, and are suitable for coaching.
　　 Mo Xiu is the champion of the auxiliary department, and he has the most voice among all people. Mu Mu is an old classmate. Of course he supported him at this time.
　　 "Directed by Mu, we believe in your ability, and talk about our training today."
　　 Mumu smiled at Mo Xiu and nodded, understanding Mo Xiu's kindness.
　　 "The training arrangement in the future will be like this. Actual training will be conducted in the morning, and special intensive training will be conducted in the afternoon. Since today is the first day, we will give everyone the time to adapt. Only the actual training will be conducted in the morning."
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "How do we actually fight?"
　　 "It's very simple. Team Moxiu is playing against Xiao Lan. The players are your own choice. Let's take a look at your level of understanding today."
　　 Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan glanced at each other, and the second duel was about to take place so soon.
　　 "The rules of the game are very simple. The field is 100 meters square. If you go out of the circle or lose combat power, it is eliminated. In the end, there is no opponent to win. That is the regular rules of the game. Now I will give you half an hour to discuss tactics."
　　 When discussing tactics, a very strange scene appeared.
　　 Xiao Lan's five people discussed very intensely. Many people made suggestions and looked at Mo Xiu from time to time. It seemed that there were several plans.
On Mo Xiu’s side, the opposite was true. Mo Xiu summoned the other four people and said only one sentence. The others nodded. After that, the five people sat quietly, some playing with mobile phones, and some looking at Xiao Lan’s side. movement.
　　Mo Xiu went too far, and just sat down, closed his eyes, and closed his eyes to rest.
　　 Xiao Lan's team gets more angry the more they look, isn't this to belittle them? Instead, the tactics were discussed more intensely, wanting to defeat the Moxiu team.
　　 Time flies, half an hour passed quickly, and Mu Mu announced the start of the game.
 "Game start!"
　　 As soon as the voice fell, Mo Xiu opened his eyes and soon entered a fighting state.
　　 Mo Xiu's team fought in a row with five people, no rules.
　　 Looking back at Xiao Lan's team, Xiao Lan stood at the forefront, with two people standing in the middle, and two more people standing at the end. Obviously, it was carefully designed.
　　 At the beginning of the game, Xiao Lan didn't make any moves. Except for Xiao Lan's release of the skills, everyone else was waiting for the opportunity to respond to the changes.
　　 The Mo Xiu team was simple and rude. Three rays of light appeared directly on Mo Xiu's body. The coming of his own Valkyrie, Yang Qingzhuo's speed, and He Lingyue's future were all blessed on Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu felt an unprecedented strength and directly launched a thunderous blow.
　　 Xiao Lan originally thought that Mo Xiu would find herself directly, but she didn't expect Mo Xiu to use her speed advantage to jump over her directly and go straight to the four people behind.
　　 Xiao Lan knew that something was wrong, and immediately turned around to pursue it, but then a figure appeared in front of him.
　　 Dong Fang...
　　 As the meat shield of Mo Xiu's team, Dong Fang stood in front of Xiao Lan of course.
　　 Xiao Lan ignored it, and wanted to get rid of Dong Fang by speed, but didn't expect that the big guy Dong Fang could keep up with him.
　　 This is actually the reason why Yang Qingzhuo released Dong Fang so quickly.
　　 Xiao Lan couldn't get rid of Dong Fang, so he could only defeat him. Even if Dong Fang was meat, he wouldn't be Xiao Lan's opponent.
　　 After the two moves, Xiao Lan thought that he could defeat Dong Fang, and just as he was about to injure Dong Fang, a white light appeared on Dong Fang's body, offsetting the damage.
　　 Xiao Lan couldn't be more familiar with this skill, this was Hu Xianming's holy light.
　　 Xiao Lan looked back at Hu Xianming, who was looking at her apologetically.
　　With Hu Xianming's skills, Xiao Lan knew that he could not defeat Dong Fang in a short time, so he made a decisive decision and turned around to attack He Lingyue, Yang Qingzhuo, and Hu Xianming.
　　 You cut my back row, and I cut your back row too.
　　 Xiao Lan moved very quickly, Dong Fang didn't even react, he turned around and ran to ~www.mtlnovel.com~ Just as Xiao Lan was about to attack the weakest He Lingyue, a figure flashed and stood in front of Xiao Lan.
　　Mo Xiu!
　　 is Mo Xiu!
　　 Xiao Lan is unbelievable, why did Mo Xiu come back? Is it?
　　 Looking back, Xiao Lan's four teammates were all out, and all of them looked at Xiao Lan with regret.
　　 Xiao Lan turned his head and looked at Mo Xiu incredulously. Just now, his team had clearly arranged a complete tactic, how could it be easily defeated by Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't do it directly, but asked, "Do you want to continue?"
　　 Xiao Lan decisively gave in. Under normal circumstances, she would not necessarily be an opponent. Now Mo Xiu is still in various states and it is impossible to win.
　　 Mumu clapped on the side and said: "A wonderful game, Team Mo Xiu won."
After 　　, Mu Mu made a summary of the game.
"The Xiao Lan team has too many worries. When an accident happened, everyone did not make the most correct response. When Mo Xiu rushed over by himself just now, you should immediately shrink the lineup and use five to one. Such a good formation."
　　 "The members of the Moxiu team obviously have a lot of tacit understanding. Everyone knows when to do something. Although the tactics are simple, they are concise and effective."
　　 A member of the Xiaolan team asked unwillingly: "Mo Xiu, your team has no tactics, why do you cooperate so tacitly."
　　 Mo Xiu spread his hands and said, "Who said we don't have tactics? I have tactics."
　　 The five members of Xiaolan team and Mu Mu looked at Mo Xiu. When the tactics were set up just now, Mo Xiu obviously only said a word.
　　 Mo Xiu stretched out three fingers and said, "Our tactics are only three words!"
　　 Everyone is puzzled.
　　 "Four guarantees and one!"

　　 After the morning training was over, Mo Xiu called Liu Ziyang to the dormitory at noon.
　　 Liu Ziyang asked as soon as he entered the door: "Boss! What's the matter? What's the matter with me?"
　　 Mo Xiu took Liu Ziyang's to his bedroom, pointed to Qing Xinmu and said, "This is the reward of our department champion!"
　　 Liu Ziyang looked around and said: "Boss, I knew you won the championship last night, but I didn't have time to call you, so just give it to the champion?"
　　 "Uh...Yes!"
　　 "I thought it was a good thing? Just this stuff, I sleep on my pillow every night!"
　　Mo Xiu almost forgot that Liu Ziyang grew up with a golden spoon in his hand and has endless resources since he was a child.
　　 But it’s hard for Liu Ziyang. He grew up resting on Qingxinmu and his IQ was so high.
　　 Mo Xiu asked strangely: "By the way, since your family is so capable, how can your skills reach the second level?"
　　 Liu Ziyang touched his head and said: "It's not because of my dad. My dad said that it is best not to use drugs to improve skills. Even if the skill level is improved, the understanding of skills will not be in place."
　　 Mo Xiu nodded, Liu Ziyang's father said it was very reasonable, the understanding of skills is very important.
　　 Liu Ziyang asked: "Boss, what do you want to do when you come to me? Isn't it the pure heart tree that shows you? You are not that kind of person."
　　 Mo Xiu asked Liu Ziyang to sit down and said slowly.
　　 "Actually I want to ask you something."
  "what's up?"
　　 "What is the origin of the Xiao family? Xiao Hong, Xiao Lan, and Xiao Qing who I pretended last time."
　　 Liu Ziyang looked serious when he heard this question.
　　 "Boss, I can tell you about this, but it's important, so you can't tell others."
　　 Mo Xiu patted his chest and said, "Don't worry, don't you worry about me?"
　　 "In fact, the Xiao family is a royal family!"
　　 "Royal family?!!!"
　　Mo Xiu was shocked. This was the first time he had come into contact with the royal family. He had only heard of it before, and it was rarely mentioned in books.
　　 There is another reason why Mo Xiu cares about the royal family so much, that is, the royal family has talent skills!
　　 Liu Ziyang widened his eyes and covered Mo Xiu's mouth and said, "Boss, keep your voice down. It's nothing to discuss the royal family, but things about the royal family are basically secrets, and only a few people know it!"
　　 Mo Xiu patted Liu Ziyang's hand and said, "Okay, you can tell me more specifically!"
　　 "Well, the Xiao family is a royal family, but it is also a desolate royal family, otherwise the royal family will not come to Yanjing University to study."
　　 "Royal family? Lost?"
　　 Mo Xiu is puzzled, how can the royal family be down?
　　 "Yes, the second generation of the Xiao family, that is, Xiao Hong's father does not have strong skills, so he is down."
　　 Mo Xiu nodded and said, "But I think Xiao Hong and Xiao Lan are both very talented!"
"Yes, the third generation of the Xiao family has a total of three people, the eldest sister Xiao Hong, the second sister Xiao Lan, and the third brother Xiao Qing. Except for Xiao Qing's unlearning and skillless, both sisters are very strong, especially Xiao Hong, who wants to revive. Xiao family."
　　 Mo Xiu is clear, so that you can understand why Xiao Lan's skills are so perverted, and why the combat routines are military-style.
　　 "Tell me more specifically!"
"Boss, how specific is it? Check your account? Do you like these two sisters? As a brother, I have to advise you, you have to be more restrained, you have Mu Qingyi, and now you have Yang Qingzhuo, you still want Xiao..."
　　 Mo Xiu stretched out his right hand helplessly to interrupt Liu Ziyang.
　　 "Well, I don't want to know about the Xiao family, I want to know about the royal family, I am very interested!"
　　 Liu Ziyang's eyes lit up when he heard this, then he lowered his head and closed his mouth tightly.
　　 is like a child who knows some gossip, but knows that he can't easily spread it out.
　　 Mo Xiu's eyes moved and said, "Just tell me, even if you don't tell me, have you forgotten the relationship between me and Don? I will ask him then, and he will tell me, but I can't find him now."
　　 Liu Ziyang suddenly let go of his guard.
　　 "Okay, let me tell you, the origin of the royal family is absolutely unexpected!"
　　 "The royal family's surname is Xiao?"
　　 "No! The royal family does not have a fixed surname. The royal family is not one family, but consists of many families..."
　　 In the next hour, Liu Ziyang explained the royal family from all aspects. Mo Xiu was shocked. The royal family has always represented the strongest fighting power of the alliance, but no matter how you think about it, you can't think of the truth of the royal family.
　　Everything originated from the meteorite "Haji", so after "Si" came to the world, which generation of people has been favored by "Haji" the most?
　　 is the person who has lived in the era of aura explosion since childhood?
　　 or the people who were irradiated when ‘Shi’ came to people’s homes, that generation was called ‘Chodai’, and is ‘Chodai’ the strongest existence?
　　 Not at all, Liu Ziyang said a concept that shocked Mo Xiu, that is, "Shengzi"!
　　 The so-called "Holy Son" is actually very easy to understand. It is the baby who was still in the mother's belly when "Shi" came.
　　 They were blessed, experienced the first radiation, and grew up in the Reiki Age. They are like the people that Hajime brought to the earth.
At the beginning, the countries did not know and were caught in a bitter battle with the wild beasts, but when the generation of the'Holy Son' reached the age of 18, when the awakening skills, all talents knew that if they wanted to repel the wild beasts and preserve the human domain, they had to rely they.
　　 That generation was gathered and protected with special protection. Until they grew up, they repelled all the beasts and signed contracts.
　　 However, due to human care, the Beast discovered the existence of the "Holy Son" during the period. The Beast used a spy to launch a sneak attack, and the "Holy Son" was killed and injured more than half!
　　 During the Great War, another part of the "Holy Son" fell, and the remaining "Holy Son" and his descendants were called the royal family~www.mtlnovel.com~ Until now, the royal family is the core and strongest fighting power of the alliance.
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "I heard Don't say that some royals have talent skills, do you know?"
　　 Liu Ziyang nodded and said: "I also heard my grandfather say, but I have never seen it before. I don't know what talent skills are."
　　 Mo Xiu fell into deep thought, is it true that his passive skill flipping is really a talent skill of the royal family?
　　 But since I was a poor boy, what does it have to do with the royal family?
　　 "Boss! Boss!!!"
　　 Liu Ziyang pulled Mo Xiu back from his thoughts.
　　 "Huh? Where are we talking?"
　　 "We're done, you are so weird today."
　　 Mo Xiu smiled indifferently: "Okay, you go back first, thank you for solving my happy doubts."
　　 Just like that, Liu Ziyang came here inexplicably, and then left inexplicably. When he left, he didn't figure out what Mo Xiu was looking for.
　　 After bidding farewell to Liu Ziyang, Mo Xiu sat alone under the Pure Heart Tree and thought.
　　What does he have to do with the royal family? Is it the missing father? But Mo Xiu didn't want to mention this to his mother.
　　 Because every time the father is mentioned, the mother Li Yuan will be very painful.
In any case, it wouldn’t be a bad thing to have a god-level skill like flip. If nothing happens, Mo Xiu will have eight skills after all awakening, which is four more skills than normal people. This is definitely a terrifying existence. .
　　 I don’t know what other royal family’s talent skills are? Is it so powerful?
　　 By the way, when I checked Xiao Lan before, I didn't see the talent skills? Is there a genetic problem? ? ?
　　

    
   


　　 Mo Xiu was still in a daze, the door was knocked.
　　 After opening the door, Mo Xiu was shocked. It turned out to be his cheap master Tang, which is faster than Cao Cao!
　　 "Master...Master, how did you find me?"
　　 Elder Don pushed Mo Xiu away and walked directly into the dormitory to look around for a week.
　　 "You can't do this dormitory, let's go out and rent a room by yourself."
　　 Mo Xiu said awkwardly: "I am a little tight at the moment, Master, do you think otherwise..."
　　 Elder Tang gave Mo Xiu a roll of eyes. This apprentice was really difficult, and he wanted to bleed again the second time he met.
　　 Tang Lao punched Mo Xiu on the forehead, and Mo Xiu squatted on the ground in pain.
　　 "Oh, sir, what are you doing?"
　　 "Buddy, I came here like blackmailing me! But it doesn't matter, I have prepared the house for you, I have a villa in Yanjing, empty or empty, let you live in it."
　　 Elder Tang threw a file bag to Mo Xiu as he said.
　　 "Here are the keys and the transfer documents. I have asked someone to do it for you. You can move in directly!"
　　 Mo Xiu smiled suddenly because of the bitter face he was beaten up just now.
　　 said with a thumbs up: "The master is so thoughtful! I didn't expect the master to care about the apprentice all the time, the apprentice is grateful!"
　　 Old Tang held back a smile and said, "Stop being flattered here, you can move over to me immediately, I have something to entrust to you!"
　　 Mo Xiu was taken aback, the old man seemed not so kind.
 "what?"
　　 "You will tell you when you move in. Move faster. I will come to the villa to look for you at night."
　　 After talking about Don’s leaving, Mo Xiu hurriedly stopped Don and said, "Ah, sir, can I let others live in that villa?"
　　 Elder Tang touched his beard with his right hand, and he seemed to be thinking hard.
　　 "Yes! But he must be a trustworthy person, understand?"
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Mr. Tang’s serious expression, immediately put away his smile, and replied seriously: "Yes, I understand."
　　 Old Tang left, Mo Xiu actually understood in his mouth, but actually didn’t understand very much, why should a trustworthy person be able to move in a villa?
　　 can't figure it out, this cheap master has always given Mo Xiu a mysterious feeling.
　　 don't know the identity, don't know the purpose of accepting disciples, don't even know whereabouts.
　　 But no matter what, the master still took good care of Mo Xiu, and took Mo Xiu into the universe cram school and gave him Hei Lin and the villa.
　　 Although I didn't do what the master should do, but gave what the master should give.
　　 Master had already given the order to die, and Mo Xiu didn't dare not follow it, so he could only move immediately and start moving.
　　 Moving this kind of work requires a big car to load things, and everything else is easy to say, it's that Qingxinmu is not easy to move, and ordinary cars can't fit them.
　　 Mo Xiu dialed Liu Ziyang's phone directly.
　　 "Hello? Boss, what's the matter? You don't want to talk to me again, right?"
　　 "No, I want to move, can you arrange it for me?"
　　 "Where do you move?"
　　 "Wait a minute, let me see..."
　　 Mo Xiu opened the bag Don gave him and read the address on it.
　　 "Yunding Villa District, 18 floors, 15 buildings."
　　 "Huh?? Boss, you didn't kid me? It's really the Genting Villa area? The 18th floor?"
　　 Mo Xiu looked at it carefully again and said, "It's not wrong!"
　　 Mo Xiu heard Liu Ziyang take a deep breath on the other side of the phone.
　　 "Hi! Whoo! How did this villa come from?"
　　 Mo Xiu answered truthfully: "Master gave it to you!"
　　 "Master?"
　　 "Old Don!"
　　 "Fuck me!!"
　　...
　　 Until the evening, Mo Xiu did not finish moving, and Liu Ziyang kept busy.
　　 When Mo Xiu came to the Genting Villa area and saw the spectacular scene, he understood why Liu Ziyang was surprised.
　　The entire villa area is built on the mountain, with one floor at the foot of the mountain and 18 floors at the top of the mountain.
　　 Liu Ziyang's family lives on the 16th floor here, so they are very familiar with it, and there are security personnel on each floor.
　　According to Liu Ziyang, the villa here cannot be bought with money. The higher the floor, the higher the identity.
　　 Even with the power of the Liu family, he can only live on the 16th floor, because the entire 17th floor is occupied by the royal family's relatives.
　　 The elevator goes straight to the eighteenth floor. Mo Xiu feels that this place is like a paradise, peaceful and quiet. Because it is on the top of the mountain, you can see clouds within reach when you look up.
　　 Liu Ziyang also came up for the first time, and he seemed a little overwhelmed and kept taking pictures.
　　 "Liu Ziyang, what are you doing taking pictures?"
　　 Liu Ziyang said with a smug look: "Boss, you don't understand this. I can boast about these photos for three days and three nights in the circle, otherwise I will be awesome when I take you to a party next time."
　　 Mo Xiu naturally understood that the circle Liu Ziyang was talking about must be the circle of the children of the rich family.
　　 "Forget it, I'm not interested."
　　 Liu Ziyang was not disappointed by Mo Xiu's words, and continued to take selfies.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Liu Ziyang, I have been in Yanjing for almost a month, and I haven't visited your father. This opportunity is just right. Why don't I pay a visit today!"
　　 Liu Ziyang nodded vigorously, wishing Mo Xiu would go now. Since childhood, his father said he was useless, and this time he brought back a friend like Mo Xiu.
　　 In Liu Ziyang's opinion, his father would definitely praise him.
　　 Mo Xiu followed Liu Ziyang to Liu's house on the sixteenth floor. It was already eight o'clock in the evening. Although it was a bit abrupt, it was not better. They moved nearby.
　　 After entering the door, I realized that Father Liu had a very important business to discuss today, and he was not at home at this time.
　　 But Mother Liu welcomed Mo Xiu warmly, stayed at home for dinner, and asked Liu Ziyang to send Mo Xiu back after dinner.
After Mo Xiu left, Mother Liu said to Liu Ziyang: "Son, you finally made a good friend, and you are no longer a friend. I think this kid is good. You said he is also in the Genting Villa area. On which floor? We need to associate more with him."
　　 Liu Ziyang said excitedly: "Mom, Mo Xiu is on the eighteenth floor, so awesome, he is Don's apprentice!"
　　 Mother Liu was shocked and said, "What? The eighteenth floor? Old Tang's apprentice?"
　　 Turning and entering the house, Liu Ziyang asked, "Mom, what's the matter?"
　　 Liu's mother said angrily: "You dead boy, why didn't you say it earlier, I didn't entertain you well, I will call your dad now!"
　　...
　　Mo Xiu returned to the eighteenth-floor villa. When he first moved, he didn't take a closer look. He just left his things at the door and went to Liu's house.
　　 Counting the basement, the villa has only three floors, but it has a huge living room. When you enter the door, you feel like you are in a square.
　　 There are more than a dozen rooms on the first and second floors. Mo Xiu didn't open one of them, so he randomly found a room on the second floor as his bedroom.
After 　　, I walked around, waiting for Don’s arrival. First I went to the backyard. There was a very large swimming pool in the backyard, surrounded by plants.
　　 Enter the basement, the area of ​​the basement is very large, Mo Xiu once thought it was an underground garage.
　　 went around and found that there was no trace of living in this villa, all the furniture was new, and there were no other items.
　　 It seems that Don’t come to live here after he owns this villa.
　　 The last place where Mo Xiu arrived was the rooftop, which was like a martial arts training ground, with ample space and pleasant scenery.
　　 There is a rocking chair in the corner of the rooftop. Mo Xiu feels very comfortable sitting on it, but he falls asleep before he knows it.
　　...
　　 "Boy! I didn't say to greet me when I came, sleep here!"
　　 
       
 
           


　　 Mo Xiu opened his eyes and saw Old Tang looking straight at him.
　　 "Master, you are here, I accidentally fell asleep."
　　 "Fucky boy, follow me, I have something to explain."
　　 Mo Xiu came to the spirit, this master is finally about to take the responsibility, is it to pass on peerless magic?
　　 After going downstairs, the two of them sat on the sofa, and Mo Xiu looked at Elder Tang expectantly.
　　 Old Tang took out something from his pocket and handed it to Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu took it over and took a look. This is... a kitten?
　　The creature in Mo Xiu's hand is only the size of a palm, and it's furry, with big teary eyes and a beard. Isn't this the cat recorded by the predecessors?
　　Also, this little thing was taken out of the pocket of his clothes by Mr. Tang.
　　 Mo Xiu asked, "Master, what does this mean?"
　　 "Is this little guy cute?"
　　 Mo Xiu looked at the little guy, his sluggish eyes and slow movements were really cute.
　　 Mo Xiu nodded.
　　 Old Tang said with a smile: "Hey, cute is good, and this little guy will be raised by you in the future."
　　 Mo Xiu stretched out his finger and pointed at himself and said, "Me? Raise it?"
　　 "Yes, you come and raise it!"
　　 There is no such thing as a pet anymore, and Mo Xiu thought that Mr. Tang wanted to raise this little guy as a son.
　　 Mo Xiu said bitterly, "But I..."
　　 Elder Don's eyes widened, and Mo Xiu immediately held back his words. This is threatening!
　　 "I will leave it to you!"
　　 Mo Xiu could only admit his fate, and said weakly: "What's its name? Is it a male or female?"
　　 "No name, I picked it up, it's a boy."
　　 "Since you picked it up, you can give him a name!"
　　 Don’t think about it for a while and said: “This little guy was picked up by me and has a great blessing. I hope that he will have a smooth life in his life. How about being called Xiao Fushun?”
　　 Mo Xiu's staring boss, haven't you been in the library for many years? Doesn’t it claim to be able to read every individual? Is it the level of education to read so many books? It's such a name.
　　 Old Tang stared again and said, "What? Are you dissatisfied with the name I gave you?"
　　 Mo Xiu said quickly: "No, I don't mean that at all."
　　 "That's good, there is no dissatisfaction, then it is so decided, it is called Xiaofushun!"
　　 "Master, I still have to participate in the school competition. I may not have time to take care of Xiao Fushun. Do you think..."
　　 Old Don vowed to say: "Hey? Xiao Fushun is very good, don't worry, he stayed in my pocket all the way."
　　 "But..."
　　 hadn't finished speaking, Mo Xiu felt the position where Xiao Fushun was lying on his lap hot.
　　 Mo Xiu lifted it up, and saw a sticky spread on his leg, which was pulled on Mo Xiu's leg.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Mr. Tang, meaning that this is what you said is cute.
　　 Tang Lao smiled heartily: "Hahaha, it may be this way, the journey is a bit far, Xiaofu has diarrhea along the cold."
　　 Mo Xiu put Xiao Fushun on the sofa and wanted to go to the bathroom to take a shower and change his clothes.
　　 "Master, let me take a bath, look at Xiao Fushun!"
　　 Old Don nodded.
　　Mo Xiu walked to the bedroom on the second floor to take out a set of clothes, and then into the bathroom, Xiao Fushun followed all the way.
　　 Xiao Fushun is too small, and it is not easy to walk. The stairs are even more hops.
　　 Mo Xiu turned around and said to Xiao Fushun: "Don't follow me, wait downstairs."
　　 Xiao Fushun raised his head and looked at Mo Xiu's eyes, as if he could understand.
　　 Mo Xiu found it interesting, and said: "Okay, if you understand, go downstairs and wait."
　　 Mo Xiu took two steps and looked back, Xiao Fushun followed.
　　 "Hey, it seems you don't understand."
　　 Mo Xiu ignored Xiao Fushun and went to take a bath first. You can't walk around wearing pants with shit, right?
　　 quickly took a shower and found Xiao Fushun standing by the bathroom door.
　　 was originally lying on the ground lazily, and when Mo Xiu came out, he got up, his head raised high, still looking at Mo Xiu's eyes.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Let's go, come downstairs with me, and see if I can persuade the master to take you away, I will support you, you can..."
　　 Mo Xiu's eyes twitched, and when he went downstairs, he saw that Mr. Tang had already left.
　　 This master is too unreliable.
　　 looked back at Xiao Fushun, who was still following behind him, and held it in his palm.
　　 "Well, now you can't go, let me find you a room."
　　 Xiao Fushun squinted his eyes in Mo Xiu's palm. Mo Xiu thought Xiao Fushun was very comfortable, and stretched out his other hand to touch Xiao Fushun's head.
　　 "Don't say it, it's really good... Xiao Fushun!!! You pulled it again!!!"
　　……
　　 Outside the villa, Don is standing at the door looking inward.
　　 "Mo Xiu ah Mo Xiu, I don't know if you are a blessing or a curse as my apprentice, but since you are capable, you have to bear your due responsibility, I'm sorry."
　　 Old Tang turned and walked away.
　　 "Hey! The seeds have been planted, it depends on when the flowers will bear fruit!"
　　……
　　 In the villa, Mo Xiu washed his hands several times, only to feel that there was no smell. This little Fushun pulled it into his hand again.
　　 At this time, Xiao Fushun was at Mo Xiu's feet, looking at Mo Xiu pitifully and innocently.
　　 Don't stop fighting.
　　 "Don't be cute, pull on me again, I will beat you!"
　　 Xiao Fushun seemed to understand this ruthless remark. He took two steps back and sat on the ground, blinking his eyes and shed tears.
　　 Mo Xiu is one head and two big, this is simply a fairy.
　　 quickly coaxed: "Okay, stop crying, don't beat you, but you have to be good!"
　　 I don't know if it was Mo Xiu's illusion that he actually saw Xiao Fushun nodding slightly.
　　 Mo Xiu is a little funny, such a big gadget, I still know a lot, does Xiao Fushun have a big thumb in his brain?
　　 Mo Xiu touched Xiao Fushun's head and said, "Xiao Fushun, you are so cute. You almost cried just now. You don't look like a boy at all, but like a girl."
　　 Xiao Fushun raised his two front paws~www.mtlnovel.com~ and fell heavily, opening his mouth to reveal his teeth.
　　 Mo Xiu was taken aback for a moment before realizing it. This was showing his majesty.
　　 Moxiu laughed and said, "Hahaha, you are not fierce at all like this."
　　 Mo Xiu gently hit Xiao Fushun on the head with his hand.
　　 Xiao Fushun seemed a little angry, and bit Mo Xiu's finger.
　　 squinted his eyes and closed his nose, as if using the strength of feeding, but Mo Xiu didn't feel any pain at all.
　　 Xiao Fushun tried hard, then pulled it out again, pulling to the ground.
　　 It looks like Xiao Fushun is blinded himself, biting someone can pull out **** by himself.
　　 Mo Xiu helplessly cleaned the ground again.
　　 "Little Fushun, you should be a beast, beasts have talent skills, what are your skills? Isn't it just shit?"
　　 These words seemed to irritate Xiao Fushun, and he threw himself down on Mo Xiu's foot and took a bite.
　　 Mo Xiu pinched Xiao Fushun’s stamina and brought it up and said: "Little things, they have a good character. It's late, and you can go to bed with something to eat!"
　　 Mo Xiu didn't know what Xiao Fushun could eat. He couldn't eat meat when he was so young, so he handed some vegetables from the villa to Xiao Fushun.
　　 Xiao Fushun looked at the green vegetables, then leaned closer and smelled it, and walked away disgustingly.
　　 "Yeah! You are quite a big score, go! Sleep without eating."
　　 Mo Xiu wanted to give Xiao Fushun a separate room, but Xiao Fushun said he would not leave Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu could only take him to his bedroom, Xiao Fushun was very consciously lying on Mo Xiu's stomach, and fell asleep after a while.
　　 Mo Xiu woke up Xiao Fushun and said, "It's okay to sleep here, but if you want to poop, you can pull it anywhere. When you pull it on the bed, I will definitely hit you!"
　　
    
   


　　 In the early morning, a ray of sunshine fell on Mo Xiu's cheek.
　　 I opened my eyes and looked at the scenery outside the window and I didn't want to get up. This place is really comfortable. No matter the temperature, humidity or environment, people can calm down.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't understand, this is the 18th floor of the Genting Villa District, which is the top of the mountain.
　　How can there be such a comfortable climate on the top of the mountain?
　　 glanced at the time, seven o'clock!
　　 It's time to pack up and go out. Today, I will have in-department training.
　　I realized a problem as soon as I sat up, where's Xiao Fushun? Didn’t you sleep on your stomach last night?
　　No on the bed, is it on the ground...
　　 Mo Xiu was stunned when he saw the scene on the ground. The ground was full of Xiao Fushun's feces.
　　 Mo Xiu was about to get angry, remembering what he said last night, Xiao Fushun really didn't pull on the bed, just pulled it all over the floor.
　　 "Hey, you are awesome!"
　　Mo Xiu immediately got up and cleaned up Xiao Fushun's feces. Today's feces are stronger than yesterday, and there is no diarrhea and no smell.
　　 "Little Fushun, how can you pull so much if you haven't eaten? Your talent skills are not really shit, right?"
　　 Xiao Fushun was not angry this time, and he lowered his head a little embarrassingly. Maybe he felt that he was pulling too much.
　　 "It seems to be right!"
　　 Xiao Fushun couldn't bear the humiliation, and barked his fangs to Mo Xiu.
　　 "Save it, take your teeth back!"
　　 Xiao Fushun seemed to understand, retracted his teeth and turned his head to the side, not looking at Mo Xiu.
　　 Mo Xiu still wanted to persuade him to educate, but the doorbell rang.
　　 Shun Xiaofushun in the bedroom before going downstairs.
　　 Xiao Fushun is a beast. If you let other people know that Mo Xiu tamed the beast, that would be a big deal. In the slightest, Xiao Fushun would be killed, and even Mo Xiu would have to be arrested.
　　 This point is no wonder other people. It is true that beasts have caused too much harm to mankind. In addition, the spies lurking among mankind before, privately or publicly, are not allowed to appear in the alliance.
　　 Tang said that he must be a trustworthy person if he wants to live in this villa. That's why.
　　 According to what Mo Xiu now understands, Don's position in the human alliance is not low, which is even more strange.
　　 Elder Tang participated in the war and saw the harm of beasts to humans with his own eyes. Why did he send Xiao Fushun to him now?
　　 Mo Xiu didn't understand and couldn't figure it out.
　　 In his thoughts, Mo Xiu had already reached the door. Opening the door was an unrecognized woman who was about thirty years old and dressed up.
　　 "Hello, are you Mo Xiu, Mr. Mo?"
　　 "I am, what can I do?"
　　 The woman bowed and said, "I'm sorry to disturb you. I am the housekeeper on the 18th floor of Genting Villa. My name is Fang Yun. Can I interrupt you for a few minutes. May I ask something?"
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at the time, but it was still too late.
　　 "Just ask."
　　 "How many people do you live with?"
　　 "I'm alone at the moment, and I'm not sure if I will live in other people in the future."
　　 Fang Yun quickly recorded on the phone, and then said: "Okay, do you have any requirements for the villa staff?"
　　 "Employee? What employee?"
　　 "Sorry, I am abrupt, Genting Villa will help the head of the household recruit staff, such as nanny, chef, and cleaning staff."
　　 Mo Xiu nodded and said, "Oh, my villa does not need employees."
　　 "Don't you need cooks and cleaners?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded again considering that Xiao Fushun had nothing to lose.
　　 "Well, Mr. Mo, do we need hourly service? That is to send someone to clean the villa or prepare meals at the time specified by the head of the household."
　　 Mo Xiu thought for a moment, this is feasible.
　　 "Are the people you hired safe? You can't steal things, right?"
"Don't worry, Mr. Mo, the staff are absolutely safe, and they have cleaning skills, and are very efficient. Your house can be cleaned in less than half an hour. During this period, there will be a person in charge above the supervisor level. Please be assured of your safety. Nothing will be spread out in your place, including the removal of the dead body."
　　 Mo Xiu nodded and said, "Okay, I only need the cleaning service. The time is set at 7:20 every morning, which is five minutes later, starting from today."
　　 "Okay! Let's arrange it!"
　　 "There is one condition that must be remembered!"
 "You say!"
　　 "The fifth room on the second floor is my bedroom. I don't like people approaching my room, so they can't enter my bedroom."
　　Fang Yun nodded his head and said: "No problem, we will remember all customer requirements!"
　　 Next, Fang Yun asked some more questions, and Mo Xiu sighed, is this the life of the rich? Everything is customized.
　　 Mo Xiu interrupted Fang Yun immediately when the cleaning time was about to come.
　　 "Okay, I don't need the rest of the service, I need a cleaning service."
　　Mo Xiu actually doesn't even want to be clean, but how can he clean up such a big villa?
　　 sent Fang Yun away, Mo Xiu trot all the way back to the room.
　　 As soon as he entered the house, Xiao Fushun said "Meow!"
　　 "It seems that you are really a cat. The book says that only cats can meow."
　　 Xiao Fushun gritted his teeth in anger, and Mo Xiu stretched out his finger and immediately became well-behaved and sensible.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "As soon as someone enters the villa and hears movement, you can't make any noise. They will leave soon, you know?"
　　 Xiao Fushun moved his ears, listening to the movement outside the door.
　　 Perhaps seeing Mo Xiu's serious expression, Xiao Fushun nodded cutely.
　　 "Haha, well, I will test you in a while."
　　 The cleaning staff arrived soon, and Xiao Fushun did not make any noise as agreed.
　　 At this time, Liu Ziyang called Mo Xiu.
　　 "Boss~www.mtlnovel.com~ What are you doing? Come down, let's go to school together, I have to participate in the department selection today."
　　 "Oh, I'm supervising the cleaning staff to clean the villa. Wait five minutes for me, then I will go down."
　　 "I'm going, boss, you are too free, right? You supervise this?"
　　 "Okay, I will go down here!"
　　 Mo Xiu hung up the phone, took some more vegetables from the refrigerator, and a large pot.
　　 went back to the room and said to Xiao Fushun, "Xiao Fushun, I know you don’t like to eat vegetables, now there is nothing else, you can deal with it first, and I’ll come back to bring you meat to eat at night!"
　　 When Xiao Fushun heard the flesh's eyes shine, Mo Xiu was a little surprised, can such a big bite the flesh?
　　 Mo Xiu hurriedly changed his clothes and got ready to go out. Before leaving, he said: "If you want to poop, you can pull it into the basin, and you will eat meat!"
　　 After going out, Mo Xiu found Liu Ziyang. It is not early now. If it hadn't been for a strong son to send it, he might be late.
　　 Qiangzi's driving skills are still so amazing, he came to Yenching University in less than ten minutes.
　　 Mo Xiu hurriedly came to the martial arts venue No. 3, when the others were already there.
　　 Mumu saw Mo Xiu entering the door, and said to everyone: "Okay, everyone is here, starting the actual combat training in the morning. Today is one-on-one training. The list of matches is Mo Xiu..."
　　 Mo Xiu had already arrived in the team at this time, Dong Fang smiled and said in a low voice: "Mo Xiu, you are really awesome. You were almost late as soon as you moved out. Are you immersed in the gentle country?"
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at him and said, "I think you haven't been beaten enough!"
　　 was so scared that Dong Fang shut up immediately, this Mo Xiu, dare to do it or not.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo heard the words of the two and looked at Mo Xiu with a small mouth. Since noon yesterday, he has never seen Mo Xiu again.
　　

 
       
 
           


After 　　 Mumu is assigned to the match list, a group of matches will start.
　　 Mo Xiu is facing a member of Xiao Lan team, whose skill is to strengthen instant attack power.
　　 Without much effort, Mo Xiu defeated him, even without using skills, he defeated him with the flexibility of his moves.
　　The most tiring thing in the morning of the game was not the ten promoted members of the match, but the mumu who watched the match.
　　 In every battle, Mu Mu will take a lot of notes seriously.
　　 The morning game is over, and the afternoon is the special training that Mu Mu said.
　　 Mo Xiu originally thought that special training was the basic training of physical training and speed strength.
　　 But I didn't expect Mu Mu to customize a set of training methods for everyone based on the battle situation in the past two days.
　　 When Mumu spoke out the training plan, everyone was shocked.
"Dong Fang focuses on training explosive power and speed, He Lingyue improves physical fitness and moves flexibility, Yang Qingzhuo needs to improve attack explosiveness, Hu Xianming mainly improves physical fitness and overall awareness, the goal is to take care of all teammates, Xiao Lan conducts will training,... , Mo Xiu is the last, you... just practice."
　　 Originally, Mu Mu wanted to increase Mo Xiu's physical fitness, because Mo Xiu was the strongest point, and it was likely that he would fight to the end and fight for a long time.
　　 Mumu not only pointed out the parts that everyone needs to strengthen, but also designed a set of unique training methods for everyone according to the situation.
　　 For example, Hu Xianming, she had only released the Holy Light on herself in the heads-up match before, and her observation of the situation was not very strong.
　　The training plan that Mumu designed for Hu Xianming was to give her a few goals. At first, Mumu would call out loudly for her to impose holy light on which goal, and then slowly let her judge which goal needs holy light.
　　 Mumu's training method, which accurately finds out each person's weakness and strengthens it, is very targeted, and everyone improves very quickly.
　　 If the respect for Mu Mu before was to give face, then everyone now truly feels that Mu Mu is very powerful and recognizes her status as an instructor.
　　 During an afternoon of high-intensity training, Cao Fenglin unexpectedly came to visit the class, and brought some food and drinks to replenish energy.
　　 However, the purpose of Cao Fenglin's squad was not pure. After he arrived, he ignored the training and directly took Mumu to the side to chat.
　　 Mumu wanted to see everyone's training, but was stopped by Cao Fenglin.
　　The name says: The method is handed over to them, as a teacher, you have to give them space.
　　 Cao Fenglin and Mu Mu walked very close. Even now, even blind Dong Fang can see that the relationship between the two is unusual.
　　 Cao Fenglin looked decadent before. Although the various competition methods designed are very good, he is always lazy.
　　The shaggy beard made Mo Xiu once thought he was in his thirties or forty years old.
　　 But now that the image is sorted out, he is clearly an aspiring young man of twenty-seven and eighty-eight.
　　 Mo Xiu couldn't help sighing that Cao Fenglin could teach at Yenching University at an age like that, and he also brought the department. It seems that the school also liked him very much. He was definitely a man of the world.
　　 Cao Fenglin didn't stay long before he was driven away by Mu Mu.
　　 In one afternoon, the ten advanced players were very fulfilling, including Mo Xiu.
　　 Mumu still customized a training plan for Mo Xiu. The strongest point is not only not to relax, but also to be the strictest.
　　 This set of training methods is very simple. It is a training method used by universities to improve the basics, but the intensity is ten times.
　　 Even Mo Xiu was sweating profusely under such training intensity.
　　 Several people took a shower in the bathroom inside the venue after the training.
　　 Mo Xiu's mind was on Xiao Fushun and the royal family, so he was a little distracted and slowed down in the shower.
After 　　 came out, he found that Yang Qingzhuo, He Lingyue, Dong Fang and Mu Mu were waiting for him.
　　 Mo Xiu said, "I'm sorry, I've been waiting for a long time, why didn't you leave first?"
　　 Mo Xiu didn't mean to drive people away. He just felt that if he moved out now, these people could go back to the dormitory first.
　　 Mumu said heartily: "It's time for the four of us in Class 6 to get together and have a meal together?"
　　 looked at Yang Qingzhuo and smiled secretly: "Plus...plus your little stalker!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo bared his teeth and leaned against Mo Xiu with a smile.
　　 Not only does he look lifeless, he is also very proud.
　　 Several people are very familiar, and they are relatively casual to have a meal and get together. They went straight to the cafeteria for a meal.
　　 Everyone thought Mo Xiu moved only because Mo Xiu had a meal.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't care too much. He felt that life is very good now, full of goals, and there are many friends, which is completely different from the retreat in high school.
　　 During the meal, a few people chatted. Everyone wanted to ask Mu Mu and Cao Fenglin what was going on, but they didn't feel very good.
　　 Finally, He Lingyue, who had the best relationship with Mu Mu, couldn't help it anymore.
　　 "Mumu, you and Teacher Cao..."
　　 Mumu heard this topic immediately, and there was a blush on his face, no need to answer, everyone already knew the answer.
　　 Looking at everyone's ‘understand’ eyes, Mu Mu opened and closed his mouth, and opened his mouth again without speaking.
　　 Mu Mu, who has always been straightforward and capable, hesitated so much.
　　 finally sighed and said, "Hey! Tell you, I actually have a relationship with Cao Fenglin...a boyfriend and girlfriend."
　　 Dong Fang slapped the table and stood up. Just about to shout loudly, he suddenly remembered the last time and sat down and asked in a low voice.
　　 "Mumu, teacher-student love! It's exciting!"
　　 Mu Mu's eyes were sweating, if Dong Fang shouted out just now, tomorrow, ‘Mu Mu, excitement! I’m afraid the pictures of ’will spread throughout the school.
　　 Mo Xiu punched Dong Fang in the head and said, "This is a university, it's normal. If you have the ability to marry a beautiful university teacher and go back, no one will care about you."
Dong Fang was originally upset when he was beaten, but when Mo Xiu heard what Mo Xiu said, he immediately jumped up to Mu Mu. I always regarded you as my sister. Teacher Cao Fenglin is my brother-in-law. Brother-in-law helps me see if there is a suitable female teacher..."
　　 Mu Mu smiled awkwardly, and Mo Xiu hit Dong Fang's head with another punch.
　　 Dong Fang looked at it with a puzzled face. I asked for the idea you gave, and you beat me!
　　 He Lingyue leaned closer to Mumu and asked, "Mumu, tell me, how did Teacher Cao chase you?"
　　 As soon as I asked these words, Mu Mi's face turned red, and he almost buried his head under the table, saying in an incomprehensible voice: "I am chasing him!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo, who hadn't spoken all the time, came in spirit now, his eyes widened.
　　 "Instructor Mu Mu, how did you chase it? Can't you..."
　　 while talking, the corner of his eyes turned towards Mo Xiu.
　　 Everyone knew what Yang Qingzhuo meant.
　　 Mu Mu just like this, talking rawly about her experience of chasing a man after a woman.
"Cao Fenglin is very casual and lazy on the surface, but in fact it is really gentle. In fact, I lied to you about one thing. I have been in contact with him after the class competition. My skills are very special and my actual combat ability is not strong. So I approached Cao Fenglin and wanted to ask how to improve his grades."
　　 Mo Xiu smiled and interjected: "You belong to a small stove!"
　　 Mumu knew that Mo Xiu was joking, and while responding with a smile, he also opened up completely, not as restrained as before.
　　 "Every time I look for him, he is very gentle and attentive to answer the doubts in my heart. His laziness has lost hope, but he retains the warmth of the past."
　　 "I'm very curious, how can such a man become what he is now, after inquiring about him, I found...I like him!"

　　 Just when Mo Xiu and the others were holding their breath and wanting to hear about Cao Fenglin's time, Mu Mu paused for a moment, showing embarrassment.
　　 Mo Xiu keenly caught this point and asked: "What's the matter? Don't talk about it if it's inconvenient."
　　 Mu shook his head and said, "Actually, there is nothing. As long as you want to inquire about these things, it's easy to know. It's not a secret. Many people know this."
　　 "It's like this. Cao Fenglin had a girlfriend before. The two of them were the golden boys and girls of Yenching University. After graduation, they stayed at school to become teachers. At that time, Cao Fenglin was sunny, capable, and positive."
"Everything must start from six years ago. The good time between the two of them did not last long. One night six years ago, Cao Fenglin could not find his girlfriend, and only found out behind the school building the next morning. The corpse."
　　 Mo Xiu narrowed his eyes, killing teachers in the Yanjing University? This incident did not cause a sensation, but only spread on a small scale.
　　 It seems that it was because of this incident that Cao Fenglin was decadent until now.
　　 "Cao Fenglin's girlfriend at the time was a teacher of the assault department. She had no actual combat ability, but she was assassinated. There was a wound on the center of his eyebrows that ran through the entire head, and there were no wounds in the rest, or even signs of battle.
　　 Mo Xiu originally narrowed his eyes, the boss suddenly opened, this is... a hot weapon!
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "Then Teacher Cao didn't investigate at that time?"
Mu Mu nodded and said: "I have investigated. I asked Cao Fenglin. Both he and I were unwilling to mention the matter. I only learned in a few words that he investigated for three years, day and night, but in the end it was still give up."
　　 Mo Xiu is sure, Cao Fenglin must have found something during the investigation, otherwise, why would he give up easily? It seems that if you have time, you must talk to Cao Fenglin. The task of thermal weapons has finally made some progress.
　　 He Lingyue clutched her chin and said, "You like him because of this, right?"
　　 Mumu nodded earnestly and said, "Yes, I just felt distressed at first, but later found that it was a liking."
　　 Mu Mu no longer blushed, straightened up, jokingly said: "I launched a fierce attack on him, but he was always indifferent."
　　 Mo Xiu interrupted and said, "Until that day you were eliminated in the department trial."
　　 Mumu pointed at Mo Xiu and said, "Yes, I was very sad that day, so hard work still did not change the result, he came to comfort me, let go of his laziness, and showed warmth."
　　 He Lingyue patted Mumu and said, "Oh, it's numb, but I really congratulate you, Teacher Cao is very good."
　　 Mu nodded and said, "Yeah, I think too."
　　 But Yang Qingzhuo, who has always been in a high mood, is somewhat depressed.
　　 "Sister Mu Mu, you said so much, but you didn't say how to chase it?"
　　 "Hahaha..."
　　 Everyone laughed...
　　 After dinner, Mo Xiu walked to the school gate alone, Qiangzi had been waiting here long ago.
　　 opened the car door, before Mo Xiu waited, a black figure swished into the car.
　　 Mo Xiu doesn't need to look at it, it must be Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 "You get out of the car, I want to go home!"
　　 "I will go home too!"
　　 "Where is your home? Let Qiangzi send you back!"
　　 "Where is your home, where is my home!"
　　 "Stop making trouble, go back to the dormitory, see you tomorrow!"
　　 "I already contacted the school yesterday. I quit the dormitory and can't go back to the dormitory. I put all my luggage in the trunk."
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at Qiangzi. The luggage must have been put in advance, which means that Yang Qingzhuo had contacted Qiangzi in advance.
　　 Hadron turned the endoscope to one side so that Mo Xiu could not see him, and then leaned on the steering wheel and pretended to sleep.
　　 Mo Xiu said to Yang Qingzhuo: "Can I trust you?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo pursed his mouth and said: "Of course it can! If you don't even believe me, who can you believe?"
 "Can I trust you?"
　　 "I said, yes! I can! You have to believe me!"
 "Can I trust you?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo didn't answer easily this time. Looking at Mo Xiu's serious and serious expression, he could guess that Mo Xiu had a secret.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo clenched his fists tightly, what about the shameless secret? Even if you are a beast, I will follow you.
After 　　, he nodded and said: "Yes!"
　　 There was only one word last time, but it made Mo Xiu most at ease. Although Yang Qingzhuo was a little weird, but not stupid, Mo Xiu was willing to believe her.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't speak any more, went straight into the car and closed the door.
　　 shouted: "Qiangzi, don't pretend to be asleep, let's go!"
　　 Qiangzi sat up awkwardly, stepped on the gas pedal, and the car... galloped away.
　　 Passing through a fresh food supermarket, Mo Xiu asked Qiangzi to stop and promised Xiao Fushun to buy meat and go back.
　　 Mo Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo walked into the supermarket. Yang Qingzhuo got excited and said, "Mo Xiu, can I take it whatever I want?"
　　 Mo Xiu was shocked all over, how could he forgot about this eating god? I just ate so little in the cafeteria, and I will definitely eat something special when I go home.
　　 Mo Xiu nodded and said, "Of course, you can just check out!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo's face immediately changed, turning into a bitter melon face, and said aggrieved: "I'm going home with you, you won't give me food!"
　　Mo Xiu look around, there are still a lot of people here. Once Yang Qingzhuo gets into trouble here, he will have to make headlines tomorrow.
　　 In order to avoid trouble, Mo Xiu can only compromise.
　　 "Well, take whatever you want, don't be too casual, I'm not very rich!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo smiled cutely, and went shopping.
　　 Half an hour later, Mo Xiu regretted taking Yang Qingzhuo with him. He bought too much meat. Once the bill was settled, it was fifteen thousand!
　　 Mo Xiu never thought about buying food for fifteen thousand.
　　 Looking at Yang Qingzhuo with a look of excitement, Mo Xiu expressed helplessness.
　　 Qiangzi drove very fast and returned to the Genting Villa area within a few minutes.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo got a little dazed after getting out of the car, looked at Mo Xiu blankly and said, "Mo Xiu, do you live here?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded and said, "Yes, I live here."
　　 "You all live here, UU reading www.uukanshu.com still doesn't let me eat meat."
　　 Mo Xiu thought that Yang Qingzhuo was serious once, but he didn't expect to be here waiting for you.
　　 "I won't let it, didn't you buy it?"
　　 As soon as he mentioned this, Yang Qingzhuo looked at the two big bags of meat he was carrying, and smiled.
　　 Mo Xiu took Yang Qingzhuo up the elevator to the eighteenth floor, walked to the front of the villa, and stopped.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo asked in confusion: "Why don't you leave?"
　　 After speaking, he looked down at the meat, which meant to hurry in and eat the meat!
　　 Mo Xiu said seriously: "What does your family do?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo tilted his head and expressed doubts.
　　 "I need to know you, otherwise it is impossible to trust you completely!"
　　 Mo Xiu thought about it, but still felt that he should be more cautious.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo replied very seriously: "Are we exchanging handles?"
　　 Mo Xiu was amused and said, "Who taught you this?"
　　 "My father!"
　　 "Who is your father?"
　　 "My father is the general staff of the Yanjing Division of the Alliance Army!"
　　 Mo Xiu was surprised, this is a big shot.
　　 "Did your father not let you keep a secret?"
　　 "We are exchanging handles!"
　　 "Interesting, I will take you in, but no matter what you see, even if you decide not to interact with me in the future, don't tell me? I believe in your character."
　　 Yang Qingzhuo said: "Even if you are a beast, I will not stop being with you."
　　 Mo Xiu laughed and led Yang Qingzhuo into the villa and into his room.
　　 When he opened the door and saw the leisurely little Fushun, Yang Qingzhuo widened his eyes and looked at Mo Xiu incredulously.
　　 "Are you really a beast? Is this your kid?"

　　 "Are you really a beast? Is this your kid?"
　　 Mo Xiu said, "I am not a beast, and Xiao Fushun is not my child."
　　 Yang Qingzhuo took a closer look at Xiao Fushun and said, "Who is this little guy?"
　　 "I adopted this!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo looked at Xiao Fushun seriously again, then looked at Mo Xiu seriously and said, "Oh, I see, what's its name?"
　　 "Little Fushun!"
　　 "Hahaha, it's called Xiaofushun?"
　　 Maybe because of Yang Qingzhuo's ridicule, Xiao Fushun looked upset at this time.
　　 Xiao Fushun moved his nose, suddenly became excited, and rushed to Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 turned out to be staring at the meat in Yang Qingzhuo's hand!
　　 Xiao Fushun bit the plastic bag and refused to let go, Mo Xiu hugged it in his arms.
　　 "Small things, you can't eat them raw now, eat them later when they are cooked!"
　　 Xiao Fushun’s little head reads big doubts, why can’t I eat raw?
　　 Mo Xiu took the meat from Yang Qingzhuo and prepared to go downstairs to cook it.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo immediately picked up Xiao Fushun and said, "Little thing, you are pretty cute!"
　　 Xiao Fushun was not so good to talk, looked at Yang Qingzhuo disgustedly, and after struggling to no avail, turned his head aside and ignored Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 Mo Xiu saw that Yang Qingzhuo had adapted so quickly, he felt relieved and went downstairs with two big bags of meat.
　　 After putting the meat in the kitchen, Mo Xiu became embarrassed. He didn't know how to make it.
　　 looked upstairs, Yang Qingzhuo couldn't even count on it. After thinking about it, he could only make the simplest one, hot pot?
　　 The next step is to cut the meat. Mo Xiu has only eaten a hot pot, and the meat I saw last time was slice by slice.
　　 Mo Xiu has never cut meat, and is not very good at using a kitchen knife, so he just took out the Hei Lin and cut it.
　　 Black Lin cuts iron like mud, not to mention the meat. The cut is light and easy, and the meat is thin and even.
After 　　 prepare pots and utensils, the whole process takes less than half an hour.
　　 "Yang Qingzhuo! Xiao Fushun! Go downstairs to eat meat!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo heard that there was meat to eat, and immediately rushed down holding Xiao Fushun.
　　 Mo Xiu said, "I won't do anything else, just eat hot pot!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo said nonchalantly: "It's okay, as long as there is meat, I won't pick it."
　　 Xiao Fushun in his arms looked at Yang Qingzhuo, and nodded in agreement.
　　 Mo Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo sat down, Xiao Fushun followed the two of them in a manner, and sat down beside the plate on the table.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo has begun to use his talents again. Like last time, he cooked the meat and divided the meat in one go!
　　 Half of the meat was killed in this meal, which was a few thousand dollars. Mo Xiu didn't eat less even though he was distressed.
　　Yang Qingzhuo performed normally, showing his true spirit of eating, Xiao Fushun also had a good taste, and Mo Xiu picked some tender meat for him.
　　 It may be that he has never eaten cooked meat before, and Xiao Fushun gets more excited as he eats.
　　 The next few days passed very peacefully, Xiao Fushun also slowly accepted Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 Mo Xiu went to the martial arts field during the day, and Mu Mu trained everyone, and he also had a lot of experience.
　　 I have to say that Cao Fenglin said that Mu Mu has a talent for coaching, not for picking up girls.
　　 Mumu has dug in-depth with everyone these days, and the training plan has become more complete and scientific.
　　 gives people the feeling that they have completely forgotten that Mu Mu and everyone are students in the same class, as if they were teachers in the first place.
　　 July 28th, there are still two days before the game.
　　 Cao Fenglin's substitute selection is also over, and six substitutes are brought to the stadium of Mo Xiu and others.
　　 Mumu and Cao Fenglin put everyone aside, and they understood and discussed in the corner, feeling quite agitated.
After 　　, I don’t know who won. Mu Mu walked to the center of the stadium and said, "I have discussed with Teacher Cao and decided to regroup!"
　　 Mo Xiu frowned, looked at the people around him, and didn't want to regroup. These teammates were all selected by themselves, and there was a certain tacit understanding in these days of training.
Cao Fenglin seemed to see Mo Xiu's reluctance, and immediately said: "Don't worry, this regrouping is a good thing. In the past, the strength of the two teams in our auxiliary department was very equal. This is to show more of each person's skills and characteristics, and to improve the performance The odds of being selected into the school team."
"But this is not the case with other departments. The other four departments have a chance to compete for the championship, so they will be divided into one and two teams. The eight people in the first team are the strongest eight people. The purpose is to get the ranking. The second team is obviously much weaker. The purpose is to experience."
　　 "Speaking of which, you should understand, right?"
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Do you want us to regroup and form a team that can compete for ranking?"
Cao Fenglin nodded and said: "Yes, the support systems were the weakest in the past. As for the reason...you all understand, but this time it's different. We have Mo Xiu, Xiao Lan, and a host of excellent support systems. I think we are still somewhat competitive."
　　 Yang Qingzhuo was a little unhappy, for fear that Cao Fenglin would separate himself from Mo Xiu.
　　 "Teacher Cao, how did the team divide?"
　　 Cao Fenglin pointed to Mu Mu and said, "Mu Mu knows you better than I do, and she decides who she chooses."
　　 No matter how great Mumu is, she is only a student after all, and she seems a little hesitant. The relationship between everyone is very good, and she does not want to offend anyone.
After 　　 took two deep breaths, Mu Mu's eyes became firm, and his personal emotions should not affect the overall situation. As an excellent coach, this is a step that must be taken.
　　 "The starting candidates for the first team are: Mo Xiu, Xiao Lan, Hu Xianming, Yang Qingzhuo, He Lingyue..."
　　 Mu Mu said the group in one breath, Mo Xiu's team hardly changed, Xiao Lan entered the first team and Dong Fang became a substitute.
　　 It can be seen that Mumu has considered a lot. In terms of personnel strength and tacit understanding, Xiao Lan is a strong attack point, which can be plug and play, has a very strong defense force, and can also replace Dong Fang's meat shield positioning.
　　 In this way, both Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan can become the core, and the tactics become diversified.
　　 After Mumu finished speaking, Cao Fenglin added: "The first and second teams have been divided~www.mtlnovel.com~ Do you have any comments? If not, let's just decide."
　　 The members of the original Xiaolan team were a bit reluctant, but looking at the current team members, they were helpless. They were indeed stronger than themselves.
　　 Cao Fenglin continued: "Okay! I don't have any opinion to decide like this. If you continue to train, I won't bother!"
　　 After talking, Cao Fenglin left directly, and the scene was handed over to Mu Mu.
Mu Mu clapped his hands and said: "Okay, everyone is cheering up, and the game is about to go in two days. Next, there will be team battles. One team will play against the second team. The restriction is that the first team can't use skills. ."
　　……
　　 At night, Mo Xiu returned to the villa, always feeling that the whole villa was not suitable for him and Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 But after much deliberation, there are almost no people who can be completely trusted. At this time, you can't let others see Xiao Fushun at will.
　　 Finally, Mo Xiu thought of someone, someone who can be completely trusted...Zheng Yi!
　　 Mo Xiu patted the table and said: "Yeah, why forgot him!"
　　 After making a call, he was ready to go out.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo and Xiao Fushun both looked at Mo Xiu blankly.
　　 "Mo Xiu, where are you going?"
　　 "Pick someone up!"
　　Mo Xiu found Qiangzi directly after he went out, and went to pick up Zheng Yi with Qiangzi.
　　 After arriving at Qingyun University, Mo Xiu felt something was wrong. Why are there so few people on campus?
　　 Because he had called before, Zheng Yi had already waited with his luggage.
　　 Mo Xiu asked after getting in the car: "Zheng Yi, why are there so few people in your school?"
　　 "Oh, our school died last night. A girl had her temple penetrated!"
　　 Mo Xiu narrowed his eyes, telling Qiangzi not to leave.
　　 "Shoot?"
　　

    
   


　　 "Shot? What do you mean? Mo Xiu, you mean that girl was killed by a hot weapon?"
　　 Mo Xiu said with a serious expression: "I think it's possible. Is there a photo to see?"
　　 Zheng Yi took out his mobile phone and searched for it.
　　 "Last night I clearly remembered someone posted it. Now it is gone. Someone will save it. I will help you ask, I heard this morning that the message was blocked. Is this the reason the photo was deleted?"
　　 Mo Xiu said: "If it is a thermal weapon, the school is likely to block the news to avoid panic."
　　 Zheng Yi handed the phone to Mo Xiu and said: "I found it, look at the photo!"
　　 Mo Xiu could tell at a glance that the blood hole on that head was definitely caused by a pistol.
　　 "It should have been shot, this is in trouble!"
　　 Mo Xiu has been waiting for the follow-up development of the heat weapon incident, but he did not expect it to be so serious, killing students directly on the campus.
　　 "Really shot? Fuck, so scary? That thing is so powerful?"
　　 Mo Xiu said, "I once got a pistol and did an experiment. Let me tell you that, without precautions, I might be killed in one shot."
　　 Zheng Yi was so scared that he sat back and said: "I'm going, so powerful? I want to stay to protect my goddess."
　　 Mo Xiu also grabbed Zheng Yi and said, "To be specific about this, where was the girl's body found?"
　　 "In the corner behind the school building, it's basically a blind spot. If it weren't for a couple dating there, it might not be possible to find the body."
　　 Behind the teaching building? Cao Fenglin's girlfriend was also found behind the school building. Could it be any connection?
　　 Mo Xiu asked subconsciously: "What's the name of this girl? Do you have a boyfriend?"
　　 Zheng Yi thought for a while and said, "It's called Zhang Nana, and I have a boyfriend called Yang Qingfeng. What do you ask of this? Is this related to shooting? Is it love killing?"
　　 "Is this couple famous in school?"
　　 Zheng Yi said carelessly: "It's very famous, just like me, it's the existence at the top of the pyramid."
　　 Mo Xiu opened the door and got out of the car. He turned around and said to Zheng Yi: "Go, let's go to Yang Qingfeng, I have something to know."
　　 turned his head and said to Qiangzi: "Jiangzi, wait for us first."
　　 Qiangzi nodded, Zheng Yi said: "You play with me, I just got in the car."
　　 Mo Xiu ignored Zheng Yi and walked directly into the school. Zheng Yi hurriedly followed.
　　 "Mo Xiu, why are you so concerned about this matter?"
　　 "I am investigating this matter, and I feel that it is not easy."
　　 Zhang Nana, who was killed, had a boyfriend, and both of them were also prominent figures in the school. The body was found behind the school building. This is exactly the same as what Cao Fenglin experienced.
　　 Following Zheng Yi, Mo Xiu quickly found this man named Yang Qingfeng.
　　 Yang Qingfeng is very strong and can be regarded as a man in the school.
　　 Seeing the two find them, they are full of unwillingness to cooperate.
　　 Mo Xiu stretched out his hand and said, "Hello, my name is Mo Xiu, and I want to ask some questions."
　　Yang Qingfeng said impatiently: "It's really troublesome, you guys say, I have something else."
　　 Mo Xiu was taken aback, Yang Qingfeng's girlfriend died, but there was no sadness at all, not even unhappy at all.
　　 "I want to ask about your girlfriend Zhang Nana."
　　 "It's really annoying, you can't ask anything else? I don't know how she died. I couldn't contact her that night. Is there anything else? I left without me."
　　 Yang Qingfeng pushed Zheng Yi away and walked forward. Zheng Yi grabbed Yang Qingfeng and said, "Boy, your girlfriend is dead, are you so arrogant?"
　　 Mo Xiu said, "Hey, Zheng Yi, we are not here to cause trouble. May I ask one last question?"
　　 Yang Qingfeng shook off Zheng Yi and said, "Hurry up and ask, I'm very annoying."
　　 "Are you going to investigate this matter?"
　　 Yang Qingfeng smiled and said, "Why is this problem again? I don't have time to investigate, it's too late for me to hide."
　　 After speaking, he turned around and left, without giving Mo Xiu a chance to ask further questions.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Is he usually like this?"
　　 Zheng Yi was a little unhappy being provoked.
　　 "I don't know the specifics. I didn't have any contact before, just pretending to be a ruthless person, why didn't he die?"
　　 Mo Xiu always thinks something is wrong, why does Yang Qingfeng have such an attitude? Is there a discord between lovers?
　　 "Let’s go first and take you to my new home."
　　 "Mo Xiu, you are so awesome, how long have you been here in Yanjing? I can buy a house now, let's go! Go and see!"
　　 Mo Xiu decided not to stun him here, and planned to talk to Cao Fenglin tomorrow.
　　 I wanted to wait for the school qualifiers to end and find a suitable time to ask again, but it seems that I can’t wait any longer.
　　 Mo Xiu and a few people returned to the Genting Villa, Zheng Yi stood at the door for a long time without stepping in.
　　 "Fuck!!!"
　　 A few minutes later, Zheng Yi sprayed a big **** on Mo Xiu's face.
　　 Mo Xiu said, "What are you doing? Go in!"
　　 At this time, Zheng Yi smiled, took out his cell phone and did the same thing as Liu Ziyang, taking pictures frantically.
　　 "How are you Liu Ziyang with a virtue? What kind of pictures are you taking?"
　　 "I am not the same as Fatty Liu. He is to show off. I am chasing the goddess. With these photos, the goddess knows that I live here. He will definitely add points."
　　Zheng Yi and Liu Ziyang may be more familiar than Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang, and it's nothing to call Fatty Liu.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at his unpromising appearance, turned around to enter the door, and was about to close it.
　　 "I will shut you out if you don't come in!"
　　 "Hey! Don't don't don't, this is here!"
　　 Zheng Yi said and took a few photos, and squeezed in the door at the last moment when Mo Xiu closed the door.
As soon as the two entered the door, Yang Qingzhuo ran downstairs holding Xiao Fushun and saw Zheng Yi hiding Xiao Fushun in his arms~www.mtlnovel.com~ Zheng Yi was shocked when he saw this scene. Come.
　　 "Mo Xiu, you...you...you...what did you give birth to?"
　　 "His name is Xiao Fushun, he should be a little beast!"
　　 "Fuck, I said Mo Xiu, you've been so fierce since you were young, so you are a beast!"
　　 "I am not a beast, Xiao Fushun is a beast!"
　　 Zheng Yi looked at Yang Qingzhuo suspiciously and said, "Then you are also a beast?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo shook his head vigorously.
　　 Zheng Yi scratched his head and said: "You are not a beast, and you are not a beast, so how can you two give birth to a beast?"
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Who told you that Xiao Fushun was born to the two of us? Don't talk nonsense, Yang Qingzhuo and I are nothing!"
　　 Zheng Yi said with a look of contempt: "Guys, you two live together now, there is nothing else? What kind of noble in my place, don't worry! I won't talk to Mu Qingyi."
　　 immediately covered his mouth after speaking, as if saying something that shouldn't be said.
　　 Mo Xiu glared at him, and Yang Qingzhuo asked, "Mo Xiu, who is Mu Qingyi?"
　　 Mo Xiu then explained to Zheng Yi the origin of Xiao Fushun, the two people didn't say anything about their feelings, and Zheng Yi didn't say much.
　　 explained to Yang Qingzhuo who Mu Qingyi was, but Yang Qingzhuo still refused to give up.
　　……
　　 At noon the next day, Mo Xiu directly found Cao Fenglin's office, and Mumu was also there when he came in.
　　 Mo Xiu said to Mu Mu, "Mu Mu, I have something I want to talk to Teacher Cao."
　　 Mumu nodded wittily and walked out.
　　 Cao Fenglin leaned on the chair and said, "What's the matter?"
　　Mo Xiu directly put the pistol that he brought back from Fanjie on the table with a "clang".
　　 
       
 
           


　　 Cao Fenglin looked at the pistol and said, "How did you get this gun?"
　　 Mo Xiu said: "I bought this gun on the black market. I am investigating the thermal weapon. I hope the teacher can help me."
　　 Mo Xiu took out the Shadow Medal to show his identity, so that Cao Fenglin would not think he was a criminal.
　　 Cao Fenglin regained his lazy appearance and said, "How can I help you?"
　　 "You have been investigating thermal weapons for five years, and you must have found something. I thought the situation would not develop too fast, but I didn't expect something to happen so soon."
　　 "Are you talking about Qingyun University?"
　　 "Yes! Do you know?"
　　 "That was indeed a shooting case, but nothing can be found."
　　 Mo Xiu frowned and said, "Teacher Cao, I have no intention of offending, but don't you think this case is very similar to what you experienced at the beginning?"
　　 Cao Fenglin sneered: "Hehe, where does it look like?"
　　 "The time, place, modus operandi, and selection of victims are all consistent."
　　 "Even if it's abnormal, would you do a similar case again after six years?"
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head and said, "I don't understand what you mean."
　　 "If you don't understand, don't investigate it anymore. This matter is thankless. It's better to focus on improving yourself. You have a bright future. Don't waste time like me."
　　 Mo Xiu stood up and said, "Teacher, I can take care of myself, but what about my relatives and friends? I don't want anyone I know to die in a hot weapon attack."
　　 Cao Fenglin waved his hand for Mo Xiu to sit down.
　　 "Sit down first, don't get excited. I have paid attention to this incident and investigated it, including all the information of Zhang Nana and Yang Qingfeng. This incident has no reference value. The investigation will continue to break the clues."
　　 It turned out that Cao Fenglin had investigated before Mo Xiu, no wonder Yang Qingfeng meant what he said at the time. Someone had asked the same question before.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Cao Fenglin unwillingly and said, "Have you forgotten the pain you once had? Why can you be so calm."
　　 Cao Fenglin couldn't help Mo Xiu, he sighed and said, "Hey! I can answer your question just now, why this case is the same as it was six years ago."
　　 "Why?"
"The two things look similar, but the actual measurement is essentially different. Yang Qingfeng's current height is incomparable to me six years ago. The expression of the deceased before his death is also different. Six years ago he was attacked by a sneak attack. Now this time, the expression of the deceased before his death. Very angry, but there is no trace of fighting, more like an acquaintance."
　　Mo Xiu still doesn't understand what Cao Fenglin means. What does this mean?
　　 Cao Fenglin Youyou said: "Mo Xiu, I advise you again, don't investigate the thermal weapon, there is no result."
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Please answer!"
　　 "Hey, if the two things are related, it must be the latter imitating the former. Have you ever heard of imitation crime?"
　　 Mo Xiu had not come into contact with this knowledge, and shook his head.
　　 "Imitating crime means that the murderer is two people. The former commits a crime by one means, while the latter commits a crime by imitating the former. Generally, there are two motives for doing so, one is the blind worship of the former by the latter, and the other is..."
　　 Mo Xiu raised his head fiercely and said first: "The other is to cover up his criminal behavior and turn his attention to the former in order to achieve his own goals."
　　 Cao Fenglin nodded appreciatively and said: "Yes, this incident is likely to be like this."
　　 "Then who do you think the murderer is most likely to be?"
　　 Cao Fenglin smiled, showing rare confidence and said: "It's not possible. The murderer is Yang Qingfeng. If you have a motive and no evidence, you can investigate, but there will be no valuable clues at the end of the investigation."
　　 "Yang Qingfeng? This person is indeed a bit weird."
　　 "No doubt, if you want to investigate, just investigate him. I have checked it very clearly."
　　 "Teacher Cao, how did your information come from..."
　　 Cao Fenglin took out his mobile phone, tapped it at random, and pushed it to Mo Xiu.
　　 The familiar interface on the mobile phone is clearly the software of the shadow, and then look at the level, lv6.
　　My God, Mo Xiu has done so many tasks. Among them, there are two B-level tasks, which have just been upgraded to lv2. You can imagine how many tasks Cao Fenglin did, or what high-level tasks he did.
　　 Mo Xiu was a little embarrassed. Just now he even showed Cao Fenglin the Shadow Medal. Now it seems that he is just an axe.
　　 "Teacher Cao, don't you really help me investigate?"
　　 Cao Fenglin looked at the doorway, as if looking at Mu Mu.
　　 "Humans! You can't live in the past blindly. When you need to look forward, you must look forward, otherwise you will miss more."
　　 Mo Xiu can understand Cao Fenglin's feelings. After three years of painstaking investigations and three years of decadence, he finally had the hope of Mumu and didn't want to go back to the past.
　　 "Can you tell me the results of your investigation?"
　　 "There was no result. At the end of the investigation, all clues were broken."
　　 "If the clue is broken, I give up?"
  "Ok!"
  "I do not believe!"
　　 "Boy, believe it or not, you can go out!"
　　 Mo Xiu was mercilessly expelled from the door, Cao Fenglin must have concealed something, but it seems that he can't ask anymore.
　　 This time an unfamiliar girl was murdered. Next time, it might be someone he knew. When he thought of this, Mo Xiu still felt that he couldn't relax and decided to continue the investigation.
　　 Mo Xiu contacted Zheng Yi and asked Zheng Yi to keep an eye on Yang Qingfeng's movements, and immediately report whenever there is a turmoil.
　　 In the afternoon, the targeted training was carried out as usual. Thanks to the training during this period, all the effects of the spirit-gathering herbs were brought into full play. UU reading www.uukānshu. The basic capabilities of com Moxiu are approaching their limits.
　　 Mo Xiu's power is 701.243kg, and his speed is 4.012 seconds per 100 meters.
　　 The basic data of Mo Xiu who does not activate the descent of the Valkyrie basically reaches the data of the skill used when the skill was just awakened.
　　 In other words, the physical strength has increased by 100%, and Mo Xiu can definitely be regarded as a superman.
　　 This is not the limit of human beings. As long as the resources are sufficient, even without skills, a terrifying warrior can be created.
　　 A thought flashed through Mo Xiu's mind, the imperial children have unlimited resources, to what extent will their physical strength reach? Is it stronger than using Valkyrie's Arrival yourself?
　　 After the training was over, Mo Xiu looked at his phone. There were three missed calls from Zheng Yi. Could it be that Yang Qingfeng moved so quickly?
　　 Called back, Zheng Yi brought Mo Xiu good news.
　　It's bad because Yang Qingfeng has disappeared and the clue is completely broken. It is very difficult to continue the investigation.
　　Good because, according to Zheng Yi's investigation, Yang Qingfeng was taken away by three classrooms of Qingyun University. It should be the school that has also investigated something and took him away.
　　Thinking about it, Cao Fenglin and Mo Xiu can think of it, so would they not think of it in a big school?
　　 Now it is difficult to continue the investigation or want to know the follow-up. Qingyun University will definitely keep the secret and not spread it.
　　 Mo Xiu told Zheng Yi to continue to follow up, to see if he could see anything from the school's actions.
　　...
　　 On August 1, the school individual challenge qualifiers began.
　　 The four grades were conducted at the same time, and they shared six martial arts training grounds. Only then did Mo Xiu understand why Yanjing University had to build so many martial arts training grounds.
　　
    
   


　　 The first grade group was assigned to the No. 7 martial arts training ground. At this time, the second floor of the No. 7 martial arts training ground was completely opened up, and the walls of all the rooms slowly fell and were embedded in the ground.
　　This design is very novel, turning the entire second floor into a huge square.
　　 The lights in the arena shone, giving Mo Xiu a feeling of returning to the underground arena.
　　 There are only four competition venues in the center of the entire square, and the rest are all spectators.
　　 "Dear first-year students, the exciting time of the year has come. Some people are excited and nervous because they are promoted to the intramural competition, and some people can only become spectators because they have not been promoted."
　　 "But it doesn't matter, you still have a chance. As long as you stay competitive at any time, you will be in the center of the arena next year!!!"
　　 "Now! Whether you are a contestant or a spectator, let us enjoy this feast together, please enter the contestants!!!"
　　 "First of all, the strong attack department with the best overall score last year!!!"
　　Eight players walked to the center of the field and accepted the cheers of the audience.
　　 Next is the Elemental System, the Agile Attack System, the Ability System, and finally the auxiliary system where Mo Xiu is located.
　　The number of people in each department is different. There are eight players in the Assault Department, eight in the Elemental Department, six in the Agile Attack and Ability Departments, and four in the Auxiliary Department.
　　 There are 32 people in total, and the number of people in the competition is fixed at 32 people each year. The quota for each department this year is allocated according to the results of the previous year.
　　 In the first-year group of the individual heads-up competition last year, the total score of the attacking department and the elemental department was the top two, so eight places were allocated, and the auxiliary department was the bottom, so there were only four places.
　　 The rules of the individual heads-up match are very simple. Each player will play four matches with random opponents, and the top eight will be selected based on their results.
　　 In order to avoid the elimination of strong players and maintain fairness in the competition, there are seeded players in each department.
　　 Both the Strong Attack Department and the Elemental Department competed with eight players, so two seeded players can be selected, and the other three departments have only one seeded player.
　　 There are a total of seven seeds. These seven people will not meet to avoid the elimination of seed players.
　　 The individual heads-up competition is divided into four days. Everyone will have a game every day. The time will be tight. The tightness of the game is mainly to give students more preparation time and prepare for the team battle.
　　 It is worth mentioning that in other departments, Mo Xiu has two acquaintances, one is Liu Ziyang from the sensitive attack department, and the other is Zhou Qiuwu from the strong attack department.
Liu Ziyang’s skills are more suitable for team cooperation. The single body is not particularly strong, so it is not the strongest combat effectiveness of the agile attack system, but even so, he still fights and advances all the way, and the pressure during this period is also relatively high. This is how to contact Mo Xiu. s reason.
　　 And Zhou Qiuwu participated as a seeded player in the strong offensive system. Judging from the state of the eight players in the strong offensive system, Zhou Qiuwu was even faintly respected.
　　Mo Xiu knew very well that his strongest opponent was probably Zhou Qiuwu, who came from the same high school as himself.
　　 After all, it was the first day of the annual school civil war, and the host conducted another round of warm-up.
　　 Now the audience is basically all students from the same grade, and there are very few people from other grades.
　　Because the four grades of games are going on at the same time, everyone wants to pay more attention to their potential opponents and pay more attention to the games of the same grade.
　　 The host warmed up and explained the rules, and it took more than half an hour to start the game.
　　The opponents in the game are completely random, but the order of appearance can be arranged.
　　 The school put Zhou Qiuwu's game in a field to kick off the game.
　　 It can be seen that Zhou Qiuwu is very optimistic, and listening to the cheers on the scene, the popularity is also very high.
　　 The first four groups to play did not have Mo Xiu, which also gave Mo Xiu a chance to see Zhou Qiuwu's performance.
After 　　 shouted "The game begins!", the host never said a word. After all, it is a regular school game, which is different from an underground arena.
　　 The host of the underground arena will also keep talking during the battle to increase the mood of the audience, and the host of the regular game will keep quiet to avoid affecting the performance of the players.
　　 Although there are four groups of competitions, most people are attracted by Zhou Qiuwu.
　　 Zhou Qiuwu’s opponent was a classmate from the Min Attack Department. His opponent knew that Zhou Qiuwu was great, and he activated his skills at the beginning of the game and wanted to take the lead.
　　 The skill of this agile attack classmate is similar to a clone, forming a second self with extremely fast speed. Two selves can attack at the same time, one is virtual and the other is real. It is difficult to distinguish between the real and the real.
　　 Zhou Qiuwu activated the skill expressionlessly, spreading his hands to both sides, a luminous circle appeared on the ground, and a silver spear rose slowly in the circle.
　　 held the spear in his right hand and flicked it to his side, quite decisive before going into battle.
　　Mo Xiu will have a game for a while, so I didn't use God's Spy. I don't know if the skills are strong or not, but this is definitely the coolest skill effect Mo Xiu has ever seen.
　　With a weapon as a skill, Mo Xiu has never seen it before, but looking at the gorgeousness of the silver spear is definitely not easy.
　　 There is also that the use of weapons is not allowed in the game, but the skills of others are weapons, which is equivalent to reasonable cheating.
　　 Spears pay attention to flexibility. In Mo Xiu's understanding, the spear must be combined with agile posture and cannot be restricted by the spear. The spear should be used flexibly in order to win surprisingly.
　　 But Zhou Qiuwu didn't do this, let alone her body skills, Zhou Qiuwu didn't even move, his feet were as steady as roots, and he stuck his spear straight into the ground without waving his spear.
　　 At first Mo Xiu thought that Zhou Qiuwu didn't know how to use a spear~www.mtlnovel.com~ the spear should be armed.
　　 But the moment Zhou Qiuwu's spear moved, Mo Xiu knew that this person would be one of his strongest opponents in the four years of college.
　　 When the opponent was approaching Zhou Qiuwu, Zhou Qiuwu shot out quickly, making it impossible to see clearly, only a silver shadow flashed by.
　　 The opponent stood still, and Mo Xiu looked intently. The tip of the spear had already touched the opponent's throat. The opening battle, which had attracted much attention, ended simply.
　　 Zhou Qiuwu only used one move, a simple shot.
　　 Mo Xiu frowned in thought. Just now Zhou Qiuwu hadn't even looked at the opponent, he could tell the opponent's true body, it should be the spear skill that increased his perception ability.
　　 There is still speed, the speed of that shot is too fast, even Mo Xiu himself has no confidence to avoid it.
　　 "Gunsling Zhou Qiuwu! Powerful Zhou Qiuwu!"
　　 The overwhelming cheers filled the whole venue. In the noisy environment, Mo Xiu saw Zhou Qiuwu glance in his direction, but he didn't know if it was an illusion.
　　 Then there were two sets of competitions, each of which was very exciting. Mo Xiu also watched with gusto. The various skills and the flexible application of each skill were quite interesting to study.
　　 In the last four groups in the morning, Mo Xiu was named.
　　 "Next are the last four sets of duels in the morning. After these four sets are over, we will have a lunch break and continue in the afternoon. The next four sets are the auxiliary seed player Mo Xiu against the elemental Zhang He."
　　 After entering the field, Zhang He said: "Auxiliary system? There is no one who can play. Even if I am a seeded player, I am not afraid of you. Don't be beaten and cry by me for a while!"
　　 Mo Xiu smiled and replied, "Is there anything I can fight? Just try it."

 
       
 
           


　　 Mo Xiu directly launched God's spy.
　　"One skill: continuous flame bomb 2
　　 Skill effect: within five minutes, fire bombs can be fired twenty times to kill
　　Cooling time: six hours"
　　 If God's Spy has the worst detection effect on which skill, it must be an elemental skill.
　　 Because it is impossible to detect how strong the damage of elemental skills is.
  "Game start!"
　　As the host announced the start of the game, Zhang He flew towards Mo Xiu.
　　 It seems that Zhang He doesn't know about Mo Xiu. Most players will investigate the promotion players of other departments before participating in the competition.
　　 No matter how bad it is, it will investigate the strongest players in other departments and know whether the opponent is strong or weak.
　　 But the auxiliary department is an exception. If the auxiliary department is a little bit competitive in the team competition, that person's competition is basically for nothing.
　　 In previous competitions, even the seed players of the auxiliary department rarely advanced. The reason is simple. The biggest role of the auxiliary is to help the team win, singled out? nonexistent.
　　According to Mo Xiu's estimation, as long as he dodges Zhang He's flame bombs, he can achieve victory, so there is no rush to use skills.
　　 What makes Mo Xiu puzzled is that Zhang He's skills seem to be long-range skills, why should he rush to get closer?
　　 The next moment Mo Xiu understood, Zhang He's hands were claws, and flames appeared in his palms. This should be a flame bomb, but it didn't fire.
　　 It seems that Zhang He wants to hold flame bombs for melee combat. Interesting tactics, which can avoid the consumption of flame bombs, and can also use the high temperature of the flame to increase attack power.
　　 Zhang He hit with a claw, Mo Xiu stepped back and the flames passed in front of Mo Xiu.
　　 The temperature of the flame is not low, and it is estimated that the power of the flame bomb will not be small.
　　 After dodge a blow, Mo Xiu quickly rushed closer. The distance between the two was only a punch, so it was difficult for Zhang He to swing the flame to attack.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't punch either, but hit Zhang He's abdomen continuously with his elbow.
　　 Zhang He didn't expect that Mo Xiu would suddenly attack him, and he suffered these few attacks without precautions.
　　 After suffering this loss, Zhang He immediately retreated several steps, looking at Mo Xiu with some surprise.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't pursue it either, and wanted to see how Zhang He would respond next.
　　 Zhang He said: "I really didn't expect that a person of the auxiliary department should have such actual combat ability. Shouldn't the basic skills of auxiliary be escape and resist?"
　　 This is a misunderstanding of many people. They think that the job of assisting is to hide after releasing the assisting skills without pushing the hind legs.
　　 In fact, after Mo Xiu studied in the auxiliary department for a month, I found that most of the students were not bad in actual combat. Maybe they didn't have any martial arts moves, but they had solid foundations such as speed and strength.
　　 Mo Xiu replied: "I don't think you will run away, and you will not resist."
　　 Zhang He said excitedly: "You... your mouth is hard!"
After 　　 approached Mo Xiu, he attacked with the same claw as before.
　　 Mo Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly, as before, stepped back to avoid the blow.
　　 This time the flame stopped when it crossed Mo Xiu's face.
　　 "Whoo!"
　　 The flame bomb was fired at Mo Xiu's face. Mo Xiu had been prepared for a while, knowing that Zhang He used the same moves must be weird. It turned out that he was waiting here.
　　 The gunpowder shells were launched very quickly, but Moxiu responded in time, dodge the flame bombs with a backflip.
　　 As soon as the backflip landed, Zhang He took advantage of Mo Xiu's failure to stand still and fired six flame bombs in a row. The direction of the flame bombs almost surrounded Mo Xiu.
　　 The gunpowder bomb exploded when it touched the object. Six flame bombs exploded, making up for the smoke and dust of Mo Xiu's just standing position. Mo Xiu was not visible for a while.
　　 Zhang He excitedly raised his hands to celebrate the victory, and hit six flame bombs. Even Zhou Qiuwu could not be safe. He didn't expect to kill a seeded player in the first game. It was a good start.
　　 Zhang He shouted to the audience: "Ah!!! Remember me, my name is Zhang He! I will advance to the quarterfinals."
　　 The expressions of the audience were normal at first, and then slowly became sluggish. Zhang He looked back suspiciously.
　　 The smoke dissipated, and Mo Xiu's coat was burned torn, but it can be clearly seen that Mo Xiu was not injured at all.
　　 Zhang He looked at Mo Xiu like a ghost.
　　 "You... why are you okay? I see, your skill is healing."
　　 Mo Xiu looked at his embarrassed appearance, shook his head and said: "I didn't even release the skills, you have already begun to celebrate the victory? It is too light, you like people, you can't make the quarterfinals."
　　 Zhang He said angrily: "You shut up!"
　　 Then another flame bomb fired, and Mo Xiu quickly moved laterally to avoid it.
　　 Seeing Mo Xiu's speed more than doubled, Zhang He was a little confused.
　　 Just when Mo Xiu fired six flame bombs at Zhang He, he launched the Arrival of the Valkyrie. Although the speed of the flame bombs was fast, it was not as fast as a bullet.
　　 Mo Xiu can even dodge bullets, not to mention this flame bomb, if it weren't for testing the power of the flame bomb, the coat would not be damaged.
　　 Zhang He pointed to Mo Xiu and said: "Your speed has increased a lot. Support skills are absolutely impossible. Your skills are not support at all. You are agile attack skills."
　　 Mo Xiu thought of Yang Qingzhuo's abnormal skills, and said: "Can't do it? You can only say that your knowledge is too short, and my skills are not just to increase speed!"
　　 After Mo Xiu finished speaking, he didn't give Zhang He another chance. He kicked the ground forcefully with his feet, and attacked Zhang He at the fastest speed.
Zhang He saw Mo Xiu's speed at this moment a little flustered, his hands were put together, and about ten gunpowder bombs appeared between them~www.mtlnovel.com~ Mo Xiu immediately understood Zhang He's intentions and gathered ten flame bombs. Launch together to increase power.
　　 But Mo Xiu's speed was too fast. Before Zhang He could shoot out the flame in his hand, he had already come to Zhang He's side.
　　 said softly, "No matter how powerful it is, what's the point of being unable to hit people?"
　　 Mo Xiu punched Zhang He in the stomach. Zhang He's eyes bulged and he almost lost consciousness, and the flame bomb in his hand dissipated.
　　 After Zhang He realized what was wrong, he immediately opened his mouth and wanted to admit defeat. Mo Xiu didn't give him a chance and kicked him out of bounds, almost accidentally hurting the audience.
　　 Mo Xiu said coldly: "Don't underestimate the auxiliary system, what if there is a small auxiliary that can play?"
　　 Among the crowd, Zhou Qiuwu turned and left after seeing the result of the game.
　　......
　　 One day's game ended. The record of the four supporters was that Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan won, and Dong Fang and Xue Linger lost.
　　 This result is not unexpected. Xue Linger himself is an assistant, and it will definitely be worse than the students who are good at fighting in other departments.
　　 Dong Fang is not to mention, relying on his own report is the auxiliary department to be promoted, if the report is the storming department, it is basically impossible to advance.
　　 Liu Ziyang met an elemental seed player in the first battle, and unfortunately lost. In his own words, "I'm unlucky!"
　　Mo Xiu returned home, Yang Qingzhuo was eating hot pot with Xiao Fushun.
　　 "Why don't you wait for me to eat hot pot?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo said playfully: "I wanted to wait for you, but the two of us couldn't help it!"
　　 Xiao Fushun became more and more human, and nodded in cooperation.
　　 "Mo Xiu, how was your game today?"
　　 "Won! Let's eat!"

　　 These celestial physiques are good at Xiao Fushun, from the size of the original palm to the size of the arm.
　　It's not just a head, but also curiosity. Xiao Fushun is very naughty these days, playing around.
　　 Originally, Yang Qingzhuo wanted to follow Mo Xiu to the school to watch the game, but Mo Xiu couldn't worry about Xiao Fushun, fearing that something might happen to him, so Yang Qingzhuo stayed at home and watched him.
The relationship between the two is also very good. After all, they have a common hobby...Eating meat, eating hot pot every day these days, one day without eating meat, Yang Qingzhuo actually took Xiao Fushun on a hunger strike to protest, and Mo Xiu was very miserable. Words.
　　 Not long after, Zheng Yi came back and asked as soon as he came back: "Mo Xiu, how is your game? No shame, right?"
　　 Mo Xiu smiled and said, "Don't worry, it won't be ashamed."
　　 "That's good, I have heard an inside story, would you like to listen to it?"
　　 "If you have something to say, there is..."
　　 Zheng Yi smiled mysteriously, and said happily, "Don't you want to know about Yang Qingfeng?"
　　 "Tell me, I'll invite you to hot pot."
　　 Zheng Yi rolled his eyes and said: "Are you sure you are inviting me? Forget it, since you are good to me, I will tell you."
　　 "I found out that Yang Qingfeng was found to be the murderer. He was suspected in the past. Now the school has found evidence, which is said to be a murder weapon."
　　 "A pistol?"
　　 "Yes, with a pistol, Yang Qingfeng and Zhang Nana have always had conflicts, Zhang Nana greened Yang Qingfeng, and then..."
　　 Looking at Zheng Yi's lewd smile, Mo Xiu immediately interrupted: "Okay, you don't need to talk about this, continue to talk about business."
　　 "I heard that Yang Qingzhuo had premeditated the murder of Zhang Nana, and deliberately invited Zhang Nana to the back of the teaching building to commit the murder without anyone knowing."
　　 Mo Xiu made a pistol gesture with his right hand and said, "Then what's the source of this?"
　　 Zheng Yi shook his head and said, "Yang Qingfeng would not say that he was killed. It is also possible that the source did not want to tell me."
　　 This news seems to be useful, but in fact it only confirmed Cao Fenglin's statement. Without knowing the source of the pistol, the clue is still broken.
　　 However, Zheng Yi's ability to inquire about news is really strong, and he competes with Hao Ren.
　　 Although Zheng Yi was considered a rich child, he did not bother to fool around with friends and friends, and had very few friends in high school.
　　 But now, in order to chase his goddess, Zheng Yi socializes with people and asks news about the goddess.
　　 Mo Xiu has only seen photos of the goddess Zheng Yi, never seen a real person, and don't know what kind of person is Zheng Yi's fascination.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't ask any more, everyone sat down to eat together.
　　 I have been eating meat for some time recently. Because of the school competition, Mo Xiu didn't have time to do tasks, so he was struggling to make ends meet.
　　 Fortunately, Zheng Yi and Liu Ziyang are two rich second generations to fill up, otherwise Mo Xiu's money may be spent.
　　 Xiao Fushun is a bit weird, saying he is not a cat, right? All forms, including calls, are very similar. Say he is a cat, right? The black stripes on the back are a bit mysterious.
　　 I don’t know if Xiao Fushun has talent skills. If so, why hasn’t it been revealed yet?
　　 speechless all night.
　　 In the early morning of the next day, Mo Xiu came to the training ground on his own.
　　 Mumu explained yesterday that before today's game, come to the department arena first.
　　 Mo Xiu came a little early, when only Mu Mu was alone.
　　 Mumu was writing something on the table, his expression was so serious that Mo Xiu didn't notice it when he came in.
　　 Mo Xiu did not disturb her, and sat down opposite her.
　　 Watching Mumu write and draw in the notebook, it should be a summary of yesterday's game.
　　 Mu Mu's eyes and pens swiftly wrote, frowning for a while like something incredible happened, and then letting out a sigh of relief, as if breaking through a certain problem.
　　 suddenly raised his head to find that Mo Xiu was looking at him.
　　 "Mo Xiu, you are here, wait a while, when they come, I will say it together."
　　 Mo Xiu nodded, and gestured to Mumu to continue.
　　 Five minutes later, several others arrived.
　　 Mumu stood up and said, "I'm sorry to find you all early in the morning. I watched each of you's game yesterday and want to say a few words."
"Dong Fang, your advantage is your defensive power. Yesterday, you had no choice but to be at a disadvantage against those from the Strong Attack Department. You are most hopeful of defeating classmates from the Agile Attack and Elemental Departments. After this period of training, your speed improves Many, most of the agile attacks have insufficient attack power. You have the advantage. As for the elemental system, most people can only activate the skill once. Try to avoid it. If you can't avoid it, it depends on whether you can resist it."
　　 "Xiao Lan, the willpower training during this period of time seems to have no effect on you. I was rather disappointed in your match yesterday. I didn't show the fighting spirit that I should have. I hope that the next match can improve."
　　 "Xue Ling'er, you are at a disadvantage..."
　　 "Mo Xiu, keep it up. You won't encounter seeded players from other departments. It's relatively stable. There is no problem with normal performance and promotion."
　　 Next, Mu Mu analyzed for everyone, how to deal with different types of opponents, very detailed.
　　 Mo Xiu admired this girl from the bottom of his heart, being serious and responsible, working hard and being positive, no wonder he could help Cao Fenglin out.
Mu Mu was in charge of team battles. Cao Fenglin meant that team battles were the main focus. She could have ignored the four individual heads-up matches, but she still did a lot for the four. Everyone knows that her good intentions come from Inner gratitude.
　　 After the explanation, the five people came to the competition field of the No. 7 martial arts training ground.
　　 Today is the second game. After listening to Mu Mi's analysis and mobilization before the game, everyone is very motivated.
　　 Today, the host did not warm up, and immediately announced the start of the game as soon as the time was up~www.mtlnovel.com~ Moxiu was scheduled to play last, so that he would have time to watch the match of the people he followed.
　　 Zhou Qiuwu was still the first player to play. The school seemed to have intentionally placed him to the top. The battle process was still that simple, and the battle ended with just one shot.
　　 I originally wanted to see Zhou Qiuwu's second skill, but I didn't see it, which is a pity.
After 　　 is Liu Ziyang, this time it is an elemental player.
　　 Liu Ziyang has a speed advantage, relatively restrains his opponents, and wins relatively easily.
　　 According to his own words, "feng shui turns around".
　　 Then it was Dong Fang and Xue Ling'er. They used Mu Mu's tactics to fight to the end, but unfortunately they lost because of insufficient strength.
　　 Even if two people lost, they didn't make the opponents feel better. At the last minute of the fight, the two opponents were unhappy to win.
　　 In the end, it was Xiao Lan. Xiao Lan met the seeded player of the superpower, and the battle was extremely fierce.
　　 The opponent was only on the front line better than Xiao Lan, Xiao Lan did not show the desire to win, and still did not launch the blue flame.
　　 Mo Xiu couldn't understand Xiao Lan more and more. If he said that he didn't shoot flames to hide his strength, then why did he show no fighting spirit throughout the game?
　　 Then Xiao Lan was forced out of bounds. Once he lost this game, he basically missed the quarterfinals.
　　 Mo Xiu felt it was a pity, Xiao Lan definitely had the strength of the quarterfinals.
　　 Mu Mu was even more disappointed, shaking his head and sighing.
　　 In the end, it was Mo Xiu's turn to play. The opponent was still an elemental player named He Xu.
　　 He Xu obviously heard some wind, knowing that Mo Xiu is very strong and difficult to deal with, and his expression is very serious.
　　 Mo Xiu was helpless, why did he tie up with the element?

　　"One skill: Fury Tornado 2
　　 Skill effect: Summon a tornado with a diameter of 30 meters, and perform a stun and continuous damage to the involved target
　　 chanting time: two seconds
　　 Duration: Five seconds
　　Cooling time: three hours"
　　 Mo Xiu released God's Spy to He Xu as usual, and was surprised when he saw the effect of the skill.
　　 Although I don't know the duration of the stun and the level of damage, it is very scary just from the scope of the skill.
　　 The entire field is only fifty meters, and the diameter of the tornado is thirty meters. As long as He Xu releases his skills, he basically cannot avoid it.
　　 However, He Xu's skills also have weaknesses, that is the singing time that first appeared. This singing time is the time from the release of the skill to the appearance of the tornado.
  "Game start!"
　　 Mo Xiu was ready to launch a fierce attack at the beginning of the game, and ended the game within He Xu's singing time.
　　 This way, you can avoid trouble and win the game in the safest way.
　　 In the first time the game started, Mo Xiu launched the Arrival of the Valkyrie and moved forward at full speed.
　　 But Mo Xiu had miscalculated, who can enter the school selection, which is not superior in strength, let alone a big element like the element system.
　　 He Xu knows the weakness of his skills. He has been observing the host just now, but he released his skills before the start of the game. As soon as the host’s voice fell, the singing time was over, and a tornado appeared on the ground.
　　 Mo Xiu found out that something was wrong when he ran two steps, a tornado rose under his feet, and he was at the center of the tornado. It seemed that He Xu had planned for it a long time ago.
　　 For an instant, Mo Xiu reacted. At this time, it was impossible to run out of the tornado range. The improvement was to retreat and stay away from He Xu as much as possible.
　　Because he doesn't know the duration of the tornado's stun, he must avoid doing secondary damage to himself when he is stunned.
　　 The wind rose rapidly and quickly, and it directly lifted Mo Xiu into the air. At this moment, Mo Xiu felt that his brain stopped for less than a second. It seemed that he was dizzy.
　　 Mo Xiu was swept to the center of the tornado, and the wind around him was as strong as a knife.
　　 "Huh!" The clothes on Mo Xiu's shoulder were torn.
　　 "Huh!" The trousers at the ankle were torn apart.
　　 Five seconds later, the wind stopped, and Mo Xiu slowly fell to the ground, his clothes in tatters.
　　 Fortunately, the wind blade did not break through the defense, and Mo Xiu was not injured.
　　Although he was not injured, Mo Xiu had a lingering fear. The damage of the wind blade just couldn't break the defense. If the damage was stronger, Mo Xiu would be in a panic.
　　 Mo Xiu sighed and took it carelessly. If you think of the opponent's tactics before the start of the game, you may be able to avoid being hit and winning will be much easier.
　　 The wind dissipated completely, and Mo Xiu walked towards He Xu step by step.
　　 He Xu shook his head helplessly, and shouted to the host: "I give up!"
　　 then said to Mo Xiu: "I didn't expect that there would be someone like you in the auxiliary department."
　　 Mo Xiu spread his hands and said: "This year's auxiliary department will surprise you."
　　 He Xu clasped his fists and said, "I'm waiting to see!"
　　 The game is over. Today, Mo Xiu is the last game. It was a bit late to get home. Yang Qingzhuo and Zheng Yi and Xiao Fushun were waiting in front of the hot pot as soon as they entered the door.
　　 Seeing Yang Qingzhuo's appearance, the drool came out.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo saw Mo Xiu's clothes all in ragged clothes, and asked concerned: "Mo Xiu, are you okay? Yesterday, the clothes were broken, and they are broken today!"
　　 Zheng Yi mocked on the side: "Mo Xiu, your game costs a lot of clothes! How is the game?"
　　 "There is no problem in the game, I won, but why did you eat hot pot again? Aren't you tired of eating?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo and Xiao Fushun had already started at this time, and they had no time to pay attention to Mo Xiu.
　　 Zheng Yi said, "What are you tired of? Eating meat is not greasy. Besides, it used to be a clear soup pot, today is a spicy pot, come and eat!
　　Mo Xiu went back to the room and changed a set of clothes. He returned to the kitchen. He just sat down and saw that Xiao Fushun was eating Hesai with a chopstick on his head.
　　 "Spicy, eat less, forget your diarrhea?"
　　 "Meow...!"
　　 Xiao Fushun snarled at Mo Xiu, and Mo Xiu was dissatisfied with revealing his shortcomings.
　　 Mo Xiu rubbed Xiao Fushun's head vigorously, stunned Xiao Fushun, and continued to eat meat after a while.
　　 In the next third and fourth day of battle, Mo Xiu won without any suspense, and every opponent was not weak.
　　The record of the four players in the auxiliary department is Mo Xiu four wins and zero losses, Xiao Lan three wins and one loss, Dong Fang one wins and three losses, and Xue Linger zero wins and four losses.
At the end of the game, the host said: "The school individual competition qualifiers are over. Every player has done their best to contribute to us one after another wonderful duel. Please wait a moment. The staff is counting the results. The quarterfinals will be announced for everyone later."
　　 In fact, if someone with a heart records their record, they already know who will advance.
　　 Mo Xiu has four wins and zero losses. He is also a seeded player. He is very stable in the quarterfinals, so he is not worried at all.
　　 Ten minutes later, the results came out, which was a little surprising. There were seven seeded players in total, and six were promoted. One seed player was eliminated, and he was still a seeded player in the storming department.
　　 Among the eight players who were promoted, there was a strong attack type, that is, Zhou Qiuwu, two element type seed players, one agile attack type seed player, three ability type players, and Mo Xiu, an auxiliary type seed player.
　　 This result surprised everyone. The strongest assault system was only promoted by one person. Last year, the second-to-last ability system had a total score of last year, killing a seed of the assault system and was promoted to three.
　　Mo Xiu was also very puzzled. There was no power system among his four opponents, so he didn't know what was going on.
　　 asked the people around, they were basically confused.
　　 At this moment, Mo Xiu called Hao Ren. This know-it-all should know what's going on, right?
　　 Hao Ren did not disappoint Mo Xiu~www.mtlnovel.com~ Tell Mo Xiu the real reason.
　　 After hearing the reason, Mo Xiu praised the leader of the power department as a tactical ghost.
The reason for the sudden emergence of the 　　 ability system is simple, the suppression of the number of skills.
　　 The Ability Department selected two students whose birthdays were before August 1. In other words, before the start of the school heads-up match, these two people already possessed two skills.
In the past, other departments have tried this method, but it is not ideal, because there are not many birthdays before August 1, and there may not necessarily be strong students. There is uncertainty, and no one can predict. The strength of the second skill, if the person's awakening second skill is very weak, then the gain is not worth the loss.
　　 But this year, I was hit by a dead mouse by the blind cat of the ability department. The two students with birthdays before August are not weak, and the second skills of awakening are very strong.
　　 In the absence of an absolute advantage, two skills can definitely suppress one skill. This is also the reason why the school encourages competitions but protects the lower grades.
　　 These two powers are dark horses, and they have won all four games and are invincible.
　　 That strong offensive seed player was also unlucky, both of these dark horses were met by him, and he lost two games in a row and missed the quarterfinals.
　　 When the top eight list was all, there was an unexpected joy, Mo Xiu couldn't believe his ears.
　　 Du Ya, the strongest member of the society, has entered the quarterfinals, the unruly woman, the woman who dismissed Mo Xiu.
　　 The two looked at each other, and Mo Xiu could see the shock in Du Ya's eyes.
　　 The reason why Duya joined the strongest club is very simple. Instead of participating in the selection, she directly participates in the club heads-up competition.
　　 From the beginning to the end, there is no hope for the team battle of the club. Seeing that Mo Xiu has also made the quarterfinals, there may be hope for the team battle...
　　

    
   


　　 On August 5th, Mumu announced a holiday. First, there is still nearly a month before the team battle in the school. There is no need to train every day, and the second is to give time to the students participating in the club battle.
　　 Finally free time, Mo Xiu waved his hand, preparing to perform his duties as the president of the society, the general meeting.
　　 This conference was a success because even Du Ya was here.
　　 Du Ya changed her attitude of not waiting to see Mo Xiu, and she started to face Mo Xiu.
　　 When everyone asked about the reason for the change in attitude, she only left one famous quote.
　　 "Only the strong are worthy of respect."
　　 This obviously recognizes Mo Xiu's strength and agrees with the president of Mo Xiu's strongest society to hold a meeting for everyone.
　　 Hao Ren, Liu Ziyang, Yang Qingzhuo, Dong Fang, He Lingyue and Du Ya sat in their seats.
　　 Mo Xiu talked at the front.
　　 "As the president of the strongest club, individual heads-up matches and team matches are not far away. I decided to start training."
　　 Several people off the field were very surprised. The strongest club is actually going to train. This is really the sun rising from the west.
　　 Mo Xiu continued: "Yenching University's education method is competition education. I appreciate this kind of competition method, but I think it is still somewhat inadequate."
　　 Hao Ren asked with a serious face: "President, what are the shortcomings of this kind of education? It is full of competition and can help everyone grow quickly. I think the way of competition education is at least one or two grades ahead of other universities."
"Vice President Hao is right. As a school, this method is really good. But if you want to make real progress, I feel that the pressure of competition is not enough, and there is a sense of crisis. If you are careless, you will be seriously injured. sense."
　　 The others were still a little dazed, and He Lingyue was the first to react.
　　 "Mo Xiu, I think you have taken another task, do you want everyone to complete it together?"
Mo Xiu corrected: "What you said is not entirely correct. I took the task that needs everyone to complete together, but the order is wrong. I don't want everyone to complete the task after receiving the task, but I want to hone everyone. The actual combat ability and team cooperation can only take on the task."
　　 As soon as these words came out, the six people believed that there were two factions, one faction was Dong Fang, Yang Qingzhuo and Du Ya, and they believed what Mo Xiu said.
　　 Dong Fang is simple-minded, he didn't think so much, Yang Qingzhuo is Mo Xiu's little fan, and believes everything.
　　 And Du Ya simply didn't understand Mo Xiu, and didn't know that Mo Xiu, who usually looks serious, would occasionally make comparisons.
　　The other faction is He Lingyue, Liu Ziyang, and Hao Ren. Mo Xiu's words are too false. It must be for points and cash to pull them into the water.
　　 But no matter which faction it is, there is no objection to Mo Xiu's proposal.
　　 At this time, everyone has some time. After the formation of the group of seven, they haven't acted together. Everyone still doesn't understand very well, so I took this opportunity to get to know each other.
　　 Looking at the people with different expressions in the audience, Mo Xiu said nonchalantly: "Since there is no opinion, then it is decided."
　　 Then he took out six documents and handed them to everyone in charge. These are the task information.
　　 The two previous large-scale missions, one was the underground arena, and the other was to capture Wang Jinyang, both of which were investigative missions.
　　 This time is different, this time it's simple and rude, killing the mission.
　　 Open the first page of the information.
　　"Extermination mission: "Catfish"
　　 Difficulty level: C
　　 Mission fulfillment conditions: kill or capture all members.
　　 Task reward: 2000 points, 1 million cash reward (for every member who escapes, 15% of the reward will be deducted). "
　　"Extermination mission: bandit "Black Hand Cao Xiao" gang
　　 Task level: B
　　Task details:......"
　　 I read the information again. There are a total of 27 missions. Most of the missions are C and D in difficulty. There is part B. Several people in the strongest community should be able to cope.
The targets of the mission are some marginalized people who gather together to commit crimes. These should have been the work of law enforcement teams, but since the emergence of skills, the crime rate has increased, and some people’s skills are suitable for crime and it is difficult to catch them. .
　　 Therefore, the focus of the law enforcement team is to ensure safety in the city. Such organizations will appear in some unmanned areas outside the city.
　　 Hao Ren asked in surprise: "President, have you taken all these 27 tasks?"
　　 Mo Xiu nodded and said, "Yes, the mission time limit is two months, there should be no problem."
　　 Liu Ziyang said with some worry: "These organizations have people, we only have one skill, can it work?"
Du Ya said: "Why not? If we can go to Yenching University, it proves to be better than them. If they really have the strength, they will be classmates with us. I agree with Mo Xiu's decision and decided to perform the task with the team. "
　　 The first person to stand up to support Mo Xiu turned out to be the least familiar Du Ya, and Mo Xiu was also a little strange.
　　 He Lingyue also said: "I agree. Last time we completed the Wang Jinyang mission together, I think it is very helpful to everyone's growth. This is something that the school competition cannot bring us, and I agree."
　　 The two women stood up to express their opinions, and everyone else also supported them. Only Yang Qingzhuo did not speak.
　　 But it doesn't matter, Yang Qingzhuo listens to Mo Xiu everything and doesn't need to express his opinions.
　　Mo Xiu was very satisfied with everyone's response. In fact, in taking these tasks this time, I really want to improve my actual combat ability. It cannot be said that the competition is not actual combat, but after all, it lacks the sense of urgency when it is true.
　　 "Everyone passed unanimously, UU read www.uukanshu.com, then find a gang to try today?"
 "no problem!"
 "it is good!"
　　 "I can't wait!"
　　......
　　 In the evening, seven members of the strongest club returned to the club activity room.
　　 Today, it took a whole day to destroy a small gang, a total of eight people, and the task level is D.
　　 Duya first said: "We were all blocking these eight people in the room originally, Dong Fang, you were responsible for blocking the door, where did you go? If not for the four people, would we be so strenuous?"
　　 Dong Fang said aggrieved: "I am responsible for blocking the door, but I saw someone trying to run from the window, so I stopped that person. Why don't you talk about Yang Qingzhuo and Liu Ziyang who are in charge of the pursuit?"
Liu Ziyang wasn't very happy either. He sighed and said, "Hey, I was entangled at the time. That kid... he was all tricks. If I was careless, I would die. "
　　 This time the task was finally completed, but it was a little embarrassing.
　　 exposed the problem of the lack of tacit understanding of the strongest associations, but the root cause of the unsuccessful task is that everyone thinks too simple.
　　 The real combat is based on fate. There are no space restrictions. People can run at will if they can't fight. There are no rules and restrictions. There are all kinds of weapon traps, and even tricks are frequently used.
　　 Everyone who has not been exposed to this type of combat is very uncomfortable, including Mo Xiu.
　　 Now everyone is talking about each other, it's a mess.
Mo Xiu shouted: "Okay, everyone, stop, stop arguing. There are two things that have not been done in this mission. One is that there is no perfect plan. This is my responsibility, and the other is that we do not have them. Treat them as wicked people and treat them as students."
　　 
       
 
           


　　 Hao Ren asked: "Our mission is not going well this time, will it be dangerous if we continue to do the mission?"
　　 He Lingyue also said anxiously: "Yes, anyway, after all, we are going to focus on the competition. If we get injured in order to perform the task, then the gain will not be worth the loss."
　　 Mo Xiu spread his hands and said, "Do you think the task was unsuccessful? I think it was very successful."
　　 Everyone looked at Mo Xiu with strange eyes. Is this still successful? Such a small task is almost impossible to complete.
　　 Mo Xiu saw that everyone had no confidence, and said with a sad expression: "Hey! You guys have disappointed me too much!"
　　 Everyone is even more confused now, where are all these?
　　 "Have you forgotten that when we had a meeting in the morning, everyone unanimously decided on the purpose of the extermination mission?"
　　 "It's for training! It's just because the performance of the first mission was not good, it proved that it really played a training role. We found a place to improve, which was very successful."
　　 Mo Xiu shook his head disappointedly.
　　 "Hey! You see your weaknesses and know how to make progress, but you want to give up? So without fighting spirit, are you embarrassed to say that you are a student of Yenching University?"
　　 The six people were a little embarrassed by Mo Xiu. Although they felt that something was wrong, they did say that it made sense. How could they give up when there is an opportunity for improvement.
　　 Mo Xiu stood up, left a word and walked out of the classroom.
　　 "Assemble here at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning. If you go back, think about it. Those who want to continue the eradication mission should be on time. Those who don't want to come... hey!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo saw that Mo Xiu was gone, and ran out with him.
　　 Liu Ziyang and Mo Xiu are all the way, and they both want to go back to the Genting Villa area in Qiangzi’s car, and then go out.
　　 Dong Fang, He Lingyue, Hao Ren and Du Ya looked at each other.
　　 In the end, Hao Ren said in a low voice: "I heard that there is an organization called pyramid schemes. I am a little skeptical now. I have been brainwashed and can no longer think about problems normally."
　　......
　　 The next morning, August 6th, the strongest club activity room.
　　 At eight o'clock, Mo Xiu opened the door on time and smiled with satisfaction when he saw everyone there.
　　 Hao Ren said immediately: "Okay, Chairman, you don't need to say those inciting emotions, just a word, can we still not participate in the mission?"
　　 Moxiu laughed and said: "Hahaha, that's good, let's go! Try to do a few more tasks today."
　　 Since yesterday's mission was not smooth, Mo Xiu mainly chose the D-level mission today, which is less difficult, so he should practice his hand first.
　　 Today’s first task, Mo Xiu has made a detailed plan. Everyone is responsible for a clear task. If one person has an emergency, who can support and who can’t support, all arrangements are made.
　　 This time it was a ten-member organization. All ten of them were students who had not been admitted to the university. They were not guilty of death, so Mo Xiu ordered them all to be captured alive.
　　 This mission went smoothly. It only took one hour to capture all ten people, but it was also the simplest mission.
　　 A total of five D-level missions were completed that day, and it was also all D-level missions.
　　After one day's tasks were completed, seven people gradually formed a system.
　　 In preparation work, Hao Ren is responsible for collecting intelligence and selecting tasks, Mo Xiu and He Lingyue are responsible for arranging tactics based on existing intelligence, Dong Fang and Liu Ziyang are responsible for logistics, and Yang Qingzhuo and Du Ya are responsible for trophy collection.
　　 In the field of battle, Dong Fang was no longer responsible for blocking the door and changed to Vanguard.
　　 Duya is strong, responsible for the main attack, and is the person with the highest output on the battlefield.
　　 He Lingyue uses skills to judge the situation on the field and is responsible for on-site command.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo and Liu Ziyang were the fastest and were responsible for the pursuit.
　　 Mo Xiu is a free man.
　　 This kind of distribution was not planned, but a day's battle experiment.
　　 In just one day, the seven members of the strongest club transformed from a rush into an impeccable team.
　　 During this period, Mo Xiu also read Du Ya's skills.
　　"One Skill: Five Elements Armor 3
　　 Skill effect: Fully wrapped armor covers the whole body, and the armor is divided into five forms, which can be switched freely.
　　 (Gold Form: Defense power increased by 100%, attack power increased by 400%.)
　　 (Wood form: 100% increase in defense, with skills, savage growth, and throwing seeds that can grow rapidly.)
　　 (Water form: 100% increase in defense power, with skills, healing.)
　　 (Fire form: increase defense 100%, attack power 300%, additional skills, burn.)
　　 (Soil form: increase defense power by 800%, reduce speed by 60%.)
　　 Duration: Five minutes
　　Cooling time: two hours"
　　 is an extremely abnormal and comprehensive skill, which can be reported to the assault system. The only drawback is that the skill lasts for a relatively short time.
　　 It seems that if you can enter the quarterfinals of the individual heads-up at Yenching University, there will be absolutely no weak.
　　 In the evening, several people returned to the activity room as usual to summarize.
　　 As soon as Dong Fang sat down, he said, "Happy, really happy, I'm going to hit ten tomorrow."
　　 Liu Ziyang slapped him and said, "Don’t blow up. Today is all D-level missions. I will start C-level missions tomorrow. You are a pioneer, don’t let people have a swollen nose and swollen nose."
　　 Everyone laughed. The atmosphere today is obviously much better than yesterday. What’s more important is that in this day’s time, everyone’s tacit understanding and...friendship have been strengthened.
　　 Watching everyone chat in full swing, Mo Xiu didn't say a word. He just wanted to watch this scene quietly, watching his team so harmonious.
　　......
　　 The strongest community is as powerful as a broken bamboo. It has completed ten C-level missions in seven days, a total of 27 missions, and eight C-level and three B-level missions are left.
　　 August 14th, tomorrow is the qualifier for the Community Personal Challenge~www.mtlnovel.com~ so today we will have a day off.
　　 These days, the bonds of the strongest society members have deepened, and it is easier to produce strong friendships in real battles. Even Duya, who has not been very easy to get along with, has been mingling with other people during this time.
　　 The landlord Liu Ziyang took everyone around in Yanjing, and Mo Xiu invited everyone to dinner in the evening.
　　 When Mo Xiu asked everyone what they wanted to eat, several people said they wanted hot pot.
　　 was rejected by Mo Xiu, it doesn’t matter whether it’s expensive or not, it doesn’t matter whether it’s delicious or not, as long as it’s not a hot pot...
　　 On August 15, the community war officially opened.
　　 The venue of the community battle is the same as the individual battle in the school, on the second floor of the No. 7 martial arts training ground.
　　 However, the community war is obviously not as formal as the school civil war, and it is more like a large gathering.
　　 sells peripherals, sells player information, and even sells the beauty rankings of Yenching University.
　　 Mo Xiu, out of curiosity, yes, just curiosity, went to look at the booth of this guy who sells beauty rankings.
When the old man saw someone coming, he immediately introduced: "Brother, know the goods, I have a full list of beautiful women, what is the first imperial sister Xiao Hong, the first young sister Xiao Lan, I also have private photos of the two sisters, How's it going? Get a copy?"
　　 Mo Xiu didn't find it interesting, so he stood up and left.
The stall owner immediately said: "Brother don’t go, you don’t like being mature. I still have a loli stick. We have a loli in the first grade. Yang Qingzhuo from the auxiliary department, but I heard that she recognizes a man named Mo Xiu. The kid is the master, hey, what a pity."
　　 Mo Xiu's face turned black when he heard this.
　　 "Brother, are you uncomfortable? Huh? How do I think you are familiar, you are... you are Mo Xiu!"
　　 The stall owner tremblingly pointed at Mo Xiu and said.
    
   


　　 Mo Xiu showed a harmless smile and said, "I'm sorry, you have admitted the wrong person."
　　 is about to leave after speaking, the stall owner hugged Mo Xiu's thigh from behind and said, "Brother Mo Xiu, I didn't mean it, please let me go, I will delete Yang Qingzhuo."
　　 "I said everything, I'm not Mo Xiu."
　　 "Don't lie to me, I didn't recognize it just now."
　　 Mo Xiu squatted down and said, "What if I am Mo Xiu? Why are you so afraid of me."
　　 The stall owner swallowed, and was afraid to speak.
　　 Mo Xiu said: "It's okay, tell me, I'm very approachable."
　　 The stall owner still didn't dare to speak, Mo Xiu's eyes stood up and shouted, "Say!"
The stall owner was so frightened that he knelt on the ground, begging for mercy and said: "I said, I said, now the whole school is rumoring that you are the Demon King. Not only are you strong and powerful, but you also have a deep background. Even Liu Ziyang has a strong background. Call you the boss."
　　 Mo Xiu curled his lips. He didn't expect his own style to be like this, hey!
　　 ignored the stall owner, turned and left.
　　 The stall owner sat on the ground for a long time before returning to his stall to sit down. After thinking for a while, he opened his notebook and wrote a sentence.
　　 "The Great Demon King Mo Xiu, angered the slave girl Yang Qingzhuo and beat up innocent traders!"
　　 Mo Xiu circled the scene and found that in addition to third-party vendors, there were official gambling games.
　　 Hosted by the organizer’s student union, with diverse gameplay, champion betting, semi-final betting, eight-final betting, and top 16 betting, you can push your optimistic people into the top sixteen, and you can even bet on the ownership of the champion.
　　 The most common thing is to bet on the outcome of a single game, but the game has not yet started, and I don’t know the situation of the match, so the single game is still open.
　　 Now only the top 16 can bet. Mo Xiu originally wanted to push himself into the top 16, but was told that the prediction of the top 16 could not overpower himself, and he was not allowed to bet on the outcome of a single game.
　　 After a brief look, Mo Xiu felt that it was meaningless, so he returned to the war zone.
　　 At this time, the seven members of the strongest club are all here. Liu Ziyang said: "Boss, this game is about to start, you are still going out."
　　 "I'll find out about the enemy!"
　　 Hao Ren said with a look of disbelief: "President, with all due respect, you haven't probed the enemy."
　　 Although the venue has not changed, there are still some differences between the site layout and the intramural competition.
　　 The intramural competition has only four venues, four games are held at the same time, there is no referee, while the club competition is ten venues at the same time, each venue is a referee, the referee is a member of the student union.
　　 Mo Xiu also saw an acquaintance in the referee team, and that was Mu Mu. He didn't expect Mu Mu to be a member of the Student Union.
　　 glanced at the time, there was still some time before the game, Mo Xiu stepped forward to say hello.
　　 "Mumu, I didn't see it. You are a member of the student council and you are a referee. You can turn to me a little bit later."
　　 Mumu saw that it was Mo Xiu, and said grandiosely: "No problem, but with your strength, I shouldn't be able to help."
　　 "Why did you come to be a referee?"
　　 "My club is Suzaku. As you know, the competition is fierce. I didn't choose it. Since I can't play, I might as well be a referee. More knowledge and knowledge can improve my understanding of various skills."
　　 Mo Xiu chatted for a while before returning to his seat.
　　 For Mumu, Mo Xiu has always admired him, he has goals and pursuits!
　　 "Hello everyone! The annual club war has opened!!!"
"This year's number of participants set a record. A total of 527 people participated in the heads-up competition, and 74 teams participated in the team competition. I heard from the predecessors that only 15 people participated in the first team competition, and it can grow to the current scale. , Each of us should be proud."
　　 After a series of opening warm-ups, the host explained the rules. The winning and losing rules are the same as the school civil war. The promotion rules are simpler and more rude, and the knockout matches.
　　 From the qualifiers to the finals, the whole process is one-on-one elimination.
　　 The organizer's Student Union does not want to make the competition more reasonable. There are so many participants that it can only be used for knockouts.
　　 Club battles are not like intramural competitions, where there are tiered selections for class competitions and departmental competitions. There are only 32 people in the school competition.
　　The registration rules for the club battle are that as long as it is a regular club, you can sign up. If the number of applicants is too small, the competition will be unsightly. In addition to the large number of clubs, there will of course be too many participants.
　　 A total of more than 500 people participated, even if it is a knockout, it takes five rounds to advance to the top 16.
　　 Then the official game will start. Because there are too many people, Mo Xiu has no chance to play this day.
　　 The first day of the strongest club's record was that Du Ya and Yang Qingzhuo advanced to the second round, Dong Fang and Hao Ren were eliminated, He Lingyue and Liu Ziyang, like Mo Xiu, did not play.
　　 Just the first day, and the first round has not ended, the strongest club has eliminated two people, which really made Mo Xiu a little unexpected.
　　 And Dong Fang and Hao Ren are not bad in strength, according to Mo Xiu’s estimation. As long as you are not bad luck, you should be able to go to the third or fourth round.
　　 Hao Ren is okay, now he knows where he is. He is more good at gathering intelligence than fighting.
　　 Dong Fang was a little unacceptable. It was normal to be eliminated in the intramural competition. In the first round of this club competition, he would be eliminated. The girl who was chasing would laugh at him. A very big guy even cried with Moxiu in his arms.
　　 Mo Xiu was also helpless, and could only comfort him: "Okay, if your goddess really likes you, she must be someone who likes you. Do you continue to work hard if your grades are not good? Girls like motivated boys."
　　 Mo Xiu didn't believe these words, but there was no way, let Dong Fang not hold himself first is the key.
　　......
　　 The second day of the individual club heads-up competition, August 16th.
　　 Mo Xiu finally appeared.
　　Because there are ten groups competing at the same time~www.mtlnovel.com~ the job of introducing the players is left to the referee, so it won't be too messy.
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at the referee, not Mu Mu, but a tall boy.
　　The referee said: "Both parties enter the arena, the giant whale club Li Yongjie, the strongest club Mo Xiu!"
　　 Li Yongjie laughed as soon as he played.
　　 "Hahaha, the strongest club? This is the name of the club? It's so funny, so shameless people can take out such a name?"
　　 Mo Xiu said indifferently, "I got the name, what's wrong?"
　　 "You? I'm just a shortcoming, I don't see a person who is forced to be topless. Today I will teach you a lesson."
　　 Mo Xiu asked in surprise: "Don't you know me?"
　　 I want to come to Mo Xiu, not to mention his current fame as the demon king, but only the top eight grades in the school, Li Yongjie shouldn't know himself, let alone everyone is in the first grade, does Li Yongjie practice behind closed doors without asking about the world?
　　 Li Yongjie was stunned for a moment, and then said: "I don't care who you are, who you are, I will blow you up today."
The referee beside 　　 whispered: "Mo Xiu..."
　　 Due to the noisy scene, Li Yongjie did not hear clearly.
　　 "Huh? What did you say?"
　　 Mo Xiu glanced at the referee, and the referee lowered his head a little embarrassedly. This Li Yongjie is simply unbelievable.
　　 The referee coughed slightly to hide his embarrassment.
　　 "Ahem, the game...began!!!"
　　 Li Yongjie seemed to realize that something was wrong, and asked the referee: "What did you just say?"
　　 Mo Xiu was about to come to Li Yongjie at this time.
　　 "He said...My name is Mo Xiu!!!"
　　 "What's wrong with Mo Xiu? What?!!! Mo Xiu!!!"
　　

 
       
 
           


　　 When Li Yongjie reacted, it was too late, and Mo Xiu kicked it out and landed directly outside the field.
　　 The referee looked at the position of Li Yongjie and said: "Mo Xiu wins, advance to the next round, Li Yongjie is eliminated."
　　 Li Yongjie was lying on the sidelines, and the first reaction that came to his mind was to turn around and run away.
　　 Afterwards, when Li Yongjie talked about it to outsiders, he fought bravely and was almost killed by Mo Xiu. The story came to life.
　　 At this point, the name of the Great Demon King Moxiu has been laid, and everyone knows it overnight.
　　 Mo Xiu couldn't laugh or cry when he heard his name. People are all called "Spear God Zhou Qiuwu" and "Variable Goddess Duya".
　　 It’s good to reach Mo Xiu, ‘The Great Demon King Mo Xiu’ is a villain at first hearing, and what’s more, there is a bracket after the devil, (**的魔)!
　　 The day of the game ended, and the first round of the game ended on August 17th and August 18th.
　　 There are still 262 people who have advanced to the second round.
　　 The result of the game was that Mo Xiu and Liu Ziyang advanced and He Lingyue was eliminated.
　　 There are only four people from the strongest club who advanced to the second round, Mo Xiu, Du Ya, Yang Qingzhuo and Liu Ziyang.
　　 After several days of observation, Mo Xiu found that four people had come from the quarterfinals of the school's civil war.
　　 Zhou Qiuwu, Du Ya, and a dark horse Bairuimi, plus himself.
　　 Three of the four are the favorites to win, only Mo Xiu's voice is not loud.
　　 Mo Xiu was originally from the auxiliary department. The gold content of entering the school's top eight in the civil war is the lowest, plus the current character of the big devil, let alone support, not everyone shouting and fighting is good.
　　 On August 19th, the second round of the game began. Mo Xiu did not play. Yang Qingzhuo faced a strong opponent and was defeated due to insufficient attack power. However, the little follower didn't care. Her creed was team supremacy and she didn't care about personal honor.
　　 August 20, the second day of the second round.
　　 Mo Xiu appeared, and the opponent was a member of a small society in the Min Gong department.
　　 Seeing that he met Mo Xiu, he didn't panic and said slowly.
　　 "Mo Xiu, you can advance to the quarterfinals of the school civil war. You do have some strength, but that's all. You are the weakest in the quarterfinals."
　　 Mo Xiu didn't understand that when other people's matches are always on the go, how to meet opponents, they always force a stop first.
　　 "If I am strong or not, won't you know after playing? Come on! Let's get started."
　　 This person has one hand behind his back and the other lightly on his chest, looking like a worldly expert.
　　 "Don't worry, I haven't finished my words yet. I wanted to have a good fight with you, but I couldn't help it, hey!"
　　 "Ah, this man is so handsome. Facing the Great Demon King Mo Xiu, he is so calm and relaxed."
　　 "Yeah, yeah, I saw it too, he looks handsome."
　　 Mo Xiu looked around, there are supporters for such a person.
　　 was waiting impatiently, and was about to launch an attack, only to see the person stepped back and walked out of bounds.
　　 "I won't fight with you today, see you tomorrow!"
　　 After speaking, he swaggered and left.
　　 Mo Xiu covered his head, it was the first time I saw someone admit defeat so fresh and refined.
　　 Even the referee did not react, until the man walked away, he squatted and said: "Uh, Mo Xiu wins, advance to the next round."
　　 Inexplicably promoted like this, Mo Xiu originally thought that there was nothing to see, so let's go home.
　　 But when I walked halfway, I found a venue next to it, and a lot of spectators gathered. After asking, I realized that Zhou Qiuwu and Bai Ruimi had met. In the second round of the qualifiers, there were two favorites to win the championship.
　　 Mo Xiu finally squeezed into the front row, wanting to see the duel between the two.
　　 Bai Rui Mi is a dark horse of the power system. During the school's civil war, he was only promoted after killing a seed of the assault system.
　　 At this time, the battle between the two of them became intense, and it was the first time that Mo Xiu saw that Zhou Qiuwu was not a single move to control the enemy.
　　 Bai Rui Mi and Zhou Qiuwu both have two skills. The battle between the two cheaters is equivalent to the battle between the second grade.
　　 At this time Zhou Qiuwu finally waved the silver spear, but still did not move the position.
　　 Bai Rui Mi's shape is even more stunning, with a pair of white wings more than two meters long behind him, and yellow lasers are ejected from his eyes to attack, waving his wings and hovering in the air, like a **** descending from the earth.
　　 These are two of Bai Rui Mi's skills. One is a powerful laser that Zhou Qiuwu can resist with a long spear, and the other is hard enough to defend against Zhou Qiuwu's long spear's wings.
　　 Neither of them can do anything about it, Mo Xiu is serious in the audience, both of them are too strong.
　　 Although the situation is evenly matched, anyone with a discerning eye knows that Zhou Qiuwu is stronger.
　　 Everyone knows that Zhou Qiuwu has two skills. At first it was a housekeeper trusted by the Zhou family.
　　 It came out from the mouth that after the leak, the Zhou family also severely punished the housekeeper, so there can be no falsehoods. This news has also been passed to Yanjing.
　　 But what is strange is that Zhou Qiuwu has never used the second skill, and has always been fighting with a silver spear.
　　 It seems that Zhou Qiuwu wanted to hide his skills, even in this situation, he didn't want to reveal it easily.
　　 The organizer is also very helpless. The two people met so early. If one of them is eliminated, they will lose a lot of highlights.
　　 In the end, the organizers declared a tie when the two were deadlocked.
　　 As soon as the result came out, not only was the audience confused, but Zhou Qiuwu and Bai Ruimi were also very upset and forced a draw.
　　 Mo Xiu frowned slightly. The organizer has no principles. There has never been a rule in the rules that says that the game can be judged as a tie.
　　 Even if the two were evenly matched before, they would wait until the end, one of them was exhausted, and the one who fell first would be the loser.
　　 Originally wanted to keep the organizer who was watching ~www.mtlnovel.com~ This time it was self-defeating. The audience said that the organizer had shady scenes, and deliberately arranged for the two to meet in advance, and then judged a tie to deceive the audience.
　　 Even if the organizer returns all the money bet in this game after the game, it will not be able to restore the stinking reputation.
　　 The second round of the qualifiers ended in this farce.
　　 The three strongest clubs were promoted to three people, Mo Xiu, Liu Ziyang, and Du Ya.
　　 On August 20, the third round of the qualifiers, a total of 132 people remained.
　　The remaining number of people can finally end a round in one day.
　　 Mo Xiu's opponent is a girl, a little girl who can only promise.
　　 Seeing this little girl reminded Mo Xiu of Ye Qian'er who was in the third year of high school.
　　 After the little girl came on the field, she found that it was Mo Xiu who was fighting, and she said with some frustration: "Big Devil, I can't beat you."
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Then do you want to admit defeat?"
　　 "No! Even if I can't beat you, I have to try it. It's already this round."
　　 "Then it starts?"
　　 "May I ask you a few questions?"
　　 Mo Xiu took a deep breath, what's wrong? No matter who you are playing against, why don't you have to fight once?
  "Just ask!"
　　 The little girl blushed and lowered her head and said: "Yang Qingzhuo is really your maid?"
　　 "No!"
　　 The little girl jumped up in excitement, then looked at Mo Xiu, and began to tweak again.
　　 "I know, I bet with my friend that you are not a bad guy, Yang Qingzhuo has been following you all the time, Liu Ziyang calls you the boss, you are obviously a standard domineering president."
　　 Mo Xiu is one of the first two big, his own name is enough, don't add any more, can't hold it...

　　 Mo Xiu said, "You still think of me as the devil?"
　　 "Why?"
 "let's start!"
　　 The little girl sees Mo Xiu preparing for battle, she is not welcome, she directly activates her skill, which is an assassin skill.
　　 The little girl disappeared after activating the skill, but it didn't disappear completely.
　　 is to reduce the sense of existence through skills, so that people can't feel her existence.
　　 After Moxiu activates the skill, he can see it after he concentrates on it.
　　 Once the little girl's skills lost its effect, things became simpler, and Mo Xiu directly punched her out of bounds.
　　 The referee announced the result, "Mo Xiu wins!"
　　 After Mo Xiu won, he turned his head and left without even looking at the little girl.
　　The little girl excitedly shouted behind her back: "Sure enough, she is an overbearing president."
　　The game is over, and the remaining three of the strongest clubs all advance to the fourth round.
　　 Mo Xiu returned home, and when he entered the door, he saw that it was not hot pot.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo didn't know why, he started cooking.
　　 Mo Xiu wanted to laugh when Yang Qingzhuo looked like he was busy after he was busy.
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "Why do you think of cooking?"
　　 Zheng Yi said in a low voice, "Of course I have enough hot pot. No matter how delicious the hot pot is, I can't stand it like this!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo, as if he hadn’t heard Zheng Yi’s words, blushed and said, “I read in the book that the hostess must know how to cook. I have been studying for several days. I’ve been cooking for the first time today. Try it.”
　　 Zheng Yi immediately jumped up, and secretly gave Mo Xiubi a thumbs up.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't even dare to answer when he heard this, so he could only pick up a piece of dish that he didn't know what it was and put it in his mouth.
　　 Chew it carefully, the taste is really good, I didn’t expect it to be unprofitable, there are really two things.
　　 Zheng Yi was full of praise after tasting it.
　　 "Yang Qingzhuo, your craftsmanship is so good, you have transformed from a **** of food to a **** of food."
　　 And Xiao Fushun on the side is eating with relish, and no one cares about it.
　　 When Xiao Fushun turned his back to Mo Xiu, the pattern on his back flickered, and Mo Xiu fell into it unconsciously.
　　 Slowly, the patterns in Mo Xiu's eyes began to rotate, twisting together, forming a whirlpool faster and faster, the whirlpool slowly slowed down, and finally stopped and the picture stretched.
　　 Mo Xiu was not seeing the dining table or the pattern behind Xiao Fushun, but a battlefield.
　　 There is not a single plant on the battlefield, the huge beast is as high as a dozen stories, and the skills released by humans are flying all over the sky.
　　 There was a giant who was fighting with the giant beast. The blood and screams made Mo Xiu shudder.
　　 When Mo Xiu was in a trance, he heard a sound in his ear and couldn't understand what it was. He tried to listen, and listened hard.
　　 "Moxiu...Moxiu!"
　　 The picture in front of him changed, and he returned to the dining table. Xiao Fushun had finished eating and lay down on the chair and fell asleep.
　　 Zheng Yi asked suspiciously: "Mo Xiu, what's the matter with you? Why are you in a daze suddenly, so you won't listen to me."
　　 Mo Xiu took Xiao Fushun to the table, and the little guy was unsatisfied when he was awakened and kicked Mo Xiu a few times.
　　 "Look at the pattern on Xiao Fushun's back, do you see anything?"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo looked at it for a while and said, "There is nothing, this pattern is quite strange."
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Zheng Yi, expecting what Zheng Yi could see.
　　 But Zheng Yi blinked his eyes and said, "I said Mo Xiu, you have nothing wrong, right? My eyes are going to be blind, and I can't see anything? What did you just see?"
　　 "A battlefield, a very strange battlefield, I feel like I am in it."
　　 Zheng Yi knows Mo Xiu, and he won't be joking at this time.
　　 took a closer look and said, "I still haven't seen anything, but according to your statement, you seem to have fallen into illusion."
　　 "Illusion?"
Zheng Yi nodded and said: "Yes, I heard my dad say that some people's skills are illusions, and let others see some weird things. Xiao Fushun is a beast. Will his talent skills be illusions? Did you accidentally use it on you just now?"
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Xiao Fushun and said, "Is that right?"
　　 Xiao Fushun was a little dazed at this time, looking at these people back and forth, it seemed that they couldn't understand what they were saying.
　　 Mo Xiu stared at Xiao Fushun's back for a while, but did not enter the strange state just now.
　　 From now on, Zheng Yi’s analysis is most likely.
　　 But Mo Xiu was still thinking about the scene he saw just now. He always felt as if he had seen it somewhere, but he couldn't remember it.
　　 I couldn't figure it out and still made my head hurt. Mo Xiu shook his head, hey! forget about it.
　　 Back to the room, Mo Xiu lay on the bed, remembering that he hadn't contacted Mu Qingyi for a long time, and made a phone call quickly.
　　 "Hello? Do you still know to call me?"
　　 Mo Xiu asked softly: "What's wrong with me?"
　　 "Didn't you last time that you had nothing to do with the girl named Yang Qingzhuo? Why did you live together?"
　　 Mu Qingyi knows again? Mo Xiu now suspects that Mu Qingyi has a camera installed on him. Why does he know everything?
　　 "Are you jealous?"
　　 "You don't come to this one. You fooled it the last time."
　　 "We have nothing, Zheng Yi also lives with me, you can ask him if you don't believe me."
　　 "I don't ask, it has nothing to do with me, huh!"
　　 "Qingyi!"
 "Ok?"
　　 "How are you doing recently?"
　　 "Also...not bad!"
　　 "You haven't had a good time, are you? Tell me about it!"
　　 "Well...Okay, I have something to do, hang up first, and talk some other day!"
 "Ok!"
　　 "Hey! Mo Xiu!"
 "what's happenin?"
　　 "Miss you, bye!"
 "I......"
　　 "Deep toot..."
 "miss you too!"
　　 Before Mo Xiu finished speaking, the phone was already hung up over there.
　　 Ming knew that Mu Qingyi had a bad time, UU reading www.uukanshu.com was helpless at this time, hey! I am still not strong enough! !
　　......
　　 On August 21, the fourth round of the preliminaries, there are still 64 contestants.
　　 Mo Xiu's opponent in the fourth round was a boy named Mi Luo, Chen Xi from the six major societies.
　　 It's the fourth round, and no one who is promoted will be weak. Mo Xiu did not take it lightly to release God's spy.

　　 Skill effect: Summon two energy body tigers, all attributes of the tigers are 120% of the releaser.
　　 Second form: Two tigers are combined into one, and the attributes become 200% of the releaser.
　　 Duration: Ten minutes
　　Cooling time: two hours"
　　 Summoning skills Mo Xiu encountered for the first time, should it belong to the power system? The attribute is one hundred and two percent of the releaser can still be dealt with.
　　 The host announced the start of the game, and Milo immediately released his skills and summoned two tigers.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't release the skills at the beginning, and felt that he could deal with these two tigers without using the skills.
　　 But when I really fight, I realize that it’s not the case. Although the attributes of tigers are not particularly strong, their flexibility is not comparable to that of human beings.
　　 Without using skills, Mo Xiu found it very difficult to deal with these two tigers.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't dare to drag it, and immediately activated the descent of the Valkyrie, a golden light flashed under his feet, and he immediately became more comfortable.
However, the fight between the two tigers is still a bit annoying. Milo is also a decisive person. Seeing that the two tigers pose no threat to Moxiu, he immediately activates the second form, combining the two tigers into one and turning into one more. Big tiger.
　　 Mo Xiu smiled slightly and said in his heart, ‘I’m just waiting for you. ’

　　 When there are two tigers, you can still fight with Mo Xiu. After forming a tiger, although the fighting power soars, it can no longer stop Mo Xiu's path.
　　 Mo Xiu ignored the tiger at all, and went straight to Miro. The weakness of the summoning skills was the main body.
　　 Mo Xiu approached Miro in an instant, and Miro had no choice but to fight.
　　 But where Miro was Mo Xiu's opponent, he was defeated by a few moves.
　　Miluo is also a tough guy, and he didn't give up, gritted his teeth and insisted on taking a few punches from Mo Xiu, wanting to wait until the tiger came.
　　 But Mo Xiu didn't give him a chance after all. A hand knife stunned him, and the tiger behind him disappeared.
　　 The referee announced the result.
　　 "Mo Xiusheng, advance to the top 32."
　　 Mo Xiu gave a sigh of relief, the top thirty-two, only the last game left to advance to the top sixteen.
　　 The club battle is different from the school war. The top 16 is selected instead of the top 8.
After 　　, Mo Xiu watched the match between Du Ya and Liu Ziyang, and the two actually met together.
　　 Liu Ziyang felt very unlucky. He met a seeded player in the school civil war, and this time he met Du Ya.
　　 However, Liu Ziyang has made great progress during this period, and the afterimages of the two skills cannot be underestimated, forcing Du Ya's full strength.
　　 Mo Xiu probably counted. Du Ya switched her armor form eleven times in this game, which is enough to prove how much trouble Liu Ziyang caused Du Ya.
　　 When the game was divided, Du Ya deliberately kicked Liu Ziyang's stomach twice.
　　 left a sentence, "Why don't you admit defeat? I'm exhausted!"
　　 August 22, the final round of the qualifiers.
　　 Mo Xiu met an old acquaintance, He Xu who was furious with the tornado.
　　 He Xu secretly said unlucky, and ran into Mo Xiu again.
　　 Mo Xiu was not in a hurry this time. Seeing He Xu wanted to surrender, he quickly said: "Don't concede first, let's talk."
　　 He Xu shook his head and said: "I have nothing to talk about with you!"
　　 "No, are you interested in joining my club? The treatment is very good, and there is no need to select for the qualifications."
　　 "No, my current club is very good!"
　　 "Come on, I'll pay you, but other clubs don't have a salary."
　　 Mo Xiu values ​​He Xu's skills very much, which is equivalent to a large-scale group control skill.
　　 But no matter what Mo Xiu said, He Xu remained indifferent.
　　 He Xu turned around and walked out of the venue, Mo Xiu also followed out, chasing He Xu and continued.
　　 I was stunned to see the referees. This is too natural, right? Digging people on the spot?
　　 The referee scratched his head and said: "Hey? Who won? He Xu walked first, right? Ahem! Mo Xiu wins and advances to the top 16!"
　　 Mo Xiu kept chasing to the entrance of the stadium, seeing He Xu still unmoved, so he could only give up.
　　 After returning to the stadium to watch the game, Du Ya also successfully advanced.
　　 In the top sixteen, the Qinglong Society was promoted to two, the White Tiger Society was promoted to three, the Suzaku Society was promoted to three, the Xuanwu Society was promoted to two, the Yanjing Society was promoted to two, and the Chenxi Society was promoted to two.
　　 The six major societies enrolled 14 people. What is different from the past is that one society has sprung up side by side with the six major societies, at least in the first grade group.
　　 That was the strongest club that was reduced to a laughing stock at the beginning. No one thought that a small club with only seven people would have two people able to advance to the top sixteen, and the two of them also entered the quarter-finals of the school's civil war at the same time.
　　 Everyone started to face up to the strongest society, including the six major societies.
　　 When the strongest society has strength, the name is no longer a joke, but a resounding sign!
　　 Even the organizers took the initiative to find Mo Xiu to seek cooperation with the strongest society. Of course, Mo Xiu didn't have so much time, so he pushed him to the vice chairman Hao Ren.
　　 Hao Ren is now helping the strongest community to collect information and organize information full-time. All community affairs are in charge of Hao Ren. Compared with Mo Xiu, Hao Rencai is more like the president of the strongest community.
　　 The results of the heads-up competition have greatly strengthened the confidence of the seven members of the club. Du Ya has now fully believed that the strongest club has the power to fight in the team battle.
　　 On August 23, under the leadership of Mo Xiu, the strongest society continued to carry out the task of extermination.
　　 Everyone in the club is full of confidence, and all these changes in their hearts are miraculous.
　　 At the beginning of the establishment of the club, everyone was forced by Mo Xiu, and then when I signed up later, I felt that this was actually not bad, at least it saved the time for selection in the club.
　　 Now, everyone is full of confidence in this team, and I am very fortunate to be able to join such a club.
　　 On August 26, the remaining eight C-level missions were all completed, and the next step was the B-level mission.
　　 Before proceeding to the B-level mission, everyone did a lot of preparation work in order to be foolproof.
　　 As you need to return to the department on August 29th, prepare for the team battle in the school.
　　 So there is only one day to perform the task.
　　 August 28th, march!
　　 annihilation target: Montenegro group of four.
　　 There are only four people in this small organization, but each of them is very strong and has a reputation in that area.
　　 Before departure, in the activity room.
　　 Only Mo Xiu and Hao Ren were left to do some final pre-war preparations.
　　 Hao Ren looked at the phone in a daze, as if seeing something horrified.
　　 Mo Xiu asked, "Hao Ren, what's the matter? Are you scared?"
　　 Hao Ren handed the phone to Mo Xiu. After receiving the phone, the smile on Mo Xiu's face disappeared instantly, with a very serious expression.
　　 Shot! ! !
　　 appeared in Yenching University!
　　 The picture shows a girl lying on the ground with a blood hole in the back of her head. It looks like she was killed by a sneak attack.
　　The situation is developing too fast, and it is getting more and more serious. Mo Xiu understands that the issue of thermal weapons should have alarmed the top leaders of all parties.
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "When did it happen? I want detailed information about it."
　　 "Last night, the news was blocked~www.mtlnovel.com~ but there are still photos coming out, I will check!"
　　 Then Liu Ziyang came in and said: "Boss! Why haven't you set off yet?"
　　 "Tell everyone, today's task is cancelled, let's take a day off, and wait for the school team battle to be over before going to destroy the four-person team."
　　 Mo Xiu is not such a turbulent person, there must be something important, and Liu Ziyang did.
　　 Others left, Yang Qingzhuo returned to the activity room and waited for Mo Xiu.
　　 Hao Ren is in contact, and Mo Xiu is waiting anxiously.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo also looked around, not knowing what was going on at this time.
　　 Hao Ren suddenly raised his head and said: "Yes!"
　　 Mo Xiu patted the table and said, "Say it!"
　　 "It happened at the entrance of the school, so even if the news was blocked in time, many people saw it."
　　 "At the school gate? That means the murderer was seen?"
　　 Hao Ren flipped through his phone again and said, "That's right! The time of the crime was early in the morning, and there were not many people at that time. The murderer was arrested this morning and was not a student at Yenching University."
　　 "Is there any information about this girl?"
　　 "Sophomores in the Elementary Department, there is nothing special about it, so there is not much information that can be found."
　　 This case and the Qingyun University case have nothing in common. Why is it all right?
　　 "What's next?"
　　 "I can't find it, the rest is classified."
　　 Mo Xiu frowned and asked, "Then do you know who caught the murderer? Where is the murderer now?"
　　 "I only know that I was arrested by the school, but now I don't know where the person is."
  school? Cao Fenglin must know.
　　 Mo Xiu rushed out immediately.
　　 "You are waiting for me here!"
　　

    
   


　　 Mo Xiu rushed to Cao Fenglin's office.
　　 As soon as he entered the door, Cao Fenglin motioned to Mo Xiu to sit down first.
　　 "I know where you came from!"
　　 Mo Xiu said, "What happened this time?"
　　 Cao Fenglin's attitude has changed a lot from last time, and he patiently explained to Mo Xiu.
　　 "The situation at the crime scene was like this. The murderer and the victim had an argument at the school gate. After the argument, the victim turned and walked into the school. The murderer shot in the back."
　　 "The cause and effect is that the two have emotional entanglements. This is the same as the Qingyun University case."
　　 Mo Xiu asked: "I want to know the source of the gun!"
　　 "The murderer is a rich boy, he can buy it at a party again."
　　 "The gun seller?"
　　 "The organization selling guns was destroyed overnight. All of them claimed that the gun fell from the sky."
　　 Mo Xiu frowned, what is going on?
　　 "Teacher Cao, are you still reluctant to investigate with me? The situation is very serious now, at least tell me what you know!"
　　 Cao Fenglin obviously hesitated, but still refused: "Sorry, I can't help you!"
　　 "Aren't you afraid of your relatives and friends in danger?"
　　 "I said, I can't help you, I advise you not to participate in this matter."
　　 "Teacher!!!"
　　 "Okay!! I didn't let you intervene before, because you and I were not at a level enough to touch the truth, and now I won't let you intervene because we no longer need to intervene."
　　 Cao Fenglin threw a map to Mo Xiu, and Mo Xiu took it and saw a dozen circles painted on it.
　　 "Is this a map of Yanjing?"
　　 Cao Fenglin closed his eyes and said, “Yes, this is the map of Yanjing. All the circles where the circles are drawn have been murdered by heat weapons.”
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Cao Fenglin incredulously, but he didn't expect things to have developed to this point.
"Do you know the reason? Counting the one that happened yesterday in the Yenching University, there were a total of 18 homicides. You don’t know, it’s because the news was blocked. Now it’s not just the Yenching University school, law enforcement team, and military. , Shadow level 6 and above teams are dispatched to investigate this matter, you... your energy is too small!"
　　 Mo Xiu fell into deep thought. He didn't expect that a clue he had discovered would develop to this point within a month.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't want to give up, even if there are more people to investigate, he must do his best.
　　 "Teacher, do you know the current investigation progress?"
　　 Cao Fenglin hated that iron could not be made of steel, and said: "You, why don't you listen to persuasion? It is now certain that all thermal weapons fell from the sky. As for who threw them, it is unknown."
　　 All the clues stayed at this step, Mo Xiu stood up and said goodbye to Cao Fenglin, ready to leave.
　　Mo Xiu doesn't blame Cao Fenglin for not helping, it can be seen that he is also working hard to collect clues.
 "and many more!"
　　 Mo Xiu turned around and asked, "What's the matter? Teacher Cao!"
　　 Cao Fenglin sighed and said, "Hey! I can't help you with anything else, but I can tell you my experience."
　　 "Respectfully listen!"
　　 "Why has the advent of thermal weapons increased the crime rate?"
　　 Mo Xiu thought without a second thought: "Because thermal weapons are powerful and easy to use."
　　 "You are talking about the superficial reason, but the fundamental reason is the animality and desire of human beings!"
　　 Mo Xiu did not speak, but listened carefully.
"There may be many people with hot weapons, but there are only two kinds of people who really commit crimes. One is the small and wealthy, who have things they can't get. They want to use violence to solve them directly. This represents the two shooting incidents on campus. The other is the low-level people, represented by the circles on the blocks on the map."
　　 "Little rich people have more desires than animality and fear rules, so they often commit crimes premeditated."
　　 "The people at the bottom, who have been suppressed for a long time, suddenly broke out. The animality is greater than the desire. They are often out of control and hurt the innocent!"
　　 Mo Xiu said: "What is desire? What is animality?"
　　 "There is something that allows you to do things you couldn't do before, but this thing violates the rules, and you still accept this thing. This is what I said before."
　　 "There is a thing that can make you break out completely. You don't have to swallow, you can do whatever you want. The consequence is self-destruction. You still accept this thing. This is what I said before."
　　 Mo Xiu asked as if he did not understand, "Then how do we do it?"
　　 Cao Fenglin said: "Desire and animality will only hide, and will not disappear. They can only be locked together, which is a total prohibition of thermal weapons, but now this lock... has been opened."
　　 "Then you should find out the black hand behind the scenes and lock it again!"
　　 "Mo Xiu, you are smart, smarter than me, but what you lack now is the pattern, the pattern is too small..."
 "How to say?"
"Let’s not say that there is no clue now, and there is no way to find the behind-the-scenes, that is, the root cause cannot be eliminated. Let’s just talk about the current situation. I don’t know how many people in the entire alliance hide thermal weapons. Can this hidden danger be locked in ?"
　　Mo Xiu was silent, yes, the situation has reached the point it is now, and it will be very difficult to control it again.
　　 "The last time a total ban on thermal weapons took ten years, and the background at that time was that the wild beasts looked forward to it, and the whole people were united in one mind. It is not the same."
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Teacher Cao, do you think this hot weapon was thrown by a beast? Want to disintegrate us from the inside?"
"There is a possibility, but it is unlikely. I prefer humans to do it. Most of the places where this person puts thermal weapons are in slum areas, or at banquets of wealthy businessmen, so that thermal weapons can be digested quickly and they will not be passed on to law enforcement teams There~www.mtlnovel.com~ this person understands people's hearts better than you and me..."
　　 Mo Xiu walked out of the office, his head dizzy.
　　 pattern? Is it human? It seems that I still think too simple.
　　 Mo Xiu took out his phone while walking, opened the Shadow Software, and found that the hot weapon investigation task created before was gone.
　　 I took a look at the homepage again, and then I realized that the matter was a big deal, and there was a top task on the shadow homepage.
　　"Investigation mission: the source of thermal weapons (unlimited number of times, multiple people and teams can accept the mission.)
　　 Task level: SSS
　　Mission details: Recently, within the alliance, several cities have been injured by thermal weapons. For specific details, please check the relevant forums on the homepage.
　　Completion condition: find out the source of dispersing thermal weapons
　　Task reward: 100 billion points"
　　 Shadow also released a mission, which shows that the Alliance attaches great importance to this matter.
　　 Mo Xiu opened the forum to check. Now in the entire alliance, there are forty-three cities where thermal weapons wounded people, among which Yanjing was the most serious.
　　 Mo Xiu looked for it. Shuncheng was among the forty-three cities, but it was not serious, there was only one case.
　　 Still not at ease, Mo Xiu called his mother Li Yuan to ask about the situation.
　　 After receiving the news that his mother was safe and sound, he called Yue Yuan again and asked him to send some people to protect his mother during this period, so that he was relieved.
　　 On August 29, August 30, and August 31, the first and second teams of the Auxiliary Department conducted intensive training to prepare for the team battle in the school.
　　 During this period of time, Mumu has improved again. Whether it is the analysis of the battle situation or the understanding of the skills, it has improved to a level, which has benefited everyone a lot.
　　 Mu Mu just said lightly: "We make progress together!"
　　

 
       
 
           


　　 On September 1st, the much-anticipated intramural team competition started. Compared with the individual competitions, the team competitions are more enjoyable.
　　The participating teams are four teams from the Force Attack Department and the Element Department, three teams from the Agile Attack Department and the Ability Department, and two teams from the Auxiliary Department. There are 16 teams in total. The top four are selected in the preliminaries.
　　 The competition process is just the opposite of the individual competition. In order to ensure fairness, the preliminaries are eliminated. After the top four are selected, the four teams will play against each other in turn, and the team with the most points wins the championship.
　　The rule is that each department has a group of seeded teams, and the seeded teams do not meet.
　　 But because there are a total of five departments, if you want to select the top four, there will be a seeded team that must be eliminated. Therefore, the school stipulates that the two teams that ranked last in the previous year will meet.
　　 This kind of game mechanism is equivalent to a seeded team, and it is rare that the second team of other departments will be upset and promoted.
　　 And this mechanism makes it difficult for the last player to turn over, especially in the auxiliary department.
　　 The last place this year, next year's preliminaries will encounter other seeded teams, the combat effectiveness of the auxiliary system is already weak, and it is almost impossible to advance. This is a vicious circle.
　　 Therefore, since there were intramural competitions, the auxiliary department has never made it to the finals, and has always stopped in the semi-finals.
　　 After hearing the rules, everyone in the auxiliary department was a little disappointed. It was okay to play against other departments, but this time it was against the ability department!
　　 Talents of the ability department are coming out in large numbers this year, and there are only three people entering the quarter-finals in the individual heads-up. According to outsiders, the probability of winning the ability department has surpassed that of the auxiliary department, ranking first.
　　 Mo Xiu also felt a lot of pressure, and couldn't help looking at Xiao Lan.
　　 Xiao Lan is definitely the key to the game. As long as Xiao Lan shows up his fighting spirit and exerts his full strength, Mo Xiu believes that he is on par.
　　 "Everyone, the team competition has begun! The team competition not only reflects individual strength, but more importantly, the team's tenacity, the tacit understanding between the players, and everyone's contribution is very important."
　　 "Let us invite all participating teams to enter..."
　　 Following the introduction of the host, all sixteen teams entered the venue, followed by a list of matches.
　　 In addition to fixing the seed teams of the auxiliary system and the ability system in one division, the other teams are completely random.
　　 The luck of the auxiliary system is not bad, and he met the fourth team of the storming system, but the next round will be against the seeded team of the ability system.
　　 The game field is a four-in-one field in the middle, and there is only this one field.
　　 Since there is only one set of duels each time, the first round of sixteen and eight is divided into two days.
　　 Mo Xiu’s auxiliary seed team was the last to play, and the two days also gave everyone time to observe their opponents.
　　 The main opponents are of course the other four seeded teams. Looking at the whole round, each team has its own characteristics.
　　 Mumu is taking notes quickly, wanting to record every detail.
　　 Especially when it came to the seeded team of the ability department, Mu Mu even wrote down the small actions of each player.
　　Strike system, there is nothing to say, the single body is very strong, there is no tactics at all in the battle, directly rushed up, after two rounds of rushing, the opponent disarmed.
　　 agile attacking system, this is the best team, which perfectly integrates the advantages of speed and flexibility into the tactics. The small cooperation between the two and the combined moves between the five are all very smooth.
The 　　 elemental element is a rogue element. Du Ya stands at the top and uses the armor of earth to act as a shield for everyone behind.
　　 The four people behind each throw a skill, and the game is over! There is no reason to talk to them, just rely on the elemental skills that damage and explode to defeat you.
　　The last is the ability system. The opponent is the second team of the agile attack system, which is the top two in the second team. Mu Mu and Mo Xiu originally thought this game was of great reference.
　　 Unexpectedly, the first team of the ability department made an amazing move, leaving the audience stunned.
　　 The game has just started, and two players jumped directly out of the field, which is equivalent to letting the other two people out, and the field is a three-on-five situation.
　　 Where is self-confidence? It's arrogant.
　　 Of course, the audience did not think it was a big deal. They shouted frantically. All the five members of the second team of the agile attack department gritted their teeth and did not want to suffer such humiliation.
　　 One of the team members said: "Captain, they...this is humiliating us!"
The captain was very calm at this time and said: "No! They just don't want the auxiliary team to see the true strength, but well... the snipe and the clam are fighting for the fisherman's profit. It is also our opportunity. Just seize this opportunity. , Maybe you can enter the semifinals!"
　　 The three ability players on the opposite side were unmoved, did not show disdain, and there was no arrogance. They were always calm.
　　 Mo Xiu knows that the power system is terrible, and every player is well-trained.
  "Game start!"
　　 The game ended in just five minutes. The power system won. This result was not unexpected, but the process was too horrible. Three people slammed five people, and the player with two skills has not shot yet. This is simply too horrible...
　　 At this time, a member of the second team of the agile attack system who fell on the field said to the captain: "Captain! Didn't you say this is our chance?"
　　 The captain curled his lips and said: "You still said you can't be humiliated? Why did you fall to the ground for the first time just now?"
　　 Bai Ruimi, who had been on par with Zhou Qiuwu before, took the initiative to abstain. At this moment, seeing the victory or defeat on the field, he immediately looked at the auxiliary system and looked at each other with Mo Xiu.
　　 He didn't avoid others in this look, and the provocation was obvious.
　　 Dong Fang sat on the sidelines, but exasperated, shouted: "What are you looking at?!! You are not convinced?"
　　 Mo Xiu hurriedly covered his face. This Dong Fang has never disappointed people before, how embarrassed he really came.
　　 Bai Ruimi smiled evilly and shouted to this side: "I really don't accept it. We will compete in the next game. The auxiliary department is not strong, but we are very domineering."
　　 I don’t know if this is a response to Dong Fang~www.mtlnovel.com~ or a satire of Mo Xiu, but there is no time to continue to care about it at this time, because the auxiliary team is about to play.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at today's opponents, the fourth team of the attacking department, even if the attacking department is full of talents, the fourth team will not be particularly strong.
　　 Simply launch God's spy on Barry Mi and the person next to him. There is no room for loss in the next game. If you spy again, you can only know the skills of the two.
　　 After spying many times, Mo Xiu could know all the skills of the other five.
　　 First of all, Barry Mi’s skills.
　　"One skill: Burst Laser 2
　　 Skill effect: The eyes shoot out light with a burning effect.
　　 Duration: Ten minutes
　　 Cooling time: two hours
　　 Two skills: Guardian Silver Wing 2
　　 Skill effect: Two wings emerge from the back. The defense power of the silver wing is 800% of its own. It can be controlled freely and has the ability to fly.
　　 Duration: fifteen minutes
　　Cooling time: three hours"
　　Bairui Mi’s two skill lists are not considered the top level, but the two skills work together, it is simply excellent offensive and defensive, as can be seen from the last time he played with Zhou Qiuwu.
　　 Next is the second person, another dark horse that has been very low-key.
　　"One Skill: Life Connection 2
　　 Skill effect: Choose two targets for life connection. When one target is damaged, the other target will take 50% of the damage.
　　 Duration: Five minutes
　　 Cooling time: one hour
　　 Two skills: deceitful words to confuse the crowd
　　 Skill effect: Issue a command to interfere with the actions of up to five targets.
　　Cooling time: three hours"
　　 Mo Xiu narrowed his eyes, this...something troublesome!
　　
    
   


　　 In the last game of this round, the first team of the auxiliary department played against the fourth team of the attacking department.
　　 Mo Xiu, Xiao Lan, He Lingyue, Yang Qingzhuo and Hu Xianming are ready to play as the starters.
　　 was stopped by Mu Mu just as he was about to play.
　　 Mumu gathered everyone together and said, "We'd better save some strength, and don't let the other side see our strongest strength."
　　 Mo Xiu replied as the captain: "Okay, you arrange it."
　　 "Today's lineup is Mo Xiu, Xiao Lan, Dong Fang, Xue Linger and Jia Haiyang."
　　 Mumu replaced He Lingyue, Yang Qingzhuo and Hu Xianming, and all three substitutes played.
　　 Without waiting for a few people to ask questions, Mu Mu explained: "I took two points into consideration in this arrangement. One is not to underestimate the enemy and keep Mo Xiu Xiaolan on the court to ensure that there are no accidents in the game."
　　 "The other thing is, you have also seen that the person with the ability tie is very powerful, I am ashamed, this person must have collected a lot of information about Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan, there is no need to hide it anymore."
　　 Mumu not only won the trust of Cao Fenglin, but also the support of the head of the auxiliary department. This time she was solely responsible for leading the team.
　　 Such an opportunity brought Mu Mu's rights and pressure at the same time.
　　The powers of the power system did all their best in this competition, which made Mumu feel very stressed.
　　 The host has introduced the two teams at this time, and the two teams are starting to appear.
　　 Until the stage, Mo Xiu and the others did not discuss the tactics. When they arrived on the court, Dong Fang asked: "Mo Xiu, how do we fight later?"
　　 Mo Xiu looked back at the players and said, "There is no tactics, just play directly."
　　 The host shouted: "The game begins!"
　　 The assault system began to deploy, and Mo Xiu waved his hand and said, "Go!"
　　 All the five members of the auxiliary department released their skills, and they rushed up.
　　 The five strong offensive team immediately put up a defensive formation when they saw it, and confronted the enemy.
　　 There was a lot of discussion in the audience.
　　 "I'm going, am I wrong? The auxiliary system initiates an offense? The assault system is forced to defend?"
　　 "Yes, is this the reverse?"
"You know what a fart, and the auxiliary department is different. Xiao Lan is the younger sister of Xiao Hong's senior sister. She is very strong. There is also that big demon. Regardless of the poor people, the strength is still good. The school will challenge the top eight. Just challenge the top sixteen, this is the proof."
　　 There was a lot of discussion off the field, and the situation on the field returned. The formation of the strong offensive system was instantly dissipated by the two strong offensive points of Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan.
　　 In less than ten minutes, there is only one person left in the field of the storm attack system.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at this person and said, "Is it me throwing you out, or are you going out by yourself?"
　　 This person said, "I would not give up easily, I will come if I want to."
　　The four teammates who were eliminated from the field said.
　　 "Oh shit! Don't pretend it soon."
　　 "Come down!"
　　 "There is no hope, do you want one dozen five?"
　　 "No chance!"
　　 The man on the field shouted to the audience: "You guys who have no seeds, you actually affect morale."
　　 Dong Fang didn't want to listen to their ink marks, and kicked this man out of the field.
 "Go to hell!"
　　 The host announced the result and said: "The first team of the auxiliary department won the promotion! The next round of competition time is August 4th."
　　 The two-day game is over, and the next day is a day off. On August 4th, the team will be playing against the ability team.
　　 After the time of the game and the host’s explanation, God’s Spy has cooled down and can be used again.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at the power department, released the skills, and read the skills of the two members.
　　"One skill: draw a dungeon as a prison 3
　　 Skill effect: Draw a circle on the ground with your feet, and all the targets in the circle cannot go out of the circle. (The maximum circle is ten meters in diameter)
　　 Duration: one minute
　　 Cooling time: 20 minutes"
　　"One skill: Petrochemical 3
　　 Skill effect: Choose a target and petrify it. The petrified defense power is increased by 500%, and the speed becomes zero.
　　 Duration: Three seconds
　　Cooling time: three minutes"
　　 These two people are control skills, which makes the tactics of the power system have great variability.
　　 However, according to the current situation, it is basically certain that Bai Ruixing is the main attack point.
　　 Bai Ruixing saw that Mo Xiu was looking here, stretched out the thumb of his right hand, first upwards, then slowly turned downwards.
　　 Such a provocation, Mo Xiu was still not angry, and responded with a smile.
　　 August 3, this day is a rest, Mu Mu didn't want to waste this precious day, and gathered the first and second teams of the auxiliary department for special training before the game.
　　 Of course, the second team of the auxiliary department has been eliminated, this time mainly as a sparring team.
　　 Mumu arranged the detailed tactics and required each team member to execute in accordance with the established plan.
　　 But the effect after a round is not very satisfactory. Everyone has their own habits, and there are always unexpected situations. It is difficult to follow Mu's tactics without fail.
　　 Mumu fell into deep thought, and now in this situation, he can only practice running-in continuously, but time is running out, and the game will be held tomorrow.
　　 Just when Mu Mu was distressed, Mo Xiu sat beside Mu Mu.
　　 Mu Mu saw that it was Mo Xiu, and forced a smile and said, "Mo Xiu, you can take a break first. I think what should I do?"
　　 Mo Xiu said, "Did you know? You put too much pressure on yourself."
　　 Mumu sighed and said: "There is no way, the auxiliary department has given me such a great power and trust. I can't let them down."
　　 "Then you oppress us?"
　　 Mu turned his head to the side and asked suspiciously: "I didn't oppress you, I was oppressing myself."
　　 "Do you think I'm good?"
　　 Mumu didn't understand why Mo Xiu asked, but still replied, "Of course it's amazing!"
　　 "Then where do you think I am so good?"
　　 "Your skills~www.mtlnovel.com~Your physical fitness, your on-the-spot response... You mean!!!"
　　 "Yes, why do you want us to follow your fixed tactics? Do you not trust me or everyone?"
　　 Mu Mu lowered his head and said: "Neither, I just think this tactic is the best, the most promising to defeat the power system."
Mo Xiu shook his head and said: "We have been training together for so long, and we have a tacit understanding. Don't you believe our performance on the court? If the opponent is not using the tactics you predicted, will our tactics be useless? Then it will only be in a hurry."
　　 "What you said makes sense, I do have a problem, so let me design two more tactics."
　　 Mo Xiu said helplessly: "I didn't mean that..."
　　 I don't know when, Cao Fenglin came in and walked to Mu Mu's side.
　　 patted Mu's shoulder lightly and said, "You take a break first, and leave the rest to me."
　　 Mu Mu said unwillingly: "However, I still have a lot of things that I haven't talked about. The opponent's attack line is a problem that we should avoid."
　　 Cao Fenglin still said softly: "I said, let me come, you are too tired."
　　 Mumu still wanted to say something, but in the end he didn't say it, knowing that his current state of mind was very bad and a little impatient.
　　 Cao Fenglin asked Mu Mu to sit aside and personally direct the training.
　　 "Listen well, everyone. The second team is disbanded, and the first team is assembled. For the next training, we will change the way and stop fighting."
　　 The second team withdrew from the stadium. There were only one team of eight people in the field, waiting for Cao Fenglin's next instructions.
　　 "Xiao Lan and Yang Qingzhuo, Mo Xiu and Hu Xianming, play two-on-two!"
　　

 
       
 
           


　　Mo Xiu is a bit unclear about the number of people, so, aren’t you preparing for tomorrow’s team battle? How did you train for two to two?
　　 Cao Fenglin saw that a few people did not move, and said loudly, "What? I haven't taught you for a few days, don't you listen to me?"
　　Mo Xiu and the others heard Cao Fenglin say this, and they could only follow suit.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo was a little reluctant. He wanted to team up with Mo Xiu. After Mo Xiu's enlightenment, he decided to cooperate with the training.
　　Since you want to fight, you must fight seriously. Mo Xiu and the others are very serious, and they fought together from the beginning.
　　 Just when the four of them were fighting, Cao Fenglin suddenly shouted: "Stop it!"
　　 The four immediately stopped, and looked at Cao Fenglin with a dazed expression.
　　 Cao Fenglin turned his head to look at Mu Mu who was sitting aside and said, "When Mo Xiu was in trouble just now, how should Xiao Lan and Yang Qingzhuo cooperate to resolve their disadvantages?"
　　 Mumu was also questioned, but still gave the answer.
　　 Cao Fenglin said: "Yes, do you remember it?"
　　 Xiao Lan and Yang Qingzhuo nodded together.
　　 "Okay, if you remember, the game will continue!"
After 　　, it was not only two-on-two, but also three-on-three and four-on-four. When the manpower was insufficient, Mu Mu was all on.
　　 According to the situation of the game, Cao Fenglin asked Mu Mu to design a lot of cooperation.
　　 Yes, it is cooperation, not tactics, cooperation between two people, cooperation between three people, cooperation between four people, but there is no complete set of tactics.
　　Mo Xiu slowly understood Cao Fenglin's intentions. He wanted to cultivate everyone's tacit understanding when fighting together, sort out all the possible cooperation, and then leave the battlefield affairs to the players themselves.
　　 It's a bit like, I've given you the tricks, and it's up to you how to use them then.
　　 At the end of the day's training, Cao Fenglin let everyone disband, leaving only Mumu.
　　 Mumu asked worriedly: "Is this really okay? Isn't there a fixed tactic?"
Cao Fenglin smiled confidently: "You don't believe your teammates, Mo Xiu, maybe the most resilient person in the school. I'm talking about the whole school, including senior students and teachers. You can understand what a big advantage this is. ?"
　　 Mu Mu looked in shock at the direction where Mo Xiu was leaving at the door, unexpectedly Cao Fenglin had such a high evaluation of Mo Xiu.
  "I understand!"
　　 "You have to learn to trust your team members. They have trained together for a long time, and they have had enough tacit understanding. Everyone has subconsciously cooperated with Mo Xiu. Mo Xiu's resilience is so strong, no problem."
　　 Mumu said frustratedly: "But I always want to do more, maybe it will be more helpful to this team."
　　 Cao Fenglin said firmly: "A good mentor does not want to control the team to develop in a predetermined direction, but to stimulate their full potential and become a stronger team."
　　 Mumu's eyes gradually regained self-confidence, and he was confident in the game tomorrow.
　　 Cao Fenglin saw Mumu return to normal, and said with a smile on his face, "Are you ready? Okay, kiss!"
　　 "Go!"
　　...
　　 Mo Xiu and a few people walked out of the venue, preparing to have a meal in the cafeteria together.
When 　　 walked to the entrance of the cafeteria, Xiao Lan was a little strange and dodgy.
　　Mo Xiu looked back and realized that Xiao Hong was behind a few people, but why did Xiao Lan avoid Xiao Hong? Are they not sisters?
　　 It is strange to say that Mo Xiu has met Xiao Hong several times in total, all in the cafeteria.
　　 Mo Xiu asked Xiao Lan with his eyes if he wanted to say hello to Xiao Hong.
　　 Xiao Lan lowered his head slightly, and shook his head insignificantly.
　　 At this time, Xiao Hong's voice came.
　　 "Xiao Lan, when will you hide from me?"
　　 Xiao Lan saw that there was no longer any need to hide, and he walked out of the crowd.
　　 "Sister, I didn't avoid you."
　　 Xiao Hong snorted coldly: "Huh! Don't come to this one. You will go home from tomorrow and live in the dormitory no longer."
　　 Xiao Lan looked a little listless, reluctant to see it, opened his mouth and said, "Okay!"
　　 Xiao Hong looked at Mo Xiu and others behind Xiao Lan.
　　 "I asked you to report to the Elemental Department. You don't listen. Now you are with this bunch of rubbish, and you, you can't even get into the quarterfinals in the school civil war. It's really for me."
　　 Xiao Lan could only whisper: "I'm sorry, sister."
　　 Dong Fang didn’t know Xiao Hong. When someone said he was a trash, he immediately responded, “Who do you say is a trash?”
　　 Xiao Hong glanced over, and Dong Fang stared at her unconvinced.
　　 Mo Xiu quickly said in Dong Fang's ear: "She is the famous Xiao Hong."
　　 When it heard that it was Xiao Hong, Dong Fang immediately softened, lowering his head and dared not look at Xiao Hong.
　　 Although Mo Xiu felt that he shouldn't care about other people's housework, he always felt that Xiao Hong had said too much, and Xiao Lan was her younger sister after all.
　　 Mo Xiu clasped his fists and said, "Senior Sister Xiao Hong, we are just going to have a meal. Do you want to come with us?"
　　 Xiao Hong cast a glance and said to Xiao Lan: "Xiao Lan, you are not allowed to have any dealings with this kind of people in the future, don't embarrass my Xiao family."
　　 Mo Xiu was a little unhappy. He originally wanted to relieve Xiao Lan and at the same time show his favor to Xiao Hong, but he didn't expect Xiao Hong to have such an attitude.
　　 "Senior sister can make it clear, what kind of person am I?"
　　 Xiao Hong sneered: "I teach my sister, when is it someone else's turn to interrupt?"
　　 Although Mo Xiu has a good temper, he is never a person who can swallow his anger.
　　 immediately replied: "You said me, can't I ask? Then I am here today calling you Xiao Hong a shrew, can't you also ask?"
　　 Xiao Hong and Mo Xiu looked at each other for the first time, murderous in his eyes.
　　 "Well, after I came to Yenching University, you are the first person who dared to talk to me like this."
　　 Behind his hands, Mo Xiu said every word: "It doesn't matter who you talk to, I'm talking about reason."
　　 Xiao Hong walked step by step and stopped beside Mo Xiu.
　　 "I will show you what is rational today?!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo immediately stood in front of Xiao Hong and said: "Sister Xiao Hong, UU reading www.uukānshu.com Yanjing University has rules, seniors are not allowed to shoot at lower grades."
　　 "Yang Qingzhuo? You let me go!"
　　 Xiao Hong's voice was not as flat as it was at the beginning, but when he raised his voice, he was obviously angry.
　　 Mo Xiu took Yang Qingzhuo behind him and said, "It doesn't have to be so troublesome. How about I challenge you?"
　　 The audience was shocked, and now there are a lot of people gathered around, the big devil is going to challenge the third-grade hot goddess Xiao Hong? How rampant is this? It's just mortal.
　　 Xiao Hong narrowed his eyes slightly, and didn't understand what Mo Xiu's purpose was, so he dared to challenge himself.
　　 Mo Xiu saw that Xiao Hong didn't speak, and continued: "How about? Xiao Hong-senpai, then you can attack me."
　　 When these words came out, everyone thought that Mo Xiue wanted to commit suicide. When Xiao Hong didn't respond, he should just run away. How could he continue to provoke him?
　　 Xiao Hong calmed down instead and said lightly: "I don't want to care about you, because I know your identity and you are that apprentice."
　　 Mo Xiu was taken aback. The words were directed at Elder Tang, but how did Xiao Hong know?
　　 In fact, what Mo Xiu didn't know was that recently, the two brothers Wang Lei and Wang Yu remembered their mission, and they advertised that Mo Xiu was Tang's apprentice everywhere.
　　 Of course ordinary people don't know, but families with royal backgrounds like the Xiao family have known this news a long time ago.
　　 Mo Xiu said, "I don't understand what you mean."
　　 Xiao Hong smiled and said: "It's boring, I'll spare you this time today, but you must remember that no one can be a stumbling block and burden on my road, Xiao Lan can't do it, you... let alone."

　　 Xiao Hong dragged Xiao Lan to leave after speaking, and everyone onlookers was amazed. What is the origin of this Mo Xiu? Even Xiao Hong, a woman who is not afraid of anything, must be afraid of three points.
　　 After today, the fact that the Great Demon King Moxiu has an astonishing background can be considered solid.
　　 Mo Xiu several people went upstairs to eat, and the crowd dispersed.
At the dinner table, Dong Fang said admiringly: "Mo Xiu, I admire you more and more now. There is really a way to pick up girls. Even Xiao Hong dares to challenge. You challenged her to impress her in her heart. You will be waiting for opportunities in the future. And move, right?"
　　 Before Mo Xiu could speak, Yang Qingzhuo asked anxiously: "Mo Xiu, is this really the case?"
　　 Mo Xiu shone on Dong Fang’s head and said: “You don’t know anything other than picking up girls one day. I know that she will not surrender and fight against me, so I challenged her.”
　　 But even if Mo Xiu said so, several people still admire Mo Xiu's courage.
　　No one knew it was. In fact, the group of Mo Xiu panic felt nothing at first. When Mo Xiu saw Xiao Hong's skills, he immediately regretted the challenge. If Xiao Hong agreed, he might be beaten.
　　"One skill: Pyroblast 4
　　 Skill effect: At any place within 50 meters from the main body, summon a fire ball from the ground and explode.
　　 Cooling time: 30 minutes
　　 Two skills: Flame Gun 4
　　 Skill effect: Summon a flame gun, when held in hand, increase the body's attack power by 1,000%, 500% speed, and cause 2,000% explosive damage when thrown.
　　 Duration: 20 minutes
　　 Cooling time: one hour
　　 Three skills: Flame Goddess 5
Skill effect: body elementization, whole body attack with burning effect, immunity to 80% physical attack, 30% immunity to elemental attacks other than water, speed increase by 30%, additional skill: fireball (no Cooling time)
　　 Duration: Ten minutes
　　Cooling time: six hours"
　　 The first time Mo Xiu saw Level 4 and Level 5 skills, they were all on Xiao Hong.
　　 Xiao Hong's three skills are not only high-level, but one is more perverted. With a three-skill, they are immune to 80% of physical attacks, which cannot be defeated by the current Mo Xiu.
　　 In the universe cram school before, I heard Wang Yu said that the strongest known skill of the elemental system is elementalization.
　　 At that moment, Mo Xiu secretly prayed to Xiao Hong not to agree to his challenge.
　　 After dinner, Mo Xiu and Yang Qingzhuo returned home.
　　 At this time, Zheng Yi was holding Xiao Fushun at a loss.
　　 Mo Xiu asked quickly: "What happened to Xiao Fushun?"
Zheng Yi handed Xiao Fushun into Mo Xiu’s arms and said, "I don’t know. I didn’t see Xiao Fushun when I came back today. I felt something was wrong. He used to make tricks at home, but later in your bedroom. He was found lying in bed listless."
　　 Mo Xiu rubbed the head of Xiao Fushun in his arms. When Xiao Fushun opened his eyes and saw Mo Xiu, he let out a "meow~".
　　 Mo Xiu fixed his eyes, and suddenly the boss stared.
　　 "What's wrong with you Xiaofushun?"
　　 "Meow~"
　　 "Are you feeling well? Where does it hurt?"
　　 "Meow~"
　　 "Hmm, ok, then you can rest well."
　　 "Meow~"
　　 Zheng Yi and Yang Qingzhuo who watched were stunned, what's the situation?
　　 Zheng Yi asked: "Mo Xiu, do you understand what Xiao Fushun said?"
 "I dont understand!"
　　 "The conversation just now?"
　　 "I guess, I guess he wants to hibernate."
　　 Zheng Yi was originally serious, but Mo Xiu immediately retorted when he said that, "Big brother, don't make fun, Xiao Fushun will hibernate? Besides, it's summer."
　　 Mo Xiu said: "Go, get out of the way, know everything, prepare some meat and water in my room, and eat after Xiao Fushun wakes up."
After 　　 finished speaking, Mo Xiu walked away, leaving Zheng Yi very angry.
　　 "Me?...Hey, I will prepare now."
　　 Mo Xiu returned to the room, put Xiao Fushun on his bed, and then covered him with a quilt.
　　 In fact, the moment Mo Xiu got Xiao Fushun, he felt wrong, Xiao Fushun was weak and limp.
　　In desperation, Mo Xiu used God's Snoop on Xiao Fushun. The last time he successfully used a beast was during War Demon Shadow.
　　 In fact, Moxiu used God's Snoop once when Xiao Fushun first came, but he didn't read anything at the time.
　　 "Innate Skill: Awakening..."
　　 Mo Xiu immediately understood that Xiao Fushun is now in an awakened state, and that he is so weak. Just telling Zheng Yi to hibernate is just nonsense.
　　 But Mo Xiu can't figure it out. Isn't the talent of the beast innate? Why does Xiao Fushun need to be awakened? Now I can only take good care of Xiao Fushun.
　　 September 5, the last day of the preliminaries for the team battle in the school.
　　 Many people are looking forward to it, as the most interesting support team, the first team against the ability team, it is of course to be ranked last.
　　 There was no upset in the previous three games.
　　 The first team of the strong attack team, the first team of the elemental team, and the first team of the agile attack team successfully advanced, and now they are the last place.
　　 Today, Mu Mu's condition is much better, and the iconic hearty smile is on his face again.
　　 From the time I came to the venue until now, I haven't said a word about the next game, and I have been chatting with a few people about irrelevant things.
　　 is about to play, Mo Xiu asked Mumu: "Guide Mu, we are about to play, don't you have anything to explain?"
　　 Mumu still smiled and said, "Of course there is, that is..."
　　 Seeing Mu Mi's appearance, a few people thought there was a secret tactic, so they all leaned in to listen.
　　 "Then come on!"
　　 Mo Xiu, a few people looked at Mumu with a puzzled look~www.mtlnovel.com~ After so many preparations and analysis of so many data during the competition, they didn't say anything? This is too unlike Mu Mu.
　　 Mu Mu said earnestly: "I was wrong before. As a guide for this team, I now fully believe in your abilities and you can deal with all emergencies."
　　 "If there is one thing I am better than the ability department instructor, it is trust in you. We are no worse than any team. Come on."
　　 Mu Ming's words greatly boosted everyone's confidence.
　　 walked into the field with a different mood from the past, when the power department was standing on the opposite side.
　　 Bai Rui Mi said as soon as he came up: "Are you ready to be eliminated?"
　　 Mo Xiu saw the match between Bai Ruimi and Zhou Qiuwu last time, this person does not know an arrogant person.
　　 Bai Rui Mi's repeated provocations were just to irritate the support system and prevent the support system from performing normally during battle. After all, off-court interference is not a foul.
　　 Mo Xiu said directly: "You don't have to think of irritating us, our tempers are all very good, so let's speak with hard power."
As soon as he was seen through, Bai Ruimi said, "Hahaha, Brother Mo is very powerful. He can see the tricks underneath at a glance. I really admire him. Others say you are the big devil. I don’t think so. I think Whether you are a person or your strength, you are superior to others."
　　 Mo Xiu was embarrassed, did this guy become too fast? Just now I have spoken badly, now I'm flattering.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo held his small nose, and whispered beside Mo Xiu: "This person is shameless!"
　　 Although the voice was small, Bai Rui Mi heard it, but Bai Rui Mi didn't respond, and he bowed his hand to Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 This Bai Rui Mi... is really shameless.

　　 In the gap before the start of the game, Mo Xiu carefully observed the five opponents. As expected, the skills of four of them have been seen, but the last girl did not.
　　"One Skill: Enlargement 2
　　 Skill effect: Enlarge any part of the body, and increase all attributes of the enlarged part by 300%.
　　 Duration: Ten times within ten minutes, five seconds each time
　　Cooling time: three hours"
　　 After reading the skills of all five people in the power system, Mo Xiu's thoughts were very messy. The compatibility of these five skills was too strong, and there were too many tactics that could be used, and he couldn't sort out the countermeasures for a while.
　　 At this time, the host introduced the competition members.
　　 "Next is the most important match of the entire qualifiers, the first team of the auxiliary department will play against the first team of the ability department!"
  "Oh!!"
　　 The audience responded to the host with cheers.
　　 "The first thing I want to introduce is the auxiliary system. The five contestants are: Xiao Lan, Yang Qingzhuo, He Lingyue, Hu Xianming, and our Great Demon King... Mo Xiu!"
　　 "Next is the supernatural power system, and the five contestants are: Barry Mi..."
The five members of the power department are Bai Ruimi, Jiang Feng who has life link and deceiving skills, Qian Deshun who has the ability to paint a prison, Li Zhi who has petrochemical skills, and the last one, a girl with huge transformation skills. Chen Peipei.
　　 The host is still introducing, He Lingyue asked: "Mo Xiu, how do we fight in a while?"
　　 Mo Xiu thought for a while and said, "I will attack Xiao Lan in a while. Don't separate the three of you together."
　　 After Mo Xiu said this, the host announced the start of the game.
　　 The game has just begun, Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan first release their skills, two of them attack first, and the other three are behind, waiting for the opportunity.
None of the five people in the power department moved. After Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan arrived close by, Chen Peipei used the giantization skills to enlarge his right hand, grabbed Qian Deshun, and threw Qian Deshun to Mo Xiu. And behind Xiao Lan.
　　Mo Xiu remembered that Qian Deshun’s skill was to draw the ground as a prison. You must draw a circle on the ground to activate the skill. Among the three people behind, Hu Xianming and Yang Qingzhuo are not weak in combat abilities, and they should be able to cope with it.
　　 Mo Xiu didn't care. According to the plan, he and Xiao Lan, one of them dragged Bai Rui Mi, and the other killed as many other members as possible.
　　 But when Mo Xiu confronted Bai Rui Mi, he realized that something was wrong behind him.
　　 Qian Deshun did not draw a circle. Instead, he stepped on the boundary line of his foot. A yellow line appeared where he stepped on his foot. Then he ran quickly and drew a big arc. The three Yang Qingzhuo were all within the arc.
　　 Mo Xiu frowned. Qian Deshun couldn't activate his skills without drawing a complete circle. Could it be that his skills have been upgraded in just one day?
　　Following Qian Deshun’s running route, you must go out of bounds if you want to draw a complete circle...
　　 Thinking of this, Mo Xiu took a closer look at the traces of Qian Deshun's passing, forming a quarter circle in the circle.
　　Mo Xiu didn't understand until Qian Deshun ran out of bounds. Qian Deshun wanted to draw a complete circle at the price of going out of bounds, trapping the three people, and drew the remaining three-quarters of the circle outside the bounds.
　　 "Yang Qingzhuo, save Hu Xianming! Ah!"
　　 Mo Xiu shouted to remind Yang Qingzhuo, but he accidentally hit the laser from Barry Mi. The laser hit the lower abdomen, blood was already flowing out at this time.
　　 Looking back, Barry Mi was smiling at himself.
　　 "Brother Mo, you look down on me too much, and you are distracted from fighting with me."
　　 Mo Xiu quickly avoided the next laser beam from Barry Mi, and then tried to get him into the distance.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo acted immediately after receiving the order and added skills to himself and Hu Xianming, so that both of them had a 400% increase in speed.
　　 Although the two did not know what Qian Deshun was going to do, the yellow lines on the ground must be strange, and the two quickly ran out of the line.
　　 Although He Lingyue did not have a speed bonus, she tried hard to run outside the line.
　　 At the same time, Xiao Lan attacked Jiang Feng, Li Zhi and Chen Peipei.
　　 The battlefield was divided into three parts. Mo Xiu and Bai Ruimi dragged each other, Xiao Lan launched an attack, and Yang Qingzhuo tried their best to get out of the yellow line.
　　 Just then, a voice that can change the situation of the battle sounded.
　　 "Give it to me!"
　　 The voice was extremely loud and penetrating, and the three characters seemed to have some kind of curse. Mo Xiu paused for a while.
　　 Reflected this and immediately avoided Barry Mi’s attack and was almost injured.
　　 It was... not good! It was Jiang Feng's deceitful words that deceived the crowd.
　　 Looking at the other two sides, they were both in crisis.
　　Because each person's mental defense is different, the time of being immobilized is also different.
　　 Let me talk about Xiao Lan first. Just as Xiao Lan launched an attack, he was deceived by the horror. Chen Peipei did not let go of this opportunity, and directly enlarged his hands to hold Xiao Lan firmly, and Li Zhi quickly activated his skills to petrify.
　　 Xiao Lan just woke up at this time, and after struggling for a while, he was petrified again.
　　 The petrified state has improved defenses, but the speed has dropped to zero and it cannot move.
　　 Chen Peipei used Xiao Lan's petrochemical state to lift Xiao Lan high, wanting to throw it out of the field.
　　 On the other side, Yang Qingzhuo and Hu Xianming were advancing at full speed. They were stopped by the sudden sound and could not move.
　　Because Mo Xiu was worried about other people, he didn't notice Barry Mi, and another laser shot came.
　　 Three parties suffered, Mo Xiu was about to be injured, Xiao Lan was about to go out of bounds, and Qian Deshun was about to finish drawing the circle and trapped Yang Qingzhuo.
　　 At this very moment, five white lights appeared on the five auxiliary members almost simultaneously.
　　Mo Xiu here, UU reading www.uukanshu. com white light offsets the damage of the laser.
　　 On the side of Xiao Lan, the white light purified the negative state. Although it was still petrified, the speed recovered. At the moment when he was about to be thrown away, he grabbed Chen Peipei's finger and jumped to the ground with force.
　　 Yang Qingzhuo's side, San Simultaneously regained freedom. Before Qian Deshun finished the circle, Yang Qingzhuo and Hu Xianming ran out of the circle.
　　 The five white lights are exactly Hu Xianming's holy light. The body is frozen, but the consciousness is still there. Hu Xianming has an idea to show the operation of God.
　　 Mumu hurriedly exhaled when he was off the court, it was too dangerous.
　　 The opponent's guidance is definitely not simple. The tactics and cooperation of the ability system are amazing. Mu Mu admitted that his previous tactics were useless. Fortunately, he allowed the players to play freely, thanks to Hu Xianming's god-level operation.
　　 was not only Mumu, but the audience exclaimed. When the tactics of the power system were played, almost everyone thought that the game was about to end, but there would be such a turning point.
　　 A nanny's **** operation pulled the entire team out of the abyss. The ability system tactics failed, and one player was lost. Qian Deshun was eliminated from the bounds.
　　 Mo Xiu smiled in the field. He was disturbed. From the beginning of the game, he was thinking about how to deal with the opponent's skills. Such thinking turned into a burden, preventing him from letting go of his hands and feet.
　　 It wasn't until Hu Xianming's five white lights came on that Mo Xiu really took the reassurance. With such an excellent teammate, what else is there to worry about? Just let it go.
　　 The ability department did not expect this situation, the situation of winning, was inexplicably resolved, and the four players on the field were a little at a loss.
　　 Bai Rui Mi was stunned, and said to Mo Xiu: "What's the situation?"
　　 Mo Xiu smiled slightly and said, "Do you still have to ask? My nanny is super amazing!"
　　

    
   


　　 The ability system is still well-trained, and after a brief panic, it immediately returns to the fighting state.
　　 Chen Peipei was still huge with both hands, grabbed Jiang Feng and Li Zhi, and threw them into the distance one by one, aiming at Qian Deshun's circle.
　　 Because of the high height of the throw, Xiao Lan couldn't stop him, and could only watch the two enter the circle.
　　 At this time, there was only He Lingyue in the circle. The moment Li Zhi and Jiang Feng fell into the circle, He Lingyue made a decisive decision to release the future man with the skills to Mo Xiu, and then walked out of the circle by herself.
　　 This is the best solution He Lingyue can think of. If you add skills to yourself and fight with the two, it is not certain whether you can win or not, and your skills will be wasted.
　　If the skills are not supported, it will be more than worthwhile to be stunned and unconscious. It is better to simply hand over the near skills to Mo Xiu, and go out of bounds to avoid being stunned. Mo Xiu also gets the skills.
　　 Mo Xiu got the skills of the future man, and he was relieved a lot, and he could predict the direction of the Barry Mi Laser.
　　 Xiao Lan had many advantages against Chen Peipei and forced Chen Peipei to retreat steadily.
　　 At this moment, Bai Ruimi spread his wings and flew directly to Chen Peipei's side and picked him up.
　　 Bai Ruimi hugged Chen Peipei and flew in the air, but Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan couldn't help it.
　　 Bai Rui Mi said: "I will not forget, right? I can fly."
　　 The current situation is that the ability system has two people in the air and two people in the circle.
　　 Mo Xiu promptly said: "Into the circle!"
　　 Yang Qingzhuo and Hu Xianming are the closest, they lead the first circle to attack Li Zhi and Jiang Feng.
　　 Mo Xiu and Xiao Lan also rushed at full speed, but the two of them were not as fast as Bai Rui Mi's laser.
　　 A laser shot directly in front of Yang Qingzhuo and the two, making it impossible for them to continue their attack.
　　 Afterwards, Barry Mi was flying faster, so he flew directly in front of Li Zhi and Jiang Feng, and the two of them grabbed Barry Mi's leg.
　　 Just like that, Barry Mi flew up with three teammates.
　　 At this moment, the time limit for drawing the ground as a prison came, and the circle disappeared.
　　 Mo Xiu looked at Barry Mi in the sky for a while, what kind of rogue tactic is this?
After 　　, the audience on the scene saw a strange scene, Barrymy dragged three people and shot lasers downward in the sky.
　　Mo Xiu ran back and forth to avoid the laser on the ground.
　　 This situation lasted for two minutes, causing the audience to become a little impatient.
　　 "Can you tell the winner like this?"
　　 "The ability system is obviously stronger, why use such a tactic?"
　　 "The ability system has pinned all hopes on the first tactics, and now it's a poor skill."
　　 Mo Xiu avoids while thinking, what is the purpose of Barry Mi doing this?
　　 Although there are two strong attack points on the auxiliary system, the ability system is not weak, why is it so time-consuming.
　　 Mo Xiu suddenly thought of a possibility, Li Zhi's petrochemical skills, the cooling time is three minutes, it should be almost the same now.
　　 At this moment, Li Zhi suddenly dropped his hands in the air and fell to the ground.
　　 Due to the constant harassment from Barry Mi, the four members of the auxiliary system have long since lost their formation. At this time, the four of them are separated.
　　 Xiao Lan and Hu Xianming, who were closest to the drop point, were a little annoyed by the harassment. When they saw someone falling, they ran directly and attacked without even thinking about it.
　　 Mo Xiu shouted: "Don't go over!!"
　　 Unfortunately, it was too late. The two had arrived and launched an attack.
　　 Just as the two hit Li Zhi, Li Zhi used petrification on himself, increasing his defense by 800%, and resisting the two blows.
　　 Just when the two of Xiao Lan were about to push Li Zhi out of the world, a laser shot hit Xiao Lan.
　　 When Hu Xianming saw this, he immediately prepared to use the Holy Light for treatment. Unfortunately, before the Holy Light was released, a huge palm patted Hu Xianming and fainted.
　　 Hu Xianming eliminated!
　　 Even though Yang Qingzhuo had applied all his skills to Mo Xiu at that moment, Mo Xiu had a speed of 800%, but he still could not save Hu Xianming.
　　 Hu Xianming was eliminated, and Chen Peipei, Li Zhi and Jiang Feng attacked the injured Xiao Lan at the same time.
　　 Mo Xiu wanted to support, but was stopped by Bai Rui Mi.
　　 But now Mo Xiu's speed is too fast, even if he is flown by Remi, he can't live in Mo Xiu.
